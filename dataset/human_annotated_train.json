      "Newton D . Baker House",
      "Newton D . Baker House , also known as Jacqueline Kennedy House , is a historic house at 3017 N Street NW in Washington , D.C. . Built in 1794 , it was home of Newton D . Baker , who was Secretary of War , during 1916-1920 , while he presided over Americas mass mobilization of men and material in World War I . After the assassination of president John F . Kennedy in 1963 , Jacqueline Kennedy purchased the house and lived here for about a year .",
      "It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976 .",
      "History .",
      "The house was built in 1794 by Thomas Beall . During its early years , the house was situated on a large plot of land and was said to have had a servants wing attached to the east side . At that time N Street was known as Gay Street and was situated higher than today .",
      "In 1796 , John Laird , a wealthy merchant , lived in the house , and later Maj . George Peter , a War of 1812 commander and Maryland Congressman , purchased the house who lived there until 1827 , when the same Laird bought the house for his son . In 1834 , William Redin , the first auditor of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia , purchased it .",
      "In 1868 , Redins unmarried daughter inherited and sold the dwelling , which became the Georgetown Female Seminary . The Seminary had a student body of boarders and day students totaling 105 . In approximately 1890 , John H . Smoot bought the building and converted it back to a private residence again .",
      "In 1915 , Col . William E . Pattison French purchased the house , and began renting it to Newton D . Baker in 1916 . When Baker returned to Cleveland in 1920 , French either leased or lived in the house himself for more than two decades . During the World War II , the British military attache occupied the house and rented rooms to British officers .",
      "After the World War II , Vice Admiral Alan Kirk , later Ambassador to Belgium and to the Soviet Union , purchased the property . Three years later , Dr . E . H . Gushing bought the home along with his wife . They sold the attached servants wing as a separate residence to Mr . and Mrs . Stanley Woodward who built a new front entrance and lived in the home . The Cushings updated the main houses electrical wiring and plumbing and removed some of the interior walls therefore enlarging the living room .",
      "In 1954 , James McMillan Gibson bought the dwelling , added a small rear wing , and installed an elevator and lived there with his wife .",
      "In 1964 , Jacqueline Kennedy purchased the house and lived in it shortly after the assassination of president John F . Kennedy in 1963 . The Kennedy family lived here for about a year .",
      "In 1965 , Michael Whitney Straight purchased the home for $200,000 ( ) , from Kennedy when she moved to New York City . While living in the home , Straight married his second wife , Nina G . Auchincloss Steers in 1974 . Nina was the daughter of Nina Gore and Hugh D . Auchincloss . She was the half-sister of writer Gore Vidal and coincidentally , a stepsister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . Straight and his wife spent $125,000 ( ) renovating the home and decided to move to Bethesda , Maryland in 1976 when he was vice chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts . Straight and his wife lived in the home from until 1976 .",
      "In 1976 , Yolande Bebeze Fox , the former Miss America 1951 , bought the home from Straight . Fox lived in the home until her death in February 2016 .",
      "Architectural details .",
      "The home is considered more representative of New England architecture than other contemporary Georgetown homes . The house has many architectural details including a wide limestone stairway , pink-painted lintels with keystones , brick voussoirs , Doric pilasters , and a semi-elliptical fanlight .",

      "Elizabeth Diane Downs ( n\u00e9e Frederickson ; born August 7 , 1955 ) is an American criminal who murdered her daughter and attempted to murder her other two children in May 1983 . Following the crimes , she told police a man had attempted to carjack her and had shot the children . She was convicted in 1984 and sentenced to life in prison plus fifty years .",
      "Downs briefly escaped in 1987 and was recaptured . She is the subject of a book by Ann Rule and a made-for-TV movie based upon it , both called Small Sacrifices . She was denied parole in December 2008 and again in December 2010 ; her next hearing is set for 2021 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Diane Downs was born in Phoenix , Arizona , on August 7 , 1955 , to parents Wesley Linden ( 1930\u20132017 ) and Willadene ( Engle ) Frederickson . She has testified that her father sexually abused her when she was 12 years old . Diane graduated from Moon Valley High School in Phoenix where she met her husband , Steve Downs . After high school , she enrolled at Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College in Orange , California , but was expelled after one year for promiscuous behavior , and soon returned to her parents home in Arizona .",
      "On November 13 , 1973 , Diane married Steve Downs after running away from home . Their first child , Christie Ann , was born in 1974 . Cheryl Lynn followed in 1976 , with Stephen Daniel being born in 1979 . The couple divorced in 1980 because Steve thought Stephen Daniel , known as Danny , was the result of an affair Diane had .",
      "On May 8 , 1982 , Downs gave birth to a daughter through surrogacy . She named the child Jennifer before turning her over to her intended parents . Prior to her arrest , Downs was employed by the United States Postal Service , assigned to the mail routes in the city of Cottage Grove , Oregon . Cheryl Lynn , shortly before her death , reportedly told a neighbor of her grandparents that she was afraid of her mother .",
      "Shootings .",
      "On May 19 , 1983 , Downs shot her three children and drove them in a blood-spattered car to McKenzie-Willamette Hospital . Upon arrival , Cheryl ( aged 7 ) was already dead , Danny ( aged 3 ) was paralyzed from the waist down , and Christie ( aged 8 ) had suffered a disabling stroke . Downs herself had been shot in the left forearm . She claimed she was carjacked on a rural road near Springfield , Oregon , by a strange man who shot her and the children . However , investigators and hospital workers became suspicious because they decided her manner was too calm for a person who had experienced such a traumatic event . She also made a number of statements that both police and hospital workers considered highly inappropriate .",
      "Suspicions heightened when Downs , upon arrival at the hospital to visit her children , phoned Robert Knickerbocker , a married man and former coworker in Arizona with whom she had been having an extramarital affair . The forensic evidence did not match her story ; there was no blood spatter on the drivers side of the car , nor was there any gunpowder residue on the drivers door or on the interior door panel . Knickerbocker also reported to police that Downs had stalked him and seemed willing to kill his wife if it meant that she could have him to herself ; he stated that he was relieved that she had left for Oregon and that he was able to reconcile with his wife .",
      "Downs did not disclose to police that she owned a .22 caliber handgun , but both Steve Downs and Knickerbocker informed them that she did . Investigators later discovered Downs bought the handgun in Arizona . While they were unable to find the actual weapon , they found unfired casings in her home with extractor markings from the murder weapon . Most damaging , witnesses saw her car being driven very slowly toward the hospital at an estimated speed of , contradicting her claim that she drove to the hospital at high speed after the shooting . Based on this and additional evidence , Downs was arrested on February 28 , 1984 , nine months after the shooting , and charged with one count of murder and two counts each of attempted murder and criminal assault .",
      "Prosecution .",
      "Prosecutors argued that Downs shot her children to be free of them so she could continue her affair with Knickerbocker , as she claimed that he let it be known that he did not want children in his life . Much of the case against her rested on the testimony of her surviving daughter , Christie , who , once she recovered her ability to speak , described how her mother shot all three children while parked at the side of the road and then shot herself in the arm .",
      "Downs was convicted on all charges on June 17 , 1984 , and sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years . She was required to serve 25 years before being considered for parole . Psychiatrists diagnosed her with narcissistic , histrionic , and antisocial personality disorders . Most of her sentence is to be served consecutively . The judge made it clear that he did not intend for Downs to ever be free again .",
      "Aftermath .",
      "Downs two surviving children eventually went to live with the lead prosecutor on the case , Fred Hugi . He and his wife Joanne adopted them in 1986 .",
      "Prior to her arrest , Downs became pregnant with a fourth child and gave birth to a girl , whom she named Amy Elizabeth , a month after her 1984 trial . Ten days before Downs sentencing , Amy was seized by the State of Oregon and adopted by Chris and Jackie Babcock , who named her Rebecca . As an adult , Rebecca appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and ABCs 20/20 discussing how she feels about her biological mother . She wrote to Downs in her younger years and has stated that she regrets it , regarding her mother as a monster .",
      "Downs was incarcerated at the Oregon Womens Correctional Center in Salem .",
      "She escaped from her cell in Oregon on July 11 , 1988 by scaling an 18-foot razor wire fence . For ten days Downs managed to escape despite a 14-state manhunt before she was recaptured . She received an additional five-year sentence for the escape . After her recapture , Downs was transferred to the New Jersey Department of Corrections Clinton Correctional Facility for Women after heavy lobbying from Hugi . The Salem prison was located 66 miles from Hugis home in Springfield ; during her ten days of freedom , Hugi had feared that Downs would attempt to travel there in hopes of contacting Christie and Danny . Despite significant security upgrades at the womens facility after the escape , state officials accepted Hugis argument that the risk of harm to Christie and Danny in the event of another escape was too great for Downs to remain incarcerated in Oregon .",
      "In 1994 , after serving ten years , Downs was transferred to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . While in prison , she has earned an associate degree in General Studies . In 2010 , she was located in the Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla , California , but transferred out when the facility was converted to an all-male institution in 2013 .",
      "Author Ann Rule wrote the book Small Sacrifices ( 1987 ) detailing Downs life and murder trial . The book documents accounts by friends , acquaintances , neighbors , and her surviving daughter Christie , who question the quality of her parenting . A made-for-TV movie also titled Small Sacrifices , starring Farrah Fawcett as Downs , aired on ABC in 1989 .",
      "Parole hearing .",
      "Downs sentence meant she could not be considered for parole until 2009 . Under Oregon law at the time , as a dangerous offender , Downs would have been eligible for a parole hearing every two years until she is released or dies in prison .",
      "In her first application for parole in 2008 , Downs reaffirmed her innocence . Over the years , she said , I have told you and the rest of the world that a man shot me and my children . I have never changed my story . Her first parole hearing was on December 9 , 2008 . Lane County District Attorney Douglas Harcleroad wrote to the parole board , Downs continues to fail to demonstrate any honest insight into her criminal behavior...even after her convictions , she continues to fabricate new versions of events under which the crimes occurred . He also wrote that she alternately refers to her assailants as a bushy-haired stranger , two men wearing ski masks or drug dealers and corrupt law enforcement officials . Downs participated in the hearing from the Valley State Prison for Women . She was not permitted a statement , but answered questions from the parole board . After three hours of interviews and thirty minutes of deliberation , she was denied parole .",
      "Downs faced her second parole hearing on December 10 , 2010 , and was denied . Her next parole hearing is scheduled for 2021 ."

      "Engelbert Endrass ( ) ( 2 March 1911 \u2013 21 December 1941 ) was a German U-boat commander in World War II . He commanded the and the , being credited with sinking 22 ships on ten patrols , for a total of of Allied shipping , to purportedly become the 23rd highest claiming U-boat commander of World War II .",
      "He was a recipient of the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves of Nazi Germany . It was Germanys highest military decoration at the time of its presentation to Endrass .",
      "Early life and career .",
      "Endrass began his naval career in April 1935 . After some months on the cruiser and service on escort ships , he was assigned in October 1937 to the U-boat force . He joined in December 1938 as Leutnant zur See .",
      "World War II .",
      "Engelbert Endrass was Watch Officer when his commanding officer , G\u00fcnther Prien penetrated the defences at Scapa Flow attack and sank the battleship in October 1939 . The snorting bull emblem on U-47s conning tower was painted by Endrass before they returned . Endrass painted this symbol on all subsequent boats on which he served . The reason , given by Endrass for this , was the sight of Priens demeanour as U-47 entered Scapa Flow , his frowning face and hunched shoulders reminded him of a bull in a ring . Endrass remained on U-47 until May 1940 , when he left and took over command of from the relatively unsuccessful Herbert Sohler , who had only sunk two ships in five patrols . Endrass had immediate success . He sank the British auxiliary cruiser on his first patrol . The patrol yielded over 4,000 tons .",
      "Endrass success continued on his second patrol with U-46 , sinking five more ships , including another British auxiliary cruiser , although the main periscope was damaged . The ship carried 23,225 steel drums and 2,700 wooden barrels and 440 tons of timber . Endrass was forced to use three torpedoes , for the drums fitted to British ships in this period was done so deliberately to provide extra ballast . It made sinking them more difficult and more expensive in munitions expenditure . Her loss prompted Commander-in-Chief , Western Approaches , Martin Dunbar-Nasmith to order all Liverpool\u2013bound ships to remain in convoy until past the Mull of Kintyre . 277 survivors were rescued by HMS Harvester and HMS Primrose .",
      "Endrass and six other U-boats intercepted Convoy SC 7 and sank many ships . U-46 sank three during the three-day battle . The commander followed this up with an attack on Convoy HX 79 , sinking two ships .",
      "Five patrols later he received the Oak Leaves to his Knights Cross . The presentation was made on 30 June 1941 by Adolf Hitler at the F\u00fchrer Headquarter Wolfsschanze ( Wolfs Lair ) in Rastenburg ( now K\u0119trzyn in Poland ) .",
      "In September 1941 Endrass left U-46 , which would become a training vessel , and a month later took over . On his second patrol , he was killed on 21 December 1941 while operating against Convoy HG 76 , when U-567 was sunk with all hands by depth charges from the British sloop and corvette , northeast of the Azores .",

      "Vologda",
      "Vologda ( ) is a city and the administrative , cultural , and scientific center of Vologda Oblast , Russia , located on the river Vologda within the watershed of the Northern Dvina . Population : 293,046 ( 2002 Census ) ;",
      "The city serves as a major transport hub of the Northwest of Russia . The Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation has classified Vologda as an historic city , one of forty-one in Russia and one of only three in Vologda Oblast . 224 buildings in Vologda have been officially recognized as cultural heritage monuments .",
      "History .",
      "Foundation .",
      "Two conflicting theories exist as to the date of Vologdas foundation .",
      "The year 1147 is the official date first fixed in 1780 by Alexey Zasetsky in his book Stories about miracles of Gerasimus of Vologda . The story mentions that in 1147 the Trinity Monastery was founded close to the river Vologda . The date of the foundation of the monastery is then taken as the date of the foundation of the city of Vologda and is mentioned in official city documents . This date , which would make Vologda to be of the same age as Moscow , is , however , not supported by any scientific data and is considered by authoritative sources to be fictional . The story was only written in 1666 by a certain Foma , who got a request from Archbishop Markel to produce the vita of Gerasimus . Foma himself admitted that he had no sufficient data on the biography . The story contains many contradicting details . Besides , the monastic life in the Russian north was not known in the 12th century : the first monastery in Vladimir was founded in 1152 , in Rostov in 1212 , in the Belozersk area in 1251 . Archeological excavations do not confirm this date either . Instead , they demonstrate that the city of Vologda was founded in the 13th century .",
      "The year 1264 was the first mention of Vologda when it was included in the list of possessions of the Novgorod Republic in the agreement between the Republic and the Grand Prince of Vladimir . This date is also supported by archaeological data .",
      "The nucleus of Vologda in the 13th century was not located in the area which is now the city center , but rather the area known now as Lazy ground ( ) , close to the Resurrection church . This area was the center of Vologda up to 1565 . Until that year , no stone constructions existed in Vologda ; all of the city fortifications , bridges , houses , churches , and industrial enterprises were made of wood .",
      "Before the 16th century .",
      "The unique position of Vologda on important waterways connecting Moscow , Novgorod , and the White Sea ( via the Northern Dvina ) made it attractive for the Novgorod Republic , as well as for the princes of Tver and Moscow , who fought numerous wars between the 13th and the 15th centuries .",
      "In 1371 , Dmitry Prilutsky , a monk from the Nikolsky Monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky , founded Nikolsky Monastery , now known as Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery , close to the city . Dmitry Donskoy , the Grand Prince of Moscow , was the chief benefactor of the monastery and viewed it as a stronghold of the influence of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the Northern lands in competition with Novgorod .",
      "In 1397 , during the reign of Vasily I , Vologda was added to the Grand Duchy of Moscow . Subsequently , the city was several times attacked by Novgorod forces . During the Muscovite Civil War , Vologda played a key role . After Vasily II the Blind , the Grand Prince of Moscow , was defeated by Dmitry Shemyaka in 1447 , he swore to never start a war against Shemyaka , was exiled to Vologda , and got the city as a personal possession . From there Vasily traveled to the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery where the hegumen released him from the oath . The civil war continued , and in 1450 , Vologda was besieged by the troops of Dmitry Shemyaka ; however , they did not manage to occupy the town .",
      "After the death of Vasily in 1462 , Vologda passed to the possession of his son Andrey Menshoy and became the center of the Principality of Vologda . In 1481 , after the death of Andrey who had no successors , Vologda passed to Ivan III , the Grand Duke of Moscow , and was included to the Grand Duchy of Moscow .",
      "Times of Ivan the Terrible .",
      "During the reign of Tsar Ivan the Terrible , Vologda became one of the major transit centers of Russias trade . The foreign trade was conducted mostly with England , Holland , and other western countries via the White Sea . Arkhangelsk was the major foreign trade haven , and Vologda stood on the waterway connecting Moscow with Arkhangelsk . The trade with Siberia was conducted via the Sukhona and the Vychegda , and Vologda also played an important role as a transit center . The state courtyard was built in the city on the bank of the Vologda . In 1553 , Vologda was visited by the English seafarer Richard Chancellor who officially established diplomatic relations between the Tsardom of Russia and England . In 1554 , trading agent John Gass described Vologda to English merchants as a city with an abundance of bread where the goods were twice as cheap as in Moscow and Novgorod , and that there was no city in Russia that would not trade with Vologda . Following the reports of John Gass , in 1555 England opened a trading office in the city , and the first Russian ambassador sent to England for negotiations became Osip Nepeya , a native of Vologda .",
      "In 1565 , Ivan the Terrible introduced the policy of Oprichnina and included Vologda into the structure of Oprichnina lands . That year , he visited the city for the first time and decided to make it the center of Oprichnina and consequently the capital of the country . The Tsar ordered to build a new fortress . It was decided to build it not in the former town center , but rather in another part of the town , limited on the one side by the river , and on the other side by what are now Leningradskaya , Oktyabrskaya , and Mira Streets . The fortress was surrounded by a moat . Ivan the Terrible traveled to Vologda in person to supervise the foundation of the fortress on April 28 , 1566 , which was the day to celebrate the memory of Saint Jason ( Nason in Russian tradition ) and Saint Sosipater . Therefore , the territory of the fortress located in the new part of Vologda was named the Nason-gorod ( Nason-town ) . The other name of the Nason-gorod was the Vologda Kremlin ( currently the name is sometimes referred only to the Bishops courtyard ) .",
      "Between 1568 and 1570 , a new cathedral was built in the new fortress . The Saint Sophia Cathedral became the first stone building in Vologda . The design of the cathedral copied the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin . This was the idea of Ivan the Terrible who wanted to make his new capital similar to Moscow . He personally supervised the construction , headed by the architect Razmysl Petrov . In 1571 , Vologda became the center of the Diocese of Vologda and Perm that was formed in 1492 and previously had its main church in the distant settlement of Ust-Vym in Perm lands . Thereby , Vologda was strengthened not only in trading , military and political influence , but also in ecclesiastical affairs .",
      "However , in 1571 Ivan the Terrible unexpectedly stopped the construction work in Vologda and left the city for good . Presumably , this was connected with his decision to abolish Oprichnina , and Vologda was not needed as the second capital any longer . According to the legend , when Ivan visited the Saint Sophia Cathedral , a little stone fell from the roof on his head . The superstitious Tsar who received a serious head injury took it as an sign of misfortune and decided to leave the city . In any case , it is known that the Tsar wanted even to demolish the cathedral , and that the cathedral was never consecrated during his lifetime . The consecration took place only during the reign his son Feodor I in 1587 . Parts of the incomplete fortress which were later in the 17th century strengthened with wooden walls stayed up to the 19th century when they were disassembled by the city authorities and local residents and used as a material for stone building .",
      "Time of Troubles .",
      "The Time of Troubles for Vologda began with a plague epidemic in 1605 . In 1608 , when Russia was split into areas controlled by Tsar Vasily Shuysky and areas controlled by the pretender False Dmitry II supported by Polish troops , the people of Vologda made an oath to False Dmitry . By gaining Vologda not only did he get control over Russian and English trading warehouses , but he also positioned himself to gain control over northern Russia . However , abuses and property seizures by the new administration sent to Vologda caused extreme discontent among the population . As a result , Vologda denounced False Dmitry II and supported Shuysky . Moreover , in February 1609 a national home guard headed by Nikita Vysheslavtsev was formed in Vologda and went to fight against False Dmitry II .",
      "In 1612 , people of Vologda rendered sizable food and military help to the home guard organized by Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky , which eventually defeated Polish troops . However , after the city sent huge military forces to support the second home guard , it remained without sufficient protection , and on September 22 , 1612 one of the Lithuanian extortionate groups seized Vologda without resistance , later burning down the city and killing and imprisoning many of its inhabitants .",
      "Under the Romanovs .",
      "After 1613 , Vologda quickly recovered due to its convenient location and once again became an important center of foreign trade . During the reign of Peter the Great , Vologda became one of the main military bases of Russia . Military and technical equipment for fortresses and military ships under construction was stored there . Vessels which delivered food supplies to Arkhangelsk were constructed in Vologda . Peter intended to hold them on Lake Kubenskoye , north of Vologda . However , after personally inspecting the lake in 1692 , he abandoned the idea deciding that the lake is improper for that purpose .",
      "Peter the Great visited Vologda on no less than ten occasions , on six of which ( in 1692 , 1693 , 1694 , 1702 , 1722 , and 1724 ) he stayed in the city for extended time . He always stayed in a small house of the Dutch merchant Goutman , which in 1872 was bought by the city authorities , and in 1885 was transformed into the memorial museum of Peter the Great and became the first museum of Vologda .",
      "However , after St . Petersburg was founded and foreign trade was rerouted to the Baltic Sea , the importance of Vologda as a center of foreign trade decayed . In 1722 , Peter issued the decree restricting trade through Arkhangelsk , which damaged Vologda even further . In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 , Vologda lost its functions as an administrative center and was included as a town of Archangelgorod Governorate .",
      "The revival began only during the reign of Catherine the Great who in 1780 made Vologda the center of Vologda Viceroyalty , a successor of Archangelgorod Governorate . In 1796 , the viceroyalty , administered by a governor-general , was transformed into Vologda Governorate , the borders of which stretched up to the Ural mountains in the east . The center of Vologda was rebuilt according to the plan of a provincial city issued in 1781 . The street network is still in use now .",
      "A new economic lifting of the city was connected with a steamship movement across the Sukhona and with the building of a new railroad line connecting Vologda with Yaroslavl and Moscow ( 1872 ) , with Arkhangelsk ( 1898 ) , with St . Petersburg and Vyatka ( 1905 ) .",
      "In 1871 , the Danish merchant Friedrich Buman opened a specialized butter factory in the manor of Fominskoye , from Vologda . It was the first butter factory both in Vologda Governorate and in Russia . Since then Vologda became the center of the butter industry , and the Vologda butter , a special type of butter with the taste of nuts invented by Nikolay Vereschagin and Buman , became a world trademark . In 1911 , the manor of Fominskoye together with the Bumans creamery was given to the state and became the base for the Vologda dairy institute . Thereby Vologda turned to one of the largest dairy centers of Russia .",
      "Since the 15th century , Vologda was a political exile destination and was even known as Siberia close to the capital . In the 19th\u201320th centuries , such persons as Joseph Stalin , Vyacheslav Molotov ( later the Minister of Foreign Affairs ) , Nikolai Berdyaev ( the famous Russian philosopher ) , Boris Savinkov ( later known as a successful terrorist ) , Mariya Ulyanova , and Alexander Bogdanov were sent to Vologda . Anatoly Lunacharsky chose to go there to join Bogdanov , and to marry Anna Alexandrovna Malinovskaya , Bogdanovs sister .",
      "Soviet period .",
      "Soviet power was established in Vologda in December 1917 , and up to the summer of 1918 co-existed with the zemstvo and municipal administration . In February 1918 , Vologda became the diplomatic capital of Russia for several months . Embassies located in Saint Petersburg were threatened by the German army , so Western powers , led by American Ambassador David R . Francis , relocated them to Vologda . However , pressured by the Bolsheviks , on July 24 , 1918 the diplomats were compelled to leave Vologda and repatriate via Arkhangelsk .",
      "During the Russian Civil War , Vologda was the location of the headquarters of the 6th Red Army . The army opposed the White Army under command of Evgeny Miller and the military forces of Entente in northern Russia .",
      "In 1924 the government ordered to close the Vsegradsky cathedral , that used to be one of the biggest and most revered in the city . In 1929 , the Vologda Governorate was abolished and included into the structure of a new formation , Northern Krai , which also included former Arkhangelsk and Northern Dvina Governorates , as well as the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast . The administrative center of Northern Krai was located in Arkhangelsk . In December 1936 , Northern Krai was abolished and divided into the Komi ASSR and Northern Oblast , with the administrative center still located in Arkhangelsk . On September 23 , 1937 , Northern Oblast was divided into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast by the decision of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union . According to the same decision , districts of former Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast were attached to Vologda Oblast . These districts currently make for the western part of Vologda Oblast . Thereby the current borders of Vologda Oblast were determined .",
      "In the 1930s , a flax factory , a coach-repair factory , and a sawmill , Northern Communard , were constructed .",
      "During World War II , martial law was declared in Vologda , and its industrial enterprises shifted to military production . In the fall of 1941 , Finnish troops crossed the borders of Vologda Oblast , and Vologda thus became a front city . The inhabitants were mobilized to dig trenches . In the city , bomb-proof shelters and elementary shelters were under construction , systems of air defense which protected the railway junction and the military-industrial enterprises were developed . As a result , though attempts of bombardments were numerous , no bombs fell on the city . To commemorate these events , a monument to the air defense forces was later erected on Zosimovskaya Street in Vologda . The monument has the shape of an anti-aircraft gun . In addition , Vologda was a railway hub used to supply the army and to evacuate equipment . It also served as a large hospital center . Residents of Vologda donated blood , money , and jewellery . The tank detachment Vologda Collective Farmer was funded by these donations . To commemorate these events the monument to the tank T-34 was built on Mira Street .",
      "Between 1961 and 1985 , Anatoly Drygin was the first secretary of the CPSU Vologda Oblast Committee and the head of the oblast . During this period , notable changes in many aspects of economy both of the city and of the oblast occurred . In particular , a bearing plant , a mechanical plant , and an optical-mechanical factory were built in Vologda . A polytechnical university was opened . A large-scale poultry farm was established . A major construction initiative was carried out , and , in particular , the first buildings higher than five floors were constructed . The city expanded , with new residential areas built ; in particular , Byvalovo , GPZ , the 5th and the 6th Microdistricts . In 1976 , the Vologda trolleybus system opened .",
      "Post-Soviet period .",
      "In November 1991 , the city administration was formed and the reform of local governments began . In October 1993 , the Soviets of Peoples Deputies of all levels were abolished . After the dissolution of the Vologda Soviet , the City Duma was established . The first Duma elections took place on March 20 , 1994 . This first Duma only had six seats , but in 1995 , after the next elections , it was expanded to thirty deputies .",
      "On July 25 , 1996 , the City Duma adopted the main city document : the Charter of Vologda . On October 6 , 1996 , the first mayoral elections in the history of Vologda took place . Alexey Yakunichev was elected and became the head of the city . His term ended in 2008 .",
      "In 2003 , the construction of a ring road started . Before that , the \u041c8 highway connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk ran through the city center , causing congestion . Since the completion , the ring road connects the highways \u0410114 ( Vologda \u2013 Novaya Ladoga ) , \u04205 ( Vologda \u2013 Medvezhyegorsk ) , and \u041c8 ( Moscow \u2013 Arkhangelsk ) . On August 25 , 2005 , the City Duma approved the new Charter of Vologda . Even though the deputies introduced more than four hundred amendments and the document increased more than twice in volume as compared with the Charter of 1996 , the changes were relatively minor . On October 12 , 2008 , Yevgeny Shulepov was elected to be the City Head .",
      "Administrative and municipal status .",
      "Vologda is the administrative center of the oblast and , within the framework of administrative divisions , it also serves as the administrative center of Vologodsky District , even though it is not a part of it .

      "Chelyabinsk ( ) is a city and the administrative center of Chelyabinsk Oblast , Russia . It is the seventh-largest city in Russia by population , with 1,130,132 inhabitants as of the 2010 Census , and the second largest city in the Ural Federal District , after Yekaterinburg . Located in the northeast of the oblast , south of Yekaterinburg , the city is just to the east of the Ural Mountains . It sits on the Miass River , part of the border between Europe and Asia .",
      "The area of Chelyabinsk contained the ancient settlement of Arkaim , which belonged to the Sintashta culture . In 1736 , a fortress by the name of Chelyaba was founded on the site of a Bashkir village . Chelyabinsk was granted town status by 1787 . Chelyabinsk began to grow rapidly by the early 20th century as a result of the construction of railway links to European Russia and Siberia , including the Trans-Siberian Railway . Its population reached 70,000 by 1917 . Under the Soviet Union , Chelyabinsk became a major industrial centre during the 1930s . The Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant was built in 1933 . During World War II , the city was a major contributor to the manufacture of tanks and ammunition .",
      "Chelyabinsk remains an important industrial centre , especially heavy industries such as metallurgy and military production . It is home to several educational institutions , mainly South Ural State University and Chelyabinsk State University . In 2013 , the Chelyabinsk meteor exploded over the Ural Mountains , with fragments falling into and near the city . The blast of the explosion caused many hundreds of injuries , some of them serious , mostly caused by glass fragments from shattered windows . The Chelyabinsk Regional Museum contains fragments of the meteorite .",
      "History .",
      "Ancient Sintashta civilization .",
      "Archaeologists have discovered ruins of the ancient town of Arkaim in the vicinity of the city of Chelyabinsk . Ruins and artifacts in Arkaim and other sites in the region indicate a relatively advanced civilization existing in the area since the 2nd millennium BCE , which was of proto-Indo-Iranian origin .",
      "The Arkaim site , located in the Sintashta-Petrovka cultural area , was known by Russian archaeologists for at least 70 years , however it was mostly ignored by non-Russian anthropological circles . The borders of the Sintashta-Petrovka cultural area run along the eastern Urals of the Eurasian steppe to about 400 km south of Chelyabinsk and to the east for about 200 km . 23 archaeological sites are recognized as being part of this area .",
      "The sites resemble towns , laid out in round , square , or oval shapes . Although most of the sites have been discovered by aerial photography , only two , Arkaim and Sintashta , have been thoroughly excavated . These sites are characterized by their fortification , connected houses , and extensive evidence of metallurgy .",
      "The people of the Sintashta culture are thought to have spoken Proto-Indo-Iranian , the ancestor of the Indo-Iranian language family . This identification is based primarily on similarities between their language in comparison to sections of the Rigveda , and based on funerary rituals of the Sintashta culture , as revealed by archaeological studies in the area .",
      "Modern Russian history .",
      "The fortress of Chelyaba , from which the city takes its name , was founded at the location of the Bashkir village of Chelyaby ( ) by colonel Alexey ( Kutlu-Muhammed ) Tevkelev in 1736 to protect the surrounding trade routes from possible attacks by Bashkir outlaws . During Pugachevs Rebellion , the fortress withstood a siege by the rebel forces in 1774 , but was eventually captured for several months in 1775 . In 1782 , Chelyabinsk became a seat of the uyezd of Ufa Viceroyalty , which was later reformed into Orenburg Governorate . In 1787 , Chelyabinsk was granted town status by the government .",
      "Until the late 19th century , Chelyabinsk was a small provincial town . In 1892 , the Samara-Zlatoust Railway was completed , which connected it with Moscow and the rest of European Russia . Also in 1892 , construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway started from Chelyabinsk , and in 1896 , the city was linked to Ekaterinburg . Chelyabinsk then became the main hub for travel to Siberia . For fifteen years , more than fifteen million people - a tenth of Russias population at the time - passed through Chelyabinsk . Some of them remained in Chelyabinsk , which contributed to its rapid growth . In addition a so-called \u201ccustoms fracture\u201d was created in Chelyabinsk , which imposed duties on the shipment of goods between the European and Asian parts of Russia , which led to the emergence of mills and notably , a tea-packing factory . As a result , Chelyabinsk became a major trade center . Its population reached 20,000 inhabitants by 1897 , 45,000 by 1913 , and 70,000 by 1917 . Because of its rapid growth at the turn of the 20th century , similar to that of midwestern American cities , Chelyabinsk was sometimes called the Chicago of the Urals .",
      "During the first Five-Year Plans of the 1930s , Chelyabinsk experienced rapid industrial growth . Several important factories , including the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant , were built at this time . During World War II , Joseph Stalin decided to move a large part of Soviet manufacturing to areas removed from the reach of the advancing German military as part of a general exodus from western occupied areas . This brought new industries and thousands of workers to Chelyabinsk , including facilities for the production of T-34 tanks and Katyusha rocket launchers . During World War II , the citys industries produced 18,000 tanks and 48,500 tank diesel engines as well as over 17 million units of ammunition . During that time Chelyabinsk was informally called \u201cTankograd\u201d ( English : \u201cTank City\u201d ) . During World War II , the S.M . Kirov Factory no . 185 or \u201cOKMO\u201d was moved to Chelyabinsk from Leningrad to produce heavy tanks , although it was transferred to Omsk after 1962 .",
      "2013 meteor .",
      "Shortly after dawn on February 15 , 2013 , a superbolide meteor descended at over over the Ural Mountains , exploding at an altitude of .",
      "The meteor created a momentary flash as bright as the sun and generated a shock wave that injured over a thousand people . Fragments fell in and around Chelyabinsk . Interior Ministry spokesman Vadim Kolesnikov said 1,100 people had called for medical assistance following the incident , mostly for treatment of injuries from broken glass by the explosions . One woman suffered a broken spine . Kolesnikov also said about of a roof at a zinc factory had collapsed . A spokeswoman for the Emergency Ministry told the Associated Press that there was a meteor shower ; however , another ministry spokeswoman was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying it was a single meteor . The size has been estimated at diameter with a mass of 10,000 or 11,000 metric tons . The power of the explosion was about 500 kilotons of TNT ( about 1.8 PJ ) , which is 20\u201330 times more energy than was released from the atomic bomb detonated in Hiroshima . The city managed to avoid large casualties and destruction due to the high altitude of the explosion .",

      "Svatopluk Pluskal ( 28 October 1930 \u2013 29 May 2005 ) was a Czechoslovak footballer and holder of a silver medal from the World Cup in Chile in 1962 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Svatopluk Pluskal started playing football in his home town , where he played for several clubs . With ( Ba\u0165a Zl\u00edn \u2013 Svit Gottwaldov ) he achieved promotion to the top league . He achieved individual success when he was selected for the junior international team . He was able to play in most positions , but in Zl\u00edn he played mainly as a striker .",
      "Pre-International Career .",
      "In 1951 he moved to Prague where he became an important player for a newly founded army football club ( ATK , later called \u00daDA and Dukla Prague ) , for whom he played mainly as a defensive midfielder . In almost 16 years with this club , he was 8-time champion of the league but he achieved his most important successes at the club level in the United States . Dukla Praha with Pluskal in its line-up won the American Cup ( a tournament of teams from football-developed countries ) three times in a row in the first half of the 1960s . In 1962 Pluskal scored the winning goal in the final against Brazilian team FC America .",
      "International career .",
      "He played in the Czechoslovak international team from 1952 ( starting as a defender ) and played in three World Cups . In 1954 he took part in the record 0\u20135 defeat by Austria in Switzerland . Four years later , at the 1958 world cup finals , Pluskal played in more games . Losing 1\u20130 to Northern Ireland , drawing 2\u20132 with West Germany , and scoring a remarkable 6\u20131 victory over Argentina , under modern rules they would have gone through . Under the rules of the time , having equal points , a play-off had to decide , and Northern Ireland beat them for the second time , this time 2\u20131 after extra time .",
      "In the 1962 World Cup in Chile , Pluskal was a member of the line-up . With his teammate from Dukla , Josef Masopust , he formed the key midfield of the 4\u20132\u20134 formation . Thanks to Pluskal , the team that had had to qualify for the Championships in a playoff with Scotland had got to the World Cup final . There it was beaten by Brazil . In 1965 , Pluskal played in the unsuccessful qualification campaign for the World Cup in England , but with this his international career ended . He played 56 matches in Czechoslovak colours and scored one goal .",
      "Thanks to his important contribution to the success in Chile , Pluskal received recognition on the international stage . On 23 October 1963 , he was a member of the Rest of the World team that took on England at Wembley in front of 100,000 fans , to celebrate 100 years of English football . A year later , he played for the Europe team in Belgrade against Yugoslavia , and appeared for Europe again in 1965 against Great Britain .",
      "Pluskals career was ended by a knee injury in 1967 . In the league he played 282 matches and scored 37 goals . He was a universal footballer , a good header of the ball , and he was famous for his slide tackles , with which he cleanly took the ball from his opponents . Although players often protested against this style of play , referees usually considered it to be within the rules . During his football career , this tireless fighter became an impenetrable shield , able to concentrate on what was needed . Off the field , he helped the team with his easy humour .",
      "Late life .",
      "As with many other former players , Pluskal became a coach . He did this job for Plze\u0148 clubs \u0160koda and Slovan , later on for FC Bohemians Praha and for a few years in Enosis Neon Paralimni of Cyprus . He helped Bohemians with their promotion to the First Division .",
      "After a brain stroke Pluskal was confined to bed . He died at the age of 74 .",

      "Fort Tilden",
      "Fort Tilden , also known as Fort Tilden Historic District , is a former United States Army installation on the coast in the New York City borough of Queens . Fort Tilden now forms part of the Gateway National Recreation Area , and is administered by the National Park Service .",
      "Fort Tilden Historic District is located on the Rockaway Peninsula , between Jacob Riis Park to the east and Breezy Point Tip to the west . All three of these sites are operated by the National Park Service .",
      "Since its decommissioning , the former installation has largely become a natural area of beach , dunes and maritime forest . Most of the old military installations are abandoned , and military structures which formerly housed artillery ( batteries ) and ammunition ( magazines ) are covered in graffiti . A few buildings have been renovated and are used by local arts groups , and some large open areas are used as sports grounds . Atop one of the old batteries , Battery Harris East , a viewing platform has 360-degree views , which include the city , New York Harbor , and the Atlantic Ocean . The wilder parts of Fort Tilden are popular with bird-watchers and other nature-lovers , and the beach areas are frequently used for fishing .",
      "Military history .",
      "The fort first served as a coast artillery installation and ended its service as a Nike Hercules and Nike Ajax missile site . However , the historic gun batteries and other military fortifications remain closed to the public . Some of these structures are very hazardous .",
      "World War I .",
      "The fort was established as Camp Rockaway Beach shortly after the United States entered World War I in April 1917 . Several temporary military installations had been built at or near the site since the War of 1812 against the British . It was named after Samuel J . Tilden , one-term Governor of New York State and Democratic Presidential candidate in 1876 .",
      "An unnamed battery from the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps was the first unit deployed to the fort . This battery had four 12-inch coast defense mortars , and was soon joined by two batteries of two 6-inch M1900 guns on pedestal mounts , Battery Kessler and Battery East ( renamed Battery Fergusson in 1939 ) . The mortars were taken from Battery Piper at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn , and the six-inch guns were brought in from Battery Burke at Fort Hamilton and Battery Kinney at Fort Slocum on Davids Island . However , as the mortars were sited adjacent to Naval Air Station Rockaway there were concerns that when fired they could potentially cause damage to the installation . In 1919-1920 the fixed mounts were replaced with railway mortars that could be moved away from the air station for firing . In 1918-1919 a battery of two 3-inch antiaircraft guns was installed at the fort .",
      "The facility became part of the Harbor Defenses of Southern New York , joining Fort Hamilton and Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island . The railway mortars and their tracks were probably removed in 1921 to make room for Battery Harris .",
      "Inter-war period .",
      "In March 1921 the city of New York would become one of the first locations in the United States to be defended by 16-inch M1919 guns ; these were the most powerful weapon in the United States arsenal when construction began on Battery Harris . The coastal artillery installation became operational in December 1924 . Its two guns were originally mounted in the open ; ammunition was delivered on a railway system . This had evolved from its initial design as one of the first dispersed batteries ; the two unprotected guns were spaced at , about twice the of earlier batteries for 12-inch guns . As the dispersed battery concept was improved , the spacing at later works increased to and finally at Fort Story . The battery was named for Henry Leavenworth Harris , a career Army officer who died in 1920 .",
      "World War II .",
      "In 1941-42 a massive concrete casemate was built to enclose the guns at Battery Harris . The bunker , which was constructed to provide protection against air attack , also contained ammunition magazines and the fire control system . Fort Tilden was supplemented during the war with another 16-inch gun battery at the Highlands Military Reservation near Navesink , New Jersey . As both batteries had 16-inch guns , all the older heavy guns defending New York were subsequently removed and scrapped in 1942-44 , except two pairs of long-range 12-inch guns at Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook in New Jersey . Additional 16-inch batteries were proposed for Fort Wadsworth and a location that is now part of JFK Airport , but these were never built .",
      "Several smaller batteries were built in and near Fort Tilden during the war . Battery 220 was completed but not armed ; it was primarily an ammunition bunker for two 6-inch guns that were never delivered . Four Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat ( AMTB ) batteries were built during the war , two each at Norton Point and Rockaway Point ( aka Breezy Point ) . Norton Point had AMTB 18 with four 3-inch M1902 guns and AMTB 19 with four 90 mm dual-purpose guns . The 3-inch guns were all on pedestal mounts ; the 90 mm AMTB batteries were authorized two fixed guns and two towed guns . Rockaway Point had AMTB 20 with two 3-inch M1902 guns and AMTB 21 with four 90 mm guns . All six 3-inch guns for these batteries came from Battery Catlin at Fort Wadsworth , and AMTB 18 was also called Battery New Catlin .",
      "After the war it was determined that gun defenses were obsolete , and Fort Tilden was disarmed , with all guns removed for scrap in 1948 .",
      "Cold War .",
      "In 1950 , as the fear of Soviet air attack grew , a battalion of sixteen 90 mm guns was deployed at Fort Tilden , which was renamed Site NY-43 as part of the United States air defense system . The site remained active until 1954 . An additional four-gun 90 mm battery was in the area 1951-54 , and two four-gun batteries of 120 mm guns were at the fort 1952-55 .",
      "In 1955 the AA guns were replaced by a Nike-Ajax missile site called NY-49 . A photograph shows at least two launch sites with six rails each were at Fort Tilden . These were converted to the nuclear-capable Nike-Hercules missile in 1958 . The Nike-Hercules system was deactivated throughout the US in 1972 .",
      "Army Reserve post .",
      "From the late 1960s until at least 1978 , Fort Tilden was an Army Reserve Post , housing a Signal Corps unit , the 411th Engineer Brigade , and an Army Reserve self-propelled 8 howitzer battalion , originally the 5/51st Field Artillery ( FA ) and renamed in the early 70s the 7/9th FA . From the late 1960s until the 1980s , Fort Tilden served as a United States Army Reserve post , with the 187th Infantry Brigades 5/5th FA ; a towed 105 mm howitzer battalion stationed there until the 187th was deactivated in 1995 . Fort Tilden was also the location of the 411th Engineer Brigade , which was headquartered there from 1968 to 1978 .",
      "Fort Tilden remained an Army installation until the late 1970s , when it was decommissioned and turned over to the National Park Service , and made part of the Gateway National Recreation Area . A number of structures are included in an historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places , including the two concrete casemates for the 16/50 caliber M1919 guns of Battery Harris .",
      "Nature area .",
      "Fort Tilden is an important nesting area for the threatened Piping Plover , a species which NPS\u2014as part of a large global effort\u2014is working to protect . The eggs and chicks are very small and highly camouflaged , so they are extremely difficult to see . It is very easy to step on the eggs and kill the unhatched chicks . Under New York and Federal laws persons may be arrested and fined for killing , harassing , teasing , or in any way disturbing birds nesting in this area . Keep out of areas delineated by string fences and signs .",
      "Common Terns and Least Terns also make their nests on the beach at Fort Tilden . These two species are threatened in New York State as well ."

      "Klamath County , California",
      "Klamath County was a county of California from 1851 to 1874 . During its existence , the county seat moved twice and ultimately portions of the territory it once had were carved up and added to nearby counties . It was formed from the northwestern portion of Trinity County , and originally included all of the northwestern part of the state , from the Mad River in the south to Oregon in the north , from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the middle of what is now Siskiyou County in the east . It is the only county in California to be disestablished .",
      "History .",
      "The original county seat was Trinidad , on the countys southwestern coast . In 1854 the county seat was moved to Crescent City , because of its larger population . But the western portion of the county was unrepresentative of the mining interests in the eastern portion of the county , and so , in 1856 , the county seat was moved inland , to Orleans Bar , now Orleans . In 1857 , Del Norte County , including Crescent City , was split off from Klamath County .",
      "The countys economy was never healthy after the gold rush . The area was contested with Native American tribes . The Klamath and Salmon River Indian War and the 1858-1864 Bald Hills War involved white vigilantes hunting down and killing most adult males and killing , capturing , or enslaving women and children . Many of the captive natives subsequently died of starvation and exposure at Fort Humboldt . The white settlers economy suffered from the effects of the Indian wars , which disrupted the supplies to the settlements from the coastal towns . Worse still was the devastating effects of the Great Flood of 1862 which swept away the riverside settlements , mining works and ferries . In 1874 Klamath County was finally abolished , divided between Siskiyou and Humboldt counties . The official reason for dissolving of Klamath County was its electoral corruption . In one election there were many more votes tallied than voters . Present day Del Norte County occupies part of Klamath County .",

      "In Greece , the Council of State ( ) is the Supreme Administrative Court of Greece .",
      "Organization .",
      "The Council is headed by its president , who is chosen from among the members of the Council by the Cabinet of Greece for a term of four years . The court comprises the presiding board ( the President and 7 Vice-presidents ) , 42 Privy Councillors , 48 Associate Judges and 50 Reporting Judges , all graduates of the National School of Judges .",
      "The Council is seated in the Arsakeion building in the centre of Athens .",
      "The Council executes its jurisdiction in Plenary Session or in six Chambers-Judicial Formations ( \u0391 , \u0392 , \u0393 , \u0394 , \u0395 and \u03a3\u03a4 ) . Each Chamber may have two compositions : five-member or seven-member . The jurisdiction of the Plenary Session is determined by the law ( Legislative Decree 170/1973 , Article 14 ) , while the competence of the Chambers is determined by the law and the presidential decrees , proposed by the Minister of Justice after an opinion of the Council .",
      "After the Constitutional Amendment of 2001 the Plenary Session ( and not the Chambers ) is the only competent to judge the constitutionality of laws . The Plenary Session is , also , competent : a ) for cases of general interest that the President introduces directly into it , b ) for cases that one of the Chambers submits to it . These cases are submitted by the Chambers to the Plenary Session for two reasons : either because they are cases of general interest or because the applicable legislative provision is judged unconstitutional .",
      "History .",
      "The Council was first founded in 1835 and it constituted an imitation of the French Conseil d\u00c9tat . It had advisory competence with respect to the draft decrees and administrative jurisdiction , issuing irrevocable decisions . The Council was suppressed by the Constitution of 1844 ( article 102 ) . Following the deposing of King Otto in 1862 , the National Assembly that was convened decided to re-establish the Council in order to prepare and deliberate on law proposals .",
      "The new 1864 Constitution provided for a revision of this in the forthcoming parliamentary session , provided that a 3/4 majority voted against it . On 25 November 1865 a law was passed that abolished the Council of State again .",
      "Although the Constitution of 1911 provided for its re-establishment , it was not refounded until 1928 ( Law 3713/1928 as it has been repeatedly revised ) , after the adoption of the Constitution of 1927 ( articles 102-105 ) . Its first president , from 1928 until 1935 , was Konstantinos Raktivan . Its jurisdiction and composition is now provided for in the Constitution of 1975/1985/2001 ( article 95 ) , the Law 170/1973 ( as revised ) and the Presidential Decree 18/1989 .",
      "Administrative competence .",
      "The administrative competence of the Council , as one of the three Big Bodies of the Public Administration ( the other two are the Chamber of Accounts and the Hellenic Legal Council ) is regulated by the article 95 of the Constitution of 1974/1985/2001 and consists in the elaboration of all the regulative decrees , namely of all the decrees that include impersonal ( nor referring to a particular person ) legal rules .",
      "Competent for this elaboration is the fifth ( \u0395 ) Chamber of the Council , composed , for such cases , of three or five members . The Chamber may , at its option , submit the case to the nine member Plenary Session . The submission is obligatory for the Chamber , when the constitutionality of the relevant to the decree legal provisions is judged ( article 100 of the Constitution after the Amendment of 2001 ) .",
      "The Administration is obliged to send the regulative decrees to the Conseil for elaboration but it is not obliged to follow the consultory response of the Council . Nonetheless , the Administration usually abides by the Councils opinion .",
      "A promulgated regulative decree , if not sent to the Council for elaboration before its promulgation , shall be annulled , if a recourse ( writ of annulment ) is submitted to the competent court ( the Conseil d Etat or the Administrative Court of Appeals ) .",
      "The elaboration of the decrees by the Council is limited to the lato sensu legality ( and the constitutionality of the relevant legal provisions ) of the decrees , while the respective control of the French Conseil d\u00c9tat goes to the substance of the context of the elaborated decree .",
      "Litigation .",
      "The Council is the head of the system of administrative justice and it constitutes the Supreme Administrative Court . A case is introduced into the Council with the following legal means or remedies :",
      "- the recourse ( \u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b1\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 ; the accurate translation is writ of annulment ) , with which the annulment of an administrative act is pursued . The Council judges only the legal aspects of the case and not the true facts . Its decision includes a judgement about legality and not a control upon the merits .",
      "- the writ of certiorari ( \u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 ) against the decisions of the lower administrative courts ( Administrative Courts of First Instance and Administrative Courts of Appeals ) , which judge recourses ( \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u03ad\u03c2 ) and their decisions include a control upon the merits . The writ of certiorari is constitutionally consolidated ( article 95 of the Constitution 1975/1986/2001 ) and places the Council at the top of the administrative branch of justice , because it has the last word in the legal aspects of every administrative litigation .",
      "- the clerical recourse , with which disputes between the State and the civil servants are introduced into the Council . The decision of the Council includes a judgement both about the legality and upon the merits of the case .",
      "- the appeal against the decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeals , which judges at first instance certain writs of annulment ( according to the provisions of the Law 702/1977 ) . In this case , the Council judges as a court of appeals and the Administrative Court of Appeals as a court of first instance .",
      "Acts of government .",
      "Following the jurisprudence of the French Conseil d\u00c9tat , the Council refuses to examine the legality of certain administrative acts , which are called acts of government . The Council includes in this limited category :",
      "- acts regulating the relationships between the executive branch and the Parliament , such as the dissolution of the Parliament or the act proclaiming a referendum .",
      "- acts connected with the foreign policy of Greece , such as international conventions , acts promulgated for the application of international treaties , acts relevant to the diplomatic protection of Greek citizens abroad etc .",
      "- the declaration of mobilisation .",
      "- the granting of pardons .",
      "Procedure .",
      "The procedure is based on the principles of the inquisitorial system and of the initiative of the litigant . According to this last principle the litigant is responsible for the commencement of the procedure .",
      "International relations .",
      "The Council of State is a founding member of the International Association of Supreme Administrative Courts and , since Greece\u2019s accession to the European Union , of the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union .

      "British Vogue is a British fashion magazine published based in London since autumn 1916 . It is the British edition of the American magazine Vogue and is owned and distributed by Cond\u00e9 Nast . British Vogue editor in 2012 claimed that , Vogue power is universally acknowledged . Its the place everybody wants to be if they want to be in the world of fashion and 85% of the magazines readers agree that Vogue is the Fashion Bible . The magazine is considered to be one that links fashion to high society and class , teaching its readers how to assume a distinctively chic and modern appearance .",
      "British Vogue is a magazine whose success is based upon its advertising rather than its sales revenue . In 2007 , it ran 2,020 pages of advertising at an average of \u00a316,000 a page . It is deemed to be more commercial than other editions of Vogue . British Vogue is the most profitable British magazine as well as the most profitable edition of Vogue besides the US and China editions .",
      "History .",
      "During the First World War , Cond\u00e9 Nast , Vogues publisher , had to deal with restrictions on overseas shipping as well as paper shortages in America . The British edition of Vogue was the answer to this problem , providing Vogue fashion coverage in the British Isles when it was not practicable to receive it in the usual way . Under the London editions second editor , Elspeth Champcommunal , the magazine was essentially the same as the American edition , except for its British English spellings . However , Champcommunal thought it important that Vogue be more than a fashion magazine . It featured articles on society and sporting news.. . Health and beauty advice.. . travelogues.. . and editorials , making it a skillfully mixed cocktail . Champcommunal held her editorial position until 1922 .",
      "Under its next editor , Dorothy Todd , a renowned Vogue editor due to her boldness , especially in her movement to blend the arts and fashion , the magazine shifted its focus from fashion to literature , featuring articles from Clive Bell about art exhibitions in Paris . There were also notable features from noted English writers such as Virginia Woolf and Aldous Huxley . Due to Todds changes , the magazine lost much of its audience , and she spent only four years as editor . British Vogue is not believed to have really taken off until after its third editor , Alison Settle , was appointed in 1926 .",
      "Under Audrey Withers ( editor from 1940 to 1960 ) , the magazine again took a literary direction , and during the Second World War it even took part in reporting the war . In 1944 , the American photographer Lee Miller persuaded Withers to send her to Normandy to produce an article on wartime nursing ; Miller then followed the Allied advance through Europe , reporting the liberation of Paris and sending a story from Buchenwald . Dame Anna Wintour edited the British edition from 1985 to 1987 , before taking over Vogue in New York City .",
      "Alexandra Shulman was Editor-in-Chief of the magazine from 1992 to 2017 . When Shulman was editor , the magazine drew more than a million readers . Shulman was known for developing collectors issues of British Vogue , such as the Gold Millennium Issue where celebrities and supermodels such as Kate Moss featured on the cover . Shulman was also praised for her use of up and coming photographers like Mario Testino . Shulman became known for her attempt to change the face of fashion . She pushed designers to stop using size-zero models . In 2016 , Shulman collaborated with photographer Josh Olins to shoot Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge on the cover of Vogues centenary issue . The photographs were subsequently featured in the National Portrait Gallery , London The magazine under Shulman was the subject of Richard Macers behind-the-scenes BBC documentary , Absolutely Fashion : Inside British Vogue ( 2016 ) .",
      "Edward Enninful was confirmed as the new editor-in-chief of British Vogue on 10 April 2017 . Cond\u00e9 Nast International Chairman and CEO Jonathan Newhouse announced him as the successor to Alexandra Shulman , calling Enninful an influential figure in the communities of fashion , Hollywood and music which shape the cultural zeitgeist , adding that by virtue of his talent and experience , Edward is supremely prepared to assume the responsibility of British Vogue . Enninfuls first issue as editor-in-chief was 2017s December issue , featuring British model and activist Adwoa Aboah on the cover . In September 2019 , Enninful collaborated with Meghan , Duchess of Sussex on the September issue . The issue highlights Forces for Change , and features on the cover 15 activists including actress Salma Hayek and interviews with former US First Lady Michelle Obama . The magazines September 2020 triple gatefold cover featured pictures of 20 activists often associated with the Black Lives Matter movement , including Marcus Rashford and Adwoa Aboah . The Activism Now edition was photographed by Misan Harriman and was the first British Vogue cover taken by a black man in the magazines 104-year history ( Nadine Ijewere was the first black female to take a cover photograph ) .",
      "Criticism .",
      "There has been an ongoing debate about whether or not the fashion industry is racist , and with the arrest of British designer John Galliano , who was found guilty of making racist and anti-Semitic comments in a public setting , as well as the news the hairdresser James Brown , who has worked closely with Kate Moss , went on a rant where he used the N word , more attention has been brought to the issue .",
      "British Vogue also faces some criticisms for fashion blunders . In 2011 , the magazine was criticised for a spread in the December 2011 issue which featured a rosy-cheeked model sitting atop a yak , sporting a pair of \u00a35,820 trousers said to make the model look like the animal ."

      "Pakistan Football Federation ( PFF ) was the govenrning body of association football in Pakistan . PFF was formed in 1954 . It is the governing body of Football in Pakistan . It organizes the Pakistan national teams matches as well as the domestic leagues and cups . The PFFs headquarter is at FIFA Football House in Lahore , Punjab near the Punjab Stadium . PFF is currently suspended by FIFA due to third party interference .",
      "Overview .",
      "The PFF governs all football clubs in Pakistan . It is a member of AFC and FIFA . All of Pakistans football clubs must be members of the PFF . The PFF is responsible for the appointment of the management of the Pakistan mens and womens national teams and the organization of the Pakistan Premier League ( the top division ) , and other lower divisions . The game is controlled at the local level , by 8 provincial football federations affiliated to The PFF but with responsibilities for organising and running football activities in their area like Islamabad football association .",
      "History .",
      "On 5 December 1947 , after the independence from Great Britain , the Pakistan Football Federation was created . Mohammad Ali Jinnah , Pakistans first leader , became the Patron-in-Chief , and in 1948 , the PFF became affiliated with FIFA . It is also one of the founding members of the Asian Football Confederation when it was established in 1954 .",
      "It organized the first national championship in 1948 at Karachi .",
      "Previously , corrupt and inefficient management , poor support from the authorities to the players and to the game itself , poor media coverage and the status of Cricket as the most popular game in the country were some of the factors as to why football remained underdeveloped since independence . Also due to politics within the organisation , there was a time when FIFA had suspended Pakistan from all international football due to rival PFF factions setting up their own teams to take part in international and national competitions . Such things hindered any chance of footballs progress over the last 2 decades .",
      "However , in August 2003 , the PFF was under new management , as Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat took over , and he has turned around the fortunes of Pakistani football . With the Assistance of FIFA , the PFF set up a national football league in 2004 , which is now called the Pakistan Premier League . In 2005 a national championship was set up for womens football . In 2007 , the inter-city Geo Super Football League was established , making it the first time that Pakistani club football was telecast live on national television via GEO Super . It also became Pakistans first professional football tournament .",
      "Since 2015 and the controversial third election of Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat , the PFF has been going through an internal feud that unabled the local and national teams to partake to any international event . In July 2017 , the FIFA threatened to suspend the PFFs membership if it kept refusing to hand football affairs to its president-elect Faisal Saleh Hayat . Former coach Nasir Ismail asked FIFA to hold fresh elections for the PFFs presidency .",
      "On 11 October 2017 the FIFA decided to suspend Pakistan Football Federation ( PFF ) with immediate effect On 13 March 2018 FIFA lifted the suspension",
      "Overview .",
      "At both club and international football , Pakistan have seen results improve . Pakistan rise has attracted many Pakistani players throughout the world such as England based player Zesh Rehman . However more effort and sincerity by the officials is required to allow further progress of the sport in Pakistan . Current bureaucratic inefficiencies and lackluster politics remain within the PFF machinery that have always hindered the true growth of the game in Pakistan at a faster rate .",
      "Pakistans core national league has three divisions . The National Football Championship ( A-Division ) is named as the Pakistan Premier League ( PPL ) while National Championship ( B-Division ) is known as the Pakistan Football Federation League ( PFF league ) and the National Club Championship ( C-Division ) is the lowest division . Below this are regional leagues likes IFA in Islamabad . There is also a national knock-out competition called the National Football Challenge Cup although it appears to be used sparingly nowadays , as PFF is one of the most corrupt organizations , per UNESCO corruption rankings .",
      "Criticism .",
      "Over the past several years , the Pakistan Football Federation has been accused of several corruption scandals and incompetence in running the day-to-day footballing activities in Pakistan . Local media outlets have described the current situation of the PFF as a horror show .",
      "Faisal Saleh Hayat incompetence .",
      "Hayat was the President of the Pakistan Football Federation and also serves as a member of the Strategic Committee of FIFA . He has held this position since 2003 , and has been described as a feudal lord of Pakistani football . During his controversial tenure , Pakistans FIFA ranking has dropped from 168 in 2003 to 201 in 2017 . Despite his lackluster results , Hayat continues to hold on to his position as president . Hayat himself in also the middle of various corruption allegations involving PFF and a legal battle at Lahore High Court with a warring faction intent on seeing him removed from office . The top division of the Pakistan Premier League remains suspended because the crisis created due to his actions . The mens senior team last played in March 2015 , when they bowed out of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in the first round .",
      "In June 2017 , 18 of the 26 members of the PFF voted in favor of Faisal Saleh Hayats dismissal for incompetence and embezzlement of PFF funds . In July 2017 , the FIFA threatened to suspend the PFFs membership if it kept refusing to hand football affairs to its president-elect Faisal Saleh Hayat .",
      "Punjab Football Association Elections Controversy .",
      "In June 2015 , the PFF presidential elections were announced , with Faisal Saleh Hayat facing his biggest challenge since 2003 . Several senior members of the PFF as well as the government were intent on having Hayat removed from power . Controversy began at the Punjab Football Association , when the Hayat-backed Sardar Naveed Haider Khan toppled incumbent Arshad Khan Lodhi . Several of Lodhis voters were banned by Hayats illegal disciplinary committee . With this , Zahir Ali Shah a PFF vice-president , turned against Hayat and announced his intention to run for PFF presidency . Shortly after his announcement , allegations emerged from Shah claiming that Hayat had changed several clauses of the PFF constitution to suit himself in the presidential election . The PFF eventually split into two groups following an Extraordinary Congress meeting that suspended Hayat . With the election approaching , the two factions announced their own election venues . The Lahore High Court was forced to intervene in and ordered a stay on polling and appointed a temporary administrator until matters were resolved between the two factions .",
      "The row intensified when the Hayat faction went on and held election anyway , disobeying the Lahore High Court stay order . FIFA then intervened and sent a fact-finding mission . They concluded that Hayat be given a mandate for two years , in which he would have to amend PFF statutes and form an independent disciplinary committee before holding elections again .",
      "The Lahore High Court appointed administrator Asad Munir was given authority to manage football activity in Pakistan , while the two factions sorted out differences . In a shocking move , the Hayat faction swiftly withdrew Pakistan team from the 2015 SAFF Cup , only causing more resentment from football fans and senior PFF members who were intent on seeing Hayat removed from office . Many suggest that Faisal Saleh Hayat is not mentally stable .",
      "In October 2016 , the FIFA executive committee indicated all is not well with the Faisal Saleh Hayat faction of the PFF . A FIFA spokesperson said given the current situation , FIFA has been withholding development funding to PFF .",
      "In February 2017 , the Lahore High Court restored Faisal Saleh Hayat as president of the Pakistan Football Federation . The FIFA Executive Committee decided that the current PFF leadership - led by Faisal Saleh Hayat - would be given two years ( until September 2017 ) to revise the PFF statutes and organise elections accordingly .",
      "Crisis .",
      "2015 crisis .",
      "Just before PPF elections in 2015 , two groups were formed within the federation and there infighting in the federation due to which FIFA took notice and told the federation to solve the matters , being in contact with AFC . Upon the situation a FIFA spokesman said ,",
      "Lahore High Court ( LHC ) declared PFF elections to be held on 30 June 2015 .",
      "On 30 June , the elections were declared null/void by LHC , attended by AFC observer , Sanjeevan Balasinggam . The PFF chairman Faisal Saleh Hayat said that the Elections were approved by AFC , but the Asian governing body had no comment on the situation .",
      "Due to crisis Pakistan has not qualified for any of the international tournament since March 2015 and FIFA rankings have slumped to 198 for mens team .",
      "A normalization committee was made for the Pakistan Football Federation ( PFF ) whose task is to hold elections of the countrys football governing body and bring it would bring an end to a four-year crisis that resulted in Pakistan suffering significantly in the game .",
      "2021 crisis .",
      "On 27 March 2021 , the PFFs office was attacked and people inside held hostage by its former president , Syed Ashfaq Hussain Shah , and his group , and the ongoing womens championship was cancelled . Major clubs protested : Diya W.F.C . announced following laws laid down by FIFA , PFF NC and the AFC , Mohsin Gillani W.F.C . announced it pulled out and Karachi United condemned actions taken against the NC and stated to be fully and respectfully supportive of following due process as per FIFA directives .",
      "Suspensions .",
      "FIFA has gave warnings and suspension for PFA on several occasions . FIFA had issued a warning to suspend Pakistan if the third party interference ( i.e . involvement of Lahore High Court is not ended as soon as possible .",
      "On 10 October 2017 , FIFA suspended PFF with immediate effect . FIFA stated on its website ,",
      "meaning Pakistan will not be a part of any footballing activity officially until further notice is provided by the governing body .",
      "In 2018 , the ban was lifted by FIFA and Pakistan has been given the opportunity to participate in the 2018 Asian games and the 2018 SAFF competitions .",
      "On 7 April 2021 , FIFA suspended the federation with immediate effect due to third-party interference , which constitutes a serious violation of the FIFA Statutes .",

A regular feature was a memory round : Plomley read a short piece , usually of verse or song lyrics , then read it again later on in the show with funny alterations which the teams scored points for correcting .

      "Chemnitz ( , from 1953 to 1990 : Karl-Marx-Stadt , ; Czech : Sask\u00e1 Kamenice ) is the third largest city in the German federal state of Saxony after Leipzig and Dresden . It is the 28th largest city of Germany as well as the fourth largest city in the area of former East Germany after ( East ) Berlin , Leipzig and Dresden . The city is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region , and lies in the middle of a string of cities sitting in the densely populated northern foreland of the Elster and Ore Mountains , stretching from Plauen in the southwest via Zwickau , Chemnitz and Freiberg to Dresden in the northeast .",
      "Located in the Ore Mountain Basin , the city is surrounded by the Ore Mountains to the south and the Central Saxon Hill Country to the north . The city stands on the Chemnitz River ( progression : ) , which is formed through the confluence of the rivers Zw\u00f6nitz and W\u00fcrschnitz in the borough of Altchemnitz .",
      "The name of the city as well as the names of the rivers are of Slavic origin . Chemnitz is the third largest city in the Thuringian-Upper Saxon dialect area after Leipzig and Dresden . The citys economy is based on the service sector and manufacturing industry . Chemnitz University of Technology has around 10,000 students .",
      "Chemnitz will be the European Capital of Culture of 2025 .",
      "Etymology .",
      "Chemnitz is named after the river Chemnitz , a small tributary of the Zwickau Mulde . The word Chemnitz is from the Sorbian language ( ) , and means stony [ brook ] . The word is composed of the Slavic word meaning stone and the feminine suffix .",
      "It is known in Czech as and in Polish as . There are many other towns named Kamienica or Kamenice in areas with past or present Slavic settlement .",
      "History .",
      "An early Slavic tribes settlement was located at , and the first documented use of the name Chemnitz was the 1143 site of a Benedictine monastery around which a settlement grew . Around 1170 , Frederick I , Holy Roman Emperor granted it the rights of an imperial city . In 1307 , the town became subordinate to the Margraviate of Meissen , the predecessor of the Saxon state . In medieval times , Chemnitz became a centre of textile production and trade . More than one third of the population worked in textile production .",
      "Geologist Georgius Agricola ( 1494-1555 ) , author of several significant works on mining and metallurgy including the landmark treatise De Re Metallica , became city physician of Chemnitz in 1533 and lived here until his death in 1555 . In 1546 he was elected a Burgher of Chemnitz and in the same year also was appointed Burgomaster ( lord mayor ) , serving again in 1547 , 1551 , and 1553 . In spite of having been a leading citizen of the city , when Agricola died in 1555 the Protestant Duke denied him burial in the citys cathedral due to Agricolas allegiance to his Roman Catholic faith . Agricolas friends arranged for his remains to be buried in more sympathetic Zeitz , approximately 50 km away .",
      "By the early 19th century , Chemnitz had become an industrial centre ( sometimes called the Saxon Manchester , , ) . In 1913 , Chemnitz had a population of 320,000 and , like Leipzig and Dresden , was larger at that time than today . After losing inhabitants due to the First World War Chemnitz grew rapidly again and reached its all-time peak of 360,250 inhabitants in 1930 . Thereafter , growth was stalled by the world economic crisis .",
      "Weimar Republic .",
      "As a working-class industrial city , it was a powerful center of socialist political organization after World War I . At the foundation of the German Communist Party the local Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany voted by 1,000 votes to three to break from the party and join the Communist Party behind their local leaders , Fritz Heckert and Heinrich Brandler . In March 1919 the German Communist Party had over 10,000 members in the",

      "World War II .",
      "Allied bombing destroyed 41 per cent of the built-up area of Chemnitz during the Second World War . Chemnitz contained factories that produced military hardware and a Flossenb\u00fcrg forced labor subcamp ( 500 female inmates ) for Astra-Werke AG . The oil refinery was a target for bombers during the Oil Campaign of World War II , and Operation Thunderclap attacks included the following raids :",
      "- 14/15 February 1945 : The first major raid on Chemnitz used 717 RAF bombers , but due to cloud cover most bombs fell over open countryside .",
      "- 2/3\u20135 March : USAAF bombers attacked the marshalling yards .",
      "- 5 March : 760 RAF bombers attacked .",
      "The headquarters of the auto manufacturer Auto Union were also based in Chemnitz since 1932 and its buildings were also badly damaged . At the end of the war , the companys executives fled and relocated the company in Ingolstadt , Bavaria , where it evolved into Audi , now a brand within the Volkswagen group .",
      "The World War II bombings left most of the city in ruins and post-war , the East German reconstruction included large low rise ( and later high-rise ) housing . Some tourist sites were reconstructed during the East German era and after German reunification . The city was occupied by Soviet troops on 8 May 1945 .",
      "GDR .",
      "After the dissolution of the L\u00e4nder ( states ) in the GDR in 1952 , Chemnitz became seat of a district ( ) . On 10 May 1953 , the city was renamed by decision of the East German government to after Karl Marx , in recognition of its industrial heritage and the Karl Marx Year marking the 135th anniversary of his birth and the 70th anniversary of his death . GDR Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl said :",
      "After the city centre was destroyed in World War II , the East German authorities attempted to rebuild it to symbolise the conceptions of urban development of a socialist city . The layout of the city centre at that time was rejected in favour of a new road network . However , the original plans were not completed . In addition , the rapid development of housing took priority over the preservation of old buildings . So in the 1960s and 1970s , both in the centre as well as the periphery , large areas were built in apartment-block style , for example . The old buildings of the period , which still existed in the Kassberg , and especially , were neglected and fell increasingly into dereliction .",
      "After reunification .",
      "On 23 April 1990 , a referendum on the future name of the city was held : 76% of the voters voted for the old name . On 1 June 1990 , the city was officially renamed .",
      "After the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990 , the city of Chemnitz faced several difficult tasks . Many inhabitants migrated to the former West Germany and unemployment in the region increased sharply ; in addition Chemnitz did not have adequate shopping facilities , but this was increasingly demanded . Large shopping centers were constructed on the city periphery to the early 1990s .",
      "Chemnitz is the only major German city whose centre was re-planned after 1990 , similar to the reconstruction of several other German cities in the immediate post-war years . Plans for the recovery of a compressed city centre around the historic town hall in 1991 led to an urban design competition . This was announced internationally by the city and carried out with the help of the partner city of . The mooted project on an essentially unused area of the former city would be comparable in circumference with the in Berlin .",
      "Numerous internationally renowned architects such as , and provided designs for a new city centre . The mid-1990s began the development of the inner city brownfields around the town hall to a new town . In Chemnitz city more than 66,000 square meters of retail space have emerged . With the construction of office and commercial building on the construction site B3 at the court , the last gap in 2010 was closed in city centre image . The intensive development included demolition of partially historically valuable buildings from the period and was controversial . Between 1990 and 2007 more than 250 buildings were leveled .",
      "In late August 2018 the city was the site of a series of protests that attracted at least 8,000 people . The protests were attended by far-right and Neo-Nazi groups . News outlets reported about mob violence and riots . The protests started after two immigrants from the Middle East were arrested in connection with the murder of Daniel H. , a 35 year old German man , the son of a German mother and a Cuban father , which had happened on 26 August . Violent clashes occurred between far-right protesters and far-left counter protesters , leading to injuries . The mobs outnumbered the local police presence . There were reports that rightist protesters chased down dark skinned bystanders and those that appeared to be foreigners on the streets before more police arrived and intervened . The riots were widely condemned by media outlets and politicians throughout Germany , and were described as reminiscent of civil war and Nazi pogroms .",
      "The reports of mob violence and riots were criticized as incorrect later on . The German language Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung corrected its earlier reports , stating that there had evidently been no mob violence but there have been sporadic encroachments . Minister President of Saxony Michael Kretschmer came to the same conclusion : there were no mobs and man hunts .",
      "One week after the protests , a free Concert against the Right under the motto We are more ( #wirsindmehr ) attracted an audience of some 65,000 people . A one-minute silence commemorated the murdered Daniel H. , the son of a German mother and a Cuban father . The concert itself has been criticized for far-left activities and violent song texts of some of the participating bands .",

Landmarks include the Old Town Hall with its Renaissance portal ( 15th century ) , the castle on the site of the former monastery , and the area around the opera house and the old university . The most conspicuous landmark is the red tower built in the late 12th or early 13th century as part of the city wall .",
      "The Chemnitz petrified forest is located in the courtyard of Kulturkaufhaus Tietz . It is one of the very few in existence , and dates back several million years . Also within the city limits , in the district of Rabenstein , is the smallest castle in Saxony , Rabenstein Castle .",
      "The city has changed considerably since German reunification . Most of its industry is now gone and the core of the city has been rebuilt with many shops as well as huge shopping centres . Many of these shops are international brands , including Zara , H&M , Esprit , , Leiser Shoes , and Peek & Cloppenburg . The large ( Red Tower ) shopping centre is very popular with young people .",

These neighborhoods came in the wake of the last incorporation wave after 1990 as formerly independent municipalities to the city of Chemnitz and therefore enjoy this special position compared to the other parts of the city . These localities each have a local council , which , depending on the number of inhabitants of the locality concerned , comprises between ten and sixteen members as well as a chairman of the same . The local councils are to hear important matters concerning the locality . A final decision is , however , incumbent on the city council of the city of Chemnitz . The official identification of the districts by numbers is based on the following principle : Starting from the city center ( neighborhoods Zentrum and Schlo\u00dfchemnitz ) , all other parts of the city are assigned clockwise in ascending order the tenth place of their index , the one-digit is awarded in the direction of city periphery in ascending order .",
      "The city area does not include a unified , closed settlement area after numerous incorporations .

In commenting on Whitmans resignation from the Goldman Sachs board , eBay spokesman Henry Gomez told The Wall Street Journal at the time that , If we wanted to use Goldmans services , she doesnt want there to be even the slightest perception of any conflict . Shes doing this because she thinks quite highly of the firm . While Whitman was on Goldman Sachs board , she served on the compensation committee , which approved multimillion-dollar bonus packages for then-CEO Henry Paulson and his top aides . Public domain documents reveal that Whitman has a multimillion-dollar stake in 21 investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs . Given Goldman Sachs major investments in California state finances , all these ties to Goldman Sachs led to considerable controversy during the gubernatorial campaign .

At the state Republican Convention in March 2010 , Whitman described California Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzeneggers climate change bill as a job-killer . Whitman opposed Proposition 23 , which would delay the global warming law AB 32 until Californias unemployment falls to 5.5 percent and stays there for a year , stating that the proposition did not reasonably balance the need to protect jobs with the need to preserve environment .",

Her opponent Jerry Brown was in favor of the project .",
      "Whitman has made monetary donations to various candidates and political action committees ( PAC ) . While these have gone to both Republicans and Democrats , the donations are weighted to Republicans . Though Whitman has contributed to a few Democrats , including Senator Barbara Boxer ; donating $4,000 to her campaign and serving on the Friends of Boxer committee in 2004 , she donated more than $225,000 during the same period to Republicans , eBays PAC and to Americans for a Republican Majority , the PAC of former Representative Tom DeLay .",

      "Monicas Gang or Monica and Friends ( Portuguese : Turma da M\u00f4nica , British English : Monica & Friends ) is a Brazilian comic book series and media franchise created by Mauricio de Sousa .",
      "The series originated in a newspaper comic strip in which the protagonists were Blu ( Bidu ) and Franklin ( Franjinha ) , launched by the newspaper Folha da Manh\u00e3 in 1959 . As the series continued , the central characters became Jimmy Five ( Cebolinha ) and Monica ( M\u00f4nica ) , both of whom began to appear in eponymous series in addition to the renamed Monica\u2019s Gang . The characters and comics were subsequently adapted into , among other media , an animated television series ; as well as films , most of which are anthologies .",
      "The stories revolve around the adventures of Monica and her friends in the fictional Lemon Tree Street ( Bairro do Limoeiro ) of S\u00e3o Paulo , inspired by the neighborhood of Cambu\u00ed in Campinas and the city of Mogi das Cruzes , where de Sousa spent his childhood . The Monica\u2019s Gang umbrella title also encompasses Chuck Billy n Folks , Tinas Pals , Lionels Kingdom and Bug-a-Booo , among other series .",

      "Publication history .",
      "Maur\u00edcio de Sousa , then reporter for Folha da Manh\u00e3 , in 1959 , decided to enter the field of comics hitherto little disputed in the country . In the same year made his first characters Blu and Franklin , and decided that Blu would be the protagonist . Both were based on his own childhood , Franklin based on Maur\u00edcio himself and Blu on his pet dog Cu\u00edca . The main inspirations of Maur\u00edcio de Sousa were through American comics like Peanuts and Little Lulu , which have inspired some recurring themes like the boys club . In the following year of 1960 , the characters gained ground through the childrens magazine Zaz Traz by publisher Editora Outubro , later getting their own comic titled Bidu by Editora Continental . However , the magazines were canceled that same year .",
      "After that the characters returned to newspaper strips , the character Jimmy Five which had won great popularity in the previous magazines has become protagonist of their own strips of newspaper next to Blu and Franklin in 1961 . Seeing potential in the character , Mauricio went on to create several supporting characters to appear in the Jimmy Five strips , like Smudge and Specs . But after so long Maur\u00edcio received a complaint for the lack of feminine characters in his comics . So to avoid further controversy , in 1963 Monica was created , initially as a supporting character in the Jimmy Five strips ( at first as the Specs little sister ) based on Mauricios real daughter M\u00f4nica Sousa . Over time , the success and the charisma of the character made her be the protagonist of the series alongside Jimmy Five which became her sidekick . Also in 1963 , Mauricio began to create new projects of comic strips with other characters without links with Monica and Jimmy Five , like Zezinho and Hiroshi ( now called Chuck Billy n Folks ) , The Cavern Clan , Bug-a-Booo , The Tribe and Rapos\u00e3o ( now called Lionels Kingdom ) .",

With so many of the characters ever created by Mauricio in strips of newspaper also began to appear in magazines next to Monicas Gang . At that time the area of comics was more played in Brazil , many Brazilian artists were trying to hold his own in the stalls along the publications of American comics like Donald Duck , Jos\u00e9 Carioca , Little Lulu , and many others . Even with these new comics remained with their good sales on newsstands with this soon came to Jimmy Five magazine three years later . Sales were great and with that a contract with the footballer Pel\u00e9 with Maur\u00edcio for the launch of a character based on him the , which was phenomenon among children at the time history logging in Brazilian comics .",
      "The staff of cartoonists has grown , leading to the foundation of the Est\u00fadios Maur\u00edcio de Sousa , who produce comics with increasingly faster thus appearing more marketing projects and producing cartoons . The first attempts to make a Monicas Gang cartoon occurred in the late 60s during a deal with food company that produced some commercials for television , these being commercial who originated the character Thunder , who is currently a main character of the Lionels Kingdom . The first film was only released in 1982 , which was produced in partnership with Black & White & Color and distributed by Embrafilme .",

      "Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge",
      "Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge is a United States National Wildlife Refuge ( NWR ) , and part of the Everglades Headwaters NWR complex , located just off the western coast of North Hutchinson Island in the Indian River Lagoon east of Sebastian , Florida . The refuge consists of a island that includes an additional of surrounding water and is located off the east coast of Florida of the Indian River Lagoon . Established by an executive order of President Theodore Roosevelt on March 14 , 1903 , Pelican Island was the first National wildlife refuge in the United States . It was created to protect egrets and other birds from extinction through plume hunting .",
      "Management .",
      "Pelican Island is administered as part of the Everglades Headwaters NWR complex along with Archie Carr NWR , Lake Wales Ridge NWR , and the Everglades Headwaters NWR and Conservation Area , created in 2012 ( 556th unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System ) with a donation and other lands covering approximately north of Lake Okeechobee . will be held under conservation easements through the U.S . Department of the Interior and the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . This allows landowners the right to retain ownership of the land , with the ability to continue farming or ranching , ensuring that the land cant be subdivided or developed .",
      "Pelican Island NWR has been placed on the List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance along with other areas of wetlands in the United States .",
      "Early history .",
      "Pelican Islands bird populations were threatened because of increased American settlement around the area in the mid-19th century . Many of the exotic birds were killed for their feathers , used in the fashion industry . Plumes from the birds were used to adorn ladies hats of the day and at the time were worth more than their weight in gold .",
      "Paul Kroegel , a German immigrant , moved to Florida in 1881 and lived on the west bank of Indian River Lagoon . He was fascinated with the pelicans on the island . Being able to see the island from his home , Paul would watch the pelicans and other water birds . He eventually took an interest in the island and its protection . However , there was not any state or federal law to help him so he took control of the situation himself . Kroegel sailed to the island to stand guard and protect the birds and the island .",
      "A few naturalists visited Kroegel at Pelican Island . A curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York , Frank Chapman , was one of the naturalists showing interest in the island as well . He discovered that Pelican Island was one of the last rookeries of Brown pelicans on the eastern coast of Florida .",
      "The American Ornithologists Union and the Florida Audubon Society led a campaign to pass legislation for protection of non-game birds in 1901 . Knowing that the protection of Pelican Island would require more legislation , Chapman and his fellow advocate , William Dutcher went to President Theodore Roosevelt at his home in New York . The two appealed their case to Roosevelts conservative ethics . President Roosevelt signed an executive order that established Pelican Island as the first federal bird reservation . This was the first time that the federal government put land aside for the sake of wildlife . The area , however , was open for big game hunters .",
      "Recent threats .",
      "During the 1960s , Pelican Island was threatened by attempts to sell the surrounding wetlands and islands to developers . Local citizens led a fight to protect Pelican Island by stopping the sale of the wetlands . The Indian River Area Preservation League , formed by local citrus growers , commercial fishermen , and sportsmen , joined with Florida Audubon Society to convince the State to include the islands as a part of the refuge .",
      "Later in 1963 , Pelican Island was designated as a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior because of its status as the first federal area set aside specifically to protect wildlife .",
      "In 1968 , Florida agreed to expand to include nearly 5000 acres ( 20 km\u00b2 ) of mangrove islands and other submerged lands . And then in 1970 , Pelican Island became the smallest wilderness area in the National Wilderness Preservation System . Since , the refuge has gained over 500 acres ( 2 km\u00b2 ) through purchases , management agreements , and conservation easements to provide a buffer against encroaching development and also to be a link to the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge . Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge was added to the list of wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention signed in 1971 .",
      "Today , Pelican Island is also threatened by shoreline development . Shoreline development has many negative impacts associated with it . Shoreline development can reduce the water quality by increasing the runoff of sediments , fertilizers , and pesticides . These runoffs will cause decline in water quality , and this can directly affect the food base that sustains the islands nesting bird colonies . Waterfront development will also lead to more boat traffic . This extra boat traffic will also negatively affect the birds on the coast . Not only this , development of the shorelines of Pelican Island will permanently flaw the pristine character of this unique National Historic Landmark .",
      "Physical environment .",
      "The environment of Pelican Island consists of climate , topography , geology , air quality , and waterways .",
      "Climate .",
      "The climate at Pelican Island NWR is subtropical and temperate and experiences an average temperate of . Pelican Island has long , warm , and humid summers and short , mild winters and has an average rainfall of about annually . Pelican Island may experience tropical storms in the period from May to November .",
      "Topography .",
      "The elevation of Pelican Island changes from east to west . It rises sharply from sea level to about and then drops back down more slowly to below sea level in the Indian River Lagoon . The land between the Indian River Lagoon and St . Sebastian River is . Even further west , there is an ancient dune that rises in elevation from to .",
      "Geology .",
      "The landscape of Pelican Island area is made of Pleistocene ( glacial ) and Holocene ( recent ) origin . Submerged lands were exposed during the late Pleistocene period , allowing for the spread of flora and fauna from the peninsula . Wetlands , salt marshes , mangroves , and other swampy formations make up the uplands and submerged lands .",
      "Soil .",
      "The general soils in the Pelican Island Refuge are Canaveral-Captiva-Palm Beach , which is characterized by the gently sloping , somewhat poorly drained to moderately drained sandy soils with shell fragments , and McKee-Quartzipsamments-St . Augustine , which is characterized by level , somewhat poorly drained soils mixed with sand and shell fragments . Other soils include Canaveral Fine Sand , Quartzipsamments , Captiva Fine Sand , McKee Mucky Clay Loam , and Kesson Muck .",
      "Air quality .",
      "Good air quality is vital for the refuge to maintain itself . A few problems dealing with air pollution are carbon monoxide , lead , nitrogen dioxide , ozone , particulate matter , and sulfur dioxide . The primary producers of these pollutants are vehicle emissions , power plants , and industrial activities . The Indian River Lagoon area is said to have good air quality . Sometimes occasional temperate increases can temporarily degrade the air quality below the accepted levels .",
      "Waterways .",
      "The Indian River Lagoon stretches from Ponce de Leon south of Daytona Beach to Jupiter Inlet near West Palm Beach , a distance of about , and contains a number of small rivers , creeks , and canals . The Intracoastal Waterway is the deepest part of the Lagoon . St . Sebastian River and Turkey Creek provide freshwater to the Lagoon . Water quality is also a concern in the refuge : cadmium , lead , mercury , nutrients , selenium , thallium , and dissolved oxygen . The water circulation is affected by the Intracoastal Waterway , winds , inlets , and causeways . Within the refuge boundary , the water quality is generally better compared to portions of the Lagoon .",
      "Wildlife .",
      "Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge holds hundreds of species of animals including birds , fish , plants , and mammals . The wetlands of Pelican Island are a major ecological system supporting the huge biological diversity . Fifteen federally listed threatened and endangered species live in Pelican Island NWR and around Indian River Lagoon . Of the endangered species , West Indian manatees and sea turtles occupy parts of the lagoon . Around the lagoon in the refuge are two wood stork refuges . These birds along with other wading birds that nest on the island thrive on the tremendous fish population . Pelican Island is home to many nesting birds including brown pelicans , great egrets , snowy egrets , reddish egrets , great blue heron , little blue heron , tricolored heron , black-crowned night heron , American white ibis , glossy ibis , double-crested cormorant , anhinga , and American oystercatcher .",
      "Visiting .",
      "Pelican Island is only accessible by boat or chartered tours . Nesting birds are easily disturbed , so people are not allowed to get too close or to disembark . Visiting during nesting season ( late November through late July ) , one can expect to see brown pelican , wood storks , white ibises , black-crowned night herons , double-crested cormorants , reddish , snowy , and great egrets , and great blue , little blue and tricolored herons . Traveling in the winter , look for lesser scaup , blue-winged teal , mottled ducks , great northern divers , laughing gulls , American white pelicans , and red-breasted mergansers . Summer visitors should watch for roseate spoonbills , magnificent frigatebirds and least terns . Pelican Island also features some marine life in the Indian River including sea turtles , dolphins , and manatees .",
      "New public facilities were opened and dedicated on March 14 , 2003 , in ceremonies marking the centennial of Pelican Island and the National Wildlife Refuge System . A 37\u00a2 US Commemorative Stamp in honor of the NWR Centennial was issued as part of the celebration . The new facilities include a 1/4 mile boardwalk and observation tower to view Pelican Island , two salt marsh impoundment foot trails , interpretive signs , informational kiosks , restrooms and parking areas . The facilities are west of Highway A1A on the north end of Historic Jungle Trail . They were produced through a partnership with Indian River County , St . Johns River Water Management District , Florida Inland Navigation District , Florida Power and Light , ConocoPhillips , Wild Birds Unlimited , the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation , and many others . Future plans include additional boardwalks , an overlook , a photo blind and a wildlife drive .",
      "Jungle Trail .",
      "The historic Jungle Trail is a 7.8 mile sandy road with a section that goes through the refuge . Citrus growers originally built this road in the 1920s and it is now on the National Register of Historic Places .",
      "Budget cuts .",
      "Pelican Island , along with many other wildlife refuges , has been experiencing budget cuts . Many problems arise from the stagnant budget and lack of maintenance in the wildlife refuges . These are vital to preserve the habitat and the wildlife and to provide public education and recreation . This situation worsened further because of the failure of congress to timely pass federal funding bills .",
      "Staffing at Pelican Island is made up of U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . The staff members have recently fallen from six to two which has had many negative consequences . The cuts have led to limiting refuge work and restricting public visitation . Another consequence is the end of 14-year tradition of the wildlife festival . Pelican Island will be losing its only public-use staff and eliminating all active outreach at the nations first wildlife refuge . Pelican Island Refuge manager and project leader Paul Tritaik said in 2006 that reductions to a full-time staff would lead to the end of some refuge activities and the loss of several trails ."

      "Conrad Theodor van Deventer",
      "Conrad Theodor Coen van Deventer ( 29 September 1857 , in Dordrecht \u2013 27 September 1915 , in The Hague ) was a Dutch lawyer , an author about the Dutch East Indies and a member of parliament of the Netherlands . He became known as the spokesman of the Dutch Ethical Policy Movement . He lived at Surinamestraat 20 , The Hague ( 1903\u20131915 ) , former residence of John Ricus Couperus , his son writer Louis Couperus and the rest of his family ( 1884\u20131902 ) .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early career .",
      "Van Deventer was a son of Christiaan Julius van Deventer and Anne Marie Busken Huet . His uncle was the writer Conrad Busken Huet . He married Elisabeth Maria Louise Maas ; they had no children . Van Deventer attended the H.B.S . in Deventer and studied law at Leiden University . He achieved his doctorate in September 1879 on the thesis : Zijn naar de grondwet onze koloni\u00ebn delen van het rijk ( are , according to the constitution , our colonies part of the Dutch empire ) .",
      "On 20 August 1880 he was made available to the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies by the Ministry of Colonies to be appointed as civil service official . With his wife Van Deventer travelled in September 1880 to Batavia by steamboat Prins Hendrik ; he was appointed court clerk at the Raad van Justitie ( Council of Justice ) at Amboina in December 1880 . As early as 1881 Van Deventer was already seen by the public as an authority in the case of the issue of the economic position of the Dutch East Indies in relation to motherland the Netherlands . In lectures held during meetings of the Indisch Genootschap ( Indies Institute ) his opinion on this matter was presented as very important .",
      "In June 1882 Van Deventer was appointed court clerk at the Landraden ( land boards ) of Amboina , Saparua and Wahoo ; he was also appointed auditeur militair ( a legal position ) at the court-martial in Amboina . In March 1883 he was appointed member of the Council of Justice in Semarang and that same year he wrote a series of articles in the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad , under the title Gedichten van F.L . Hemkes ( poetry by F.L . Hemkes ; Frederik Leonardus Hemkes was a Dutch poet , who lived in South-Africa ( 1854\u20131887 ) ) . Van Deventer wrote in February 1884 an article in Het Indisch Weekblad voor het Recht ( The Dutch Indies Journal of Law ) , called De Indische Militairen en het Koninklijke Besluit van 13 Oktober 1882 nummer 26 ( The military in the Dutch East Indies and the royal order of 13 October 1882 ) , in which he discussed the trial of a Buginese soldier in front of a civil ( police ) court instead of a military one . In April 1885 Van Deventer quit his job as a member of the Council of Justice in Semarang and was appointed lawyer and attorney at this Council of Justice . In this period of his life Van Deventer was also active as a second lieutenant in the schutterij . That same year , 1885 , he quit his job at the Council of Justice and joined the legal practice of LLM B.R.W.A . baron Sloet van Hagensdorp and LLM M.H.C . van Oosterzee ; he replaced mr . Van Oosterzee , who would return to the Netherlands .",
      "Career as a private lawyer .",
      "Van Deventer worked as a private lawyer from 1885 to 1888 . In May 1888 he took a leave for Europe and travelled with his wife by steamboat Prinses Amalia from Batavia to the Netherlands . Back in Europe he wrote a series of articles , called De Wagner-feesten te Bayreuth ( the Wagner festivals in Bayreuth ) , which he visited for the newspaper De Locomotief ; in this period Van Deventer was a permanent employee of this newspaper . He returned to the Dutch Indies on 11 May 1889 by steamboat Sumatra . He resumed his lawyers practice and also became commissioner of the limited liability company H\u020ftel du Pavillon . In September 1892 he was appointed acting member of the Committee of Directors of the Nederlands-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij ( Dutch East Indian Railway Company ) . In July 1893 Van Deventer was promoted to the military rank of first lieutenant at the Schutterij in Semarang .",
      "He left for a second short stay in Europe in May 1894 and was , after his return , appointed member of the supervisory committee of the HBS in Semarang . In the newspaper Locomotief he wrote an article called Samarangsche bazar \u2013 eigen hulp ( Bazar of Samarang ) , in which he defended himself against accusations that the prospectus of this firm ( Samarangsche bazar ) , made up by him , was not accurate . He left the Dutch East Indies ( permanently ) in April 1897 by steamboat Koningin-Regentes ; back in Europe he visited the Wagner festivals and wrote about Wagneriana in The Locomotief of 11 November and 16 December 1897 . In 1898 Van Deventer wrote several articles about the coronation celebrations in the Netherlands , where queen Wilhelmina was crowned , in the Locomotief . He also wrote a series of four articles , called Het Wilhelmus als Nederlands Volkslied ( the Wilhelmus as the Dutch national anthem ) , for the Locomotief that year and gave in the Locomotief his perspective on the Zola trial .",
      "Early political career .",
      "In 1899 Van Deventer wrote a very influential article , called Een Ereschuld ( a debt of honour ) in the Dutch magazine De Gids . In this article Van Deventer stated that the Netherlands had a dept of honor of nearly 190 million gulden opposite the Dutch East Indies and had to pay for this dept of honor . When the Dutch East Indian budget was discussed in the House of Representatives a lot of attention was paid to Van Deventers article , although not all members agreed with the content of the article . Van Deventer was appointed member of the editorial board of The Gids as of 1 January 1901 . Over the next years until his death he would write numerous articles in this magazine . In June 1901 Van Deventer accepted his candidacy for the electoral association Schiedam ( for the Free-thinking Democratic League ) , located the Schiedam , for the elections for the House of Representatives , but was not chosen . In lectures Van Deventer showed himself a supporter for the installation of a Dutch East Indian House of Representatives in the Dutch East Indies . In June 1902 he was appointed member of the Algemeen Nederlands Verbond ( General Dutch Covenant ) and wrote in het Tijdschrift voor Nederlands-Indi\u00eb ( Magazine for the Dutch East Indies ) together with others , a concept colonial program ; in this program the authors stated that the administrative power should lie more with the residents of the Dutch East Indies and that the government of the Netherlands should limit its interference to general government principles only . It seems contradictory that he also signed the telegram , send to general J . B . van Heutsz , in which he was complemented with the submission of Panglima Polim ( a local leader ) , which was achieved by military force , in Aceh .",
      "Van Deventer became a member of the board of the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies ( 1903 ) and that same year attended the meeting in London of the Institut Colonial International . In September 1904 he was appointed knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion . He kept writing articles in different magazines , other than The Gids ; for instance he published a series of four articles in the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad in December 1904 , called Over de suikercultuur- en suikerindustrie ( about the sugar industry ) . On 19 September 1905 Van Deventer was elected as a Free-thinking Democratic member of the House of Representatives for the constituency Amsterdam IX and as such he emphasized his three focus points regarding Dutch East Indian policy : education , irrigation and emigration . He was also a promoter of the so-called Dutch Ethical Policy but at the same time said in a speech given in the House of Representatives on 16 November 1905 , that if persuasion did not work it would be inevitable to use military force . In a series of articles in the Soerabajasch Handelsblad in August 1908 called Insulindes toekomst ( the future of the Dutch East Indies ) he wrote about the importance of eductation and the creation of new jobs for natives on higher management levels . Van Deventer was not reelected and left the House of Representatives on 21 September 1909 .",
      "Later political career .",
      "Van Deventer was elected to be a member of parliament again on 19 September 1911 , when he was appointed member of the Senate by the States of Friesland . In this period he was also appointed as member of the Max Havelaar Foundation ; this foundation was named after the famous book , written by Multatuli , and the aim of the foundation was the material and spiritual upliftment of the natives in the Dutch East Indies . In February 1912 Van Deventer made , as a member of the Senate , a journey of several months to the Dutch East Indies . He visited almost all islands , including but not limited to Sumatra , Java , Celebes and Borneo . He remained a Senate member until 16 September 1913 , when he was reelected as a member of the House of Representatives for the constituency Assen . He kept this position until his death , on 27 September 1915 . In June 1914 he was appointed official delegate of the Netherlands at the International Opium Conference held in The Hague . In 1913 he founded the Kartini Foundation in order to be able to establish girl schools in the Dutch East Indies . In September 1915 Van Deventer became seriously ill ( he suffered from peritonitis ) and was nursed at the Red Cross hospital in The Hague . He died at the age of 57 on 27 September 1915 and his body was cremated at Westerveld ( Driehuis ) .",
      "Works .",
      "Summary .",
      "For the most part Van Deventer wrote about Dutch East Indian finance , the rights of the native officials and their education and about the sugar industry . When he was active as a journalist for the Locomotief he was particularly interested in Wagner and the Wagner Festival . As he was a member of the board of directors of the magazine De Gids most of his later articles were published there .",

      "The 1962\u20131972 decade is known as the Golden decade of Olympiakos as the club was champion of the Cypriot First Division three times , another three times it was runner-up , while it became the only Cyprus football club that participated three times in the Greek National 1st Division Championship .",
      "It all started in the 1961\u201362 season , when Olympiakos reached the cup final for the first time in the clubs history . Despite this , the team did not manage to win the cup trophy , as it lost from Anorthosis Famagusta FC with a score of 5\u20132 .",
      "The foundations had been laid however , in the 1964\u201365 season , Giorgos Paletsios an old Olympiakos football player for 18 years , who had also served as team captain , agreed to manage the team , without being paid a salary for his services . Paletsios proceeded to restructure the teams squad promoting to the first team young and talented players including : Kettenis , Limbouris , Argyrou . Bolstered with young enthusiasm , the team finished in second place in the championship , while in the same year the top scorer of the championship was Olympiakos player Kostakis Pierides , scoring 21 goals .",
      "In the 1965\u201366 season Olympiakos was once again runner-up , with 49 points , one point less than the then champion Omonoia . Top scorer of the championship was again an Olympiakos player , Panikos Efthymiades scoring 23 goals .",
      "In the 1966\u201367 season Olympiakos dominated the Cypriot Championship , with Pambos Avraamidis as their manager , the team finished in first place and won the championship with 55 points as many as APOEL Nicosia , who in the last game of the season beat Aris Limassol with the huge score of 17\u20131 . The title was judged on goal difference and despite APOELs huge score in the last game of the season , Olympiakos still had a superior goal difference so that the club was crowned champion .",
      "In 1967 , the champion Olympiakos played against the Cup-winner Apollon Limassol , winning 1\u20130 therefore gaining the Pakkos Shield ( as the Super Cup/Shield was then known. )",
      "In the 1968\u201369 season , Olympiakos won the championship for a second time , collecting 52 points the same number as AC Omonoia . Olympiakos was champion however because of the better goal difference . Top scorer of the championship was once again Panikos Efthymiades scoring 17 goals .",
      "The third Olympiakos championship came in the 1970\u201371 season with Englishman Rod Bradley as the manager , the team finished in first place with 31 points compared to 27 of runner up Digenis Morfou . The title of top scorer was shared by 3 footballers who all scored 11 goals amongst them once again Panikos Efthymiades .",
      "In the 1972\u201373 season Olympiakos finished runner-up , while in the 1974\u201375 season the team finished third .",
      "In 1971 Olympiakos won the Paligenesias cup that was organised by the Cyprus Football Association ( KOP ) , defeating Nea Salamis Famagusta FC . In this golden period , Olympiakos managers were : Pambos Avraamidis , Giorgos Paletsios , Takis Papaxeniou , Eric Brookes and Rod Bradley .",
      "Andreas Filotas , Varnavas Christofi , Nikos Theocharidis , Demos Flourentzou , Giorgos Hadjikonstantis , Dimitrakis Argyrou , Yiannis Xipolitas , Savvakis Constantinou , Michalakis Argyrou , Sotirakis Georgiou , Lakis Avraamidis , Markos Markou , Andreas Nicolaou ( Lympoyris ) , Vasilis Fragkiskou ( Katsis ) , Dimitriadis , Tasos Louka , Andreas Assiotis , Giorgos Kettenis , Panikos Efthymiades , Kostakis Pierides , Charalambos Partasidis , Giannos Pavlou , Takis Papettas , Kokos Michael , Nikos Mailos , Michalis Stavrou , Giorgos Aristeidou , Koullis Iliadis , Lakis Mitsidis , Panagiotis Prodromou , Giannis Serafeim were the footballers of the great successes of this period .",
      "Greek Experience .",
      "Olympiakos became the first Cypriot football team that participated in the Pan-Hellenic",
      "Championship , in the 1967\u201368 season , something which recurred twice more , in 1969\u201370 , and in 1971\u201372 , rendering the club the only Cypriot team that participated three times in the Greek National 1st Division Championship . Olympiakos has also taken part in all three European competitions .",
      "European Experience .",
      "In the European Champions Cup in 1967 the club faced FK Sarajevo Yugoslavia . In the first game the teams drew 2\u20132 , while in second game Olympiakos lost with 3\u20131 .",
      "Also in the European Champions Cup , Olympiakos Nicosia played against Real Madrid in 1969 , losing both matches with 8\u20130 and 6\u20131 .",
      "Olympiakos later played in the same competition in 1971 and met Feyenoord of the Netherlands and lost 8\u20130 and 9\u20130 .",
      "In the Cup Winners Cup , Olympiakos took part once in 1977 playing against FC Universitatea Craiova Romania while in 1973 Olympiakos played against the German team VfB Stuttgart for the UEFA Cup .",
      "In all these European games Olympiakos was forced to play both games away from home as at the time the Cypriot football stadia did not meet the European regulations .",
      "Cup glory .",
      "In 1977 , Olympiakos Nicosia beat Alki Larnaca 2\u20130 to win the Cypriot Cup after two thunder bolts from English center half , captain and talisman Mreg Goffatt . In 1991 , Olympiakos Nicosia lost the Cypriot Cup in the finals losing 1\u20130 to AC Omonia . That was their last appearance in the Cypriot Cup finals .",
      "Glory days revisited .",
      "Olympiakos Nicosia also played in the UEFA Cup ( after finishing runner up in the Cypriot championship ) in the 2001\u201302 season against the Hungarian team Dunaferr FC ( drawing 2\u20132 in Nicosia and scoring a 2\u20134 away win , the first for the club in Europe ) and proceeded to the next round of the Uefa Cup to play against Club Brugge of Belgium and was eventually eliminated .",
      "Recent decline .",
      "With Olympiakos TV rights hastily agreed at the lowest amount for any Cypriot first division club in 2007 for 9 seasons and these rights assigned to repay old debts until 2016 the club has little cash inflow apart from gate receipts and commercial sponsorships .",
      "After a disastrous 2007\u20132008 season , where economic problems hindered the building of a strong squad , Olympiakos Nicosia finished bottom of the Cypriot First Division ( the first time the club finished bottom ) . The club was relegated for the third time in its history . In both the 1983\u201384 and 1997\u201398 seasons the club had spent just one season in the second tier of Cypriot football , only to win the Cypriot Second Division title each time and return to the Cypriot First Division .",
      "The club tried to re-organise itself and to return to the top flight as quickly as possible . In the 2008\u201309 season the club finished fourth and missed the promotion to the Cypriot First Division on the last day of the season by one point .",
      "In the 2009\u201310 season , an old goalkeeper of Olympiakos Petros Savva , was appointed as the new chairman . Savva initially re-appointed Andros Kouloumbris , an old midfield player of Olympiakos , as manager . After the end of the first round , however , Kouloumbris was sacked due to the bad defensive record of the team , despite the team being in 3rd place .",
      "The next coach for 7 games was Sa\u0161a Jovanovi\u0107 who only managed two wins , with the team languishing in 5th place after some bad appearances , Sa\u0161a Jovanovi\u0107 was removed to make way for old Olympiakos midfield player and ex-manager Nikodimos Papavasiliou .",
      "With Papavasiliou at the helm the team improved and entered the play-offs for promotion to the Cypriot First Division after finishing third at the end of the regular season . The club finished third at the end of the play-offs and therefore gained promotion , despite helping the team with winning promotion Nikodimos Papavasilious contract was not renewed at the end of the season .",
      "Return to the top flight .",
      "After 2 seasons Olympiakos returned to the top flight in the 2010\u20132011 season and Pambos Christodoulou an old Olympiakos midfield player and ex-manager of Doxa Katokopias was appointed as manager . Olympiakos showed good attacking football in the 2010\u20132011 season , easily avoiding relegation and having qualified for the Cup quarterfinals . The club played fluid attacking football having the third best attacking record after leaders APOEL and 3rd placed Anorthosis , playing with a 4\u20134\u20132 formation with pressing from within the opponents half , but the Achilles heel of the team was the bad defensive record with goals conceded in most games and the third worst record in this area . Christodoulou decided to leave the club in 2011 to join AEL Limassol , one year before his contract expired . The club decided to pursue this breach in court ( in an out of court settlement AEL Limassol paid an undisclosed sum of money to Olympiakos to avoid sanctions against them and Pambos ) and Christodoulou angered both the club president and the supporters , as well as the Cypriot football fans in general , with his unprofessional conduct .",
      "Striving for Stability .",
      "In the 2011\u20132012 season there were a few changes in Olympiakos , the new Greek manager was ex Xanthi FC Nikos Papadopoulos who mainly brought in defensive players playing in the Greek league to strengthen this area of weakness . Few additions were made to the attacking mechanism of the team and some early warnings in the pre season friendlies indicated that after the departure of the previous seasons top scorer , the team would be less productive in scoring than last season , which was in fact the case . Papadopoulos was released by mutual consent at the end of February 2012 with the club in the cup quarterfinals but fourth from bottom in the league , although defensively the club was marginally better it lost its attacking flair and pressing style with majority ball possession and suffered from conceding goals right after scoring .",
      "Nikodimos Papavasiliou was again appointed as manager for 2012 , after lowering his wage by mutual consent with chairman Savva . It was announced that the budget would be reduced from the previous season and to achieve this only a few players from the previous seasons squad remained . The team started the season with a 3-point deduction after failing to meet the UEFA Financial fair play criteria . Papavasiliou received an offer from Apollon Limassol after 2 games in charge of Olympiakos and was released from his contract by mutual consent .",
      "Renos Demetriades an old Olympiakos Nicosia defensive player was appointed as the new coach . Olympiakos was close to mid-table with Demetriades and despite the loss of key players in the January transfer window was on track to keep its top level status , until an unexpected home loss which plunged the club in a battle for survival forced the club to replace Demetriades with Marios Constantinou .",
      "Economic Decline .",
      "The club was relegated , for a fourth time in its history , on the last day of the 2012\u20132013 season , finishing third from bottom , while being level on points , but was demoted due to the inferior head to head record with Nea Salamis Famagusta FC .",
      "The club started the new 2013\u20132014 season with a 6-point deduction after failing to meet the UEFA Financial fair play criteria . Chairman Petros Savva resigned and Manager Marios Constantinou left making way for old Olympiakos Nicosia defensive midfielder Costas Seraphim . Old chairman Demos Georgiades stepped in as acting chairman and the club used the Makario stadium as the home ground . Seraphim who was offering his services for free , totally reorganised the club for the new season .",
      "From the senior players only captain , defender Nikolas Nicolaou and midfielder , vice-captain Kyriacos Polycarpou remained . All the foreign players left . The young Olympiakos players such as forward Giannis Mavrou and goalkeeper Constantinos Panagi stepped up to fill in the places in the starting line up . Together with other local players all under 21 years old as well as 3 under 21 foreign players , the club was trying to reorganize and return to the top flight as soon as possible .",
      "After 4 games with 3 wins the club managed to erase the 6-point deduction and register a positive point tally . Had the penalty not been imposed the club would have been top of the league . After the positive start to the season , the young players were unable to take the pressure of the rugged Cypriot Second Division and six consecutive defeats and a further 3-point deduction , meant the resignation of coach Costas Seraphim in December 2013 , the replacement was Savvas Paraskeva , an ex Cypriot youth team national coach . The arrival of Paraskeva , did not arrest the clubs decline and the club finished 6th . After a further change of rules , with 14 teams playing in the second division , the club was spared the humiliation of third tier football and played in the second division for the 2014\u20132015 season . With around 1.6 million Euro of total legacy debt ( old players , banks , creditors and the state ) however , the future of the club was looking all the more uncertain .",
      "In the 2014\u20132015 season the club started with a 3-point deduction and was further hit with a 3-point deduction by December and spent a record third consecutive season in the second tier . The new Manager was ex Olympiakos attacking midfielder Goran Petkovski and the new chairman was Marios Mavrikios , an ex press spokesman of the club during the early 2000s . The club was again in survival mode , trying to survive the drop and pay down the old debts , with only 3 foreign players under 21 , two senior Cypriot players and all the rest being Cypriot players under 21 . The new club board , managed to reduce the debt to 26 old players to around 600,000 Euro and the club survived in the last game of the season by winning in an away game .",
      "In the 2015\u20132016 season the club yet again started with a 3-point deduction however with the same Manager and chairman as the previous season , the club set as its goal to return to the Cypriot First Division . In order to achieve this , funds to pay down debts to old players and to lift the embargo of signing senior players was the first objective . Old captain , defensive midfielder and manager Costas Seraphim took over as chairman on 27 July , the embargo was lifted on 28 August by reducing debt to old players to 470,000 Euro and the chairman announced the release of manager Goran Petkovski on 29 August and on 1 September hired Chrysis Michael . The club had a good season and was second for most of the season , falling to third with one game remaining . However , they drew in the last game , thus missing the promotion due to an inferior head to head record with Anagennisi Dherynia , thus staying in the second tier for a record fourth season .",
      "In the 2016\u20132017 season , the club set again as its goal to return to the Cypriot First Division . Chrysis Michael remained in his post . The new president was Dr Andreas Aristodemou . The debt to 22 old players was reduced to 420,000 Euro . Greek Giannis Georgaras was hired as Technical Director . On 24 July the contract with Chrysis Michael was terminated by mutual consent and ex-captain Nikolas Nicolaou took over as caretaker manager until 12 August 2016 when Savvas Paraskeva took over the helm . Nicolaou returned to his position of U21 manager . On 3 November 2016 the president resigned and Costas Seraphim retook the helm . He terminated the contract of manager Savvas Paraskeva by mutual consent as well as of the Technical Director and re hired Chrysis Michael as manager on 4 November 2016 . In early January to mid March the club was in third place and gained promotion to the first division after four seasons .",
      "In the 2017\u20132018 season , the clubs goal was to avoid relegation . FIFA had imposed an embargo on signing new players over 18 , so the club had to compete in the first division with its existing squad until January . The debt to old players was nevertheless reduced to 350,000 euro and the total legacy debt had been reduced to 1.2 million euro . At the end of the first round the club was in 11th place just above the relegation spots , falling to 12th place after 21 games and in the battle to survive relegation . The club finished in 12th place , avoiding direct relegation at the end of",
      "the second round and earned the opportunity to avoid relegation in the third round . The debt to old players was reduced to 225,000 euro and the total legacy debt to below 1 million euro . With 7 games remaining and the club in the relegation spot , 9 points off safety , the contract with Chrysis Michael was terminated by mutual consent and Vesko Mihajlovi\u0107 was hired for the last 7 games of the season , with only one win and the club relegated for the fifth time , with 3 games remaining , Vesko Mihajlovi\u0107 resigned and captain Kyriacos Polykarpou took over as caretaker manager , until the end of the season . The debt to old players was reduced to 125,000 euro and the total legacy debt to below 600,000 euro .",
      "In the 2018\u20132019 season Costas Seraphim remained president and was backed by the old president of the glory days of the early 2000s , Christopher Tornaritis , as head of the football department . Their first move is to hire Costas Malekkos as manager , with a view of returning to the top flight immediately . After two successive defeats in the first two games of the new season , Malekkos was replaced by Fangio Buyse who brought consecutive wins and the club was in first place after 11 games . Four games before the end of the season the club dropped to third place outside the promotion spots and Buyse was replaced by Kyriacos Polycarpou , an old player of the club , as caretaker manager , who lifted the club to second place and promotion . The debt was stabilised .",
      "Stability Regained .",
      "In the 2019\u20132020 season Seraphim and Tornaritis , with the club returning to the First Division , re- hired Pambos Christodoulou as manager . Pambos renewed the contracts of central defender Nani Soares from Guinea-Bissau , Cypriot defensive midfielder Andreas Pachipis , Portuguese winger Rogerio Silva , defensive midfielder Evgenios Antoniou , Venezuelan forward Jose Romo and Cypriot left back Constantinos Samaras . The latter three were subsequently loaned to other clubs . His first signings were Cypriot right back Paris Psaltis , Cameroonian defensive midfielder Eyong Enoh , central defender Sambinha from Guinea-Bissau , Cypriot defensive midfielder Giorgos Economides , goalkeepers Pavol Bajza from Slovakia and Mario Kirev from Bulgaria , Portuguese left back Kiko , Cameroonian winger Fabrice Kah , Cypriot defensive midfielder Evangelos Kyriacou , Cypriot Striker Panayiotis Zachariou , Venezuelan midfielder Rafael Acosta , Brazilian Forward Azul\u00e3o and Ghanaian centre back Ousmane Sidib\u00e9 . The season was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Cyprus and Olympiakos achieved the 9th place , securing participation regarding the next seasons First Division .",
      "During June 2020 , the director of football hired Greek Giannis Petrakis as the new head coach for the new season . The contracts of Guinea-Bissauan central defenders Sambinha and Nani Soares were renewed , as well as Cameroonian winger Fabrice Kah . Cypriot right backs Paris Psaltis and Evangelos Kyriacou stayed at the club . With Cypriot Defender Constantinos Soteriou and star winger Panayiotis Zachariou also staying . The first signings were Cypriot winger Marios Pechlivanis who returned to the club , Greek goalkeeper Christos Karadais , Cameroonian winger Edgar Salli and goalkeeper Neofytos Michael who also returned to his boyhood club .",
      "Giannis Petrakis left the club in November , for Apollon Limassol after receiving an offer against the buyout clause in his contract . This angered the Olympiakos Nicosia supporters and Director of Football Tornaritis , who demanded a higher payout to release him . This was achieved via Giannis Petrakis returning pre-paid bonuses . Costas Seraphim the Technical Director took over as caretaker manager for 5 games . Initially after achieving two wins he was made permanent manager , but a draw and two losses forced him to return to his old post . Leonidas Vokolos took over debuting with a draw at home versus Ermis Aradippou . The new manager faces injuries and suspensions in his effort to retain the club in the top six . After being in charge for 8 games scoring only two draws , Leonidas Vokolos was replaced by Cedomir Janevski . Cedomir Janevski led the club to the top 6 championship group gaining 13 points in the playoffs . Moreover , he also led the club to the first cup final in 30 years where Olympiakos lost 2-1 to Anorthosis Famagusta during the extra-time period .",
      "Stadium .",
      "Since 2013 , the club has played at the Makario Stadium , where they also played in 1998\u20131999 and 2008\u20132009 .",
      "Previously Olympiakos had played at the old GSP Stadium ( 1934\u20131998 ) and the new GSP Stadium ( 2000\u20132008 ) ( 2009\u20132013 ) . Both stadiums were also shared with APOEL and Omonoia but Olympiakos was the only club playing at the old GSP Stadium between 1978 and 1998 as Apoel and Omonoia had both moved to Makario .",
      "Supporters .",
      "Olympiakos supporters since 2004 are organised under the Panhellenic Fans Association Taktakalas 1931 which takes its name from the area of old Nicosia where the clubhouse and the original training ground and now football academy Promahonas ( near the old Venetian Walls of Nicosia ) are located . 1931 refers to the date of foundation of the football club .",
      "Traditionally Olympiakos was supported by residents of the inner old part of Nicosia within the Venetian Walls , the attendance at home games peaked in the late 1960s and early 1970s when fans from all over Cyprus would attend Olympiakos home games at the old GSP stadium filling it to its 12,000 capacity , especially when the club participated three times in the Greek First Division . After 1977 when the club won its last major title , the fanbase started to shrink . From a position where it could rival the other two Nicosia clubs , the fanbase dwindled for two reasons . Firstly outward migration from the Nicosia city centre to the suburbs after 1974 meant that the neighbourhoods of traditional Olympiakos supporters were becoming less populated , despite this trend the club made a conscious decision to leave the new clubhouse on the green line dividing Nicosia . Also the Turkish invasion spelt economic problems for the club and the fact that it was located in an inner city area next to the green line only made things harder . Up until the late 1990s many traditional Olympiakos supporters out of frustration for the lack of titles either stopped going to games and others switched allegiances to other Nicosia clubs that were richer and could still afford to win titles such as APOEL . It could be said that the club did not transition well from the era of amateur to semi-professional football in Cyprus beginning in the early 1980s mainly for the reasons mentioned above . Also the younger generation of Cypriots did not grow up with Olympiakos as a major power in the Cyprus league and despite their parents supporting Olympiakos they would often choose to support another side that won titles in the 1980 to 2000 years .",
      "In general Olympiakos supporters tend to be of an older age and very rarely engage in trouble with other fans unless severely provoked . They also tend to be right wing politically , although not officially affiliated to any political party , and speak fondly of the time when Olympiakos played with other Greek teams in the Greek First Division .",
      "In the early 2000s , with the shift from semi-professional to professional status in Cyprus football and with a wealthy President at the helm , a brief revival of the club fortunes with an UEFA cup participation , as the club finished second , after 25 years , increased the fans at the New GSP to around 5000 in the two home European games .",
      "Olympiakos fans although now less than those of the other Nicosia , Limassol teams and Anorthosis are nevertheless fiercely loyal to their team . Even when the club fell to the Second Division between 2008 and 2010 due to economic problems , 300 supporters would follow the club to even the most remote village of Cyprus , with home attendance varying between 500 and 750 . At home games now in the First Division around 1000 to 2000 Olympiakos supporters will cheer the team on and are quite demanding for their team due to its past glories , one could say as demanding as other teams that have recently won silverware .",

      "Mannheim Observatory",
      "The Mannheim Observatory was a tower observatory built between 1772 and 1774 in Mannheim , Germany , which remained in operation until 1880 . The observatory was transferred to Karlsruhe and finally in 1898 , was established on the K\u00f6nigstuhl near Heidelberg where todays successor institution the State Observatory Heidelberg-K\u00f6nigstuhl is located .",
      "The observatory tower is now owned by the city and was restored in 1905\u20131906 , and after the Second World War . Since 1958 , the tower houses studio flats .",
      "History .",
      "Schwetzingen .",
      "The Palatinate Elector Karl Theodor was a prince of the Age of Enlightenment . The French thinker Voltaire was a frequent visitor to his Court , the Elector made numerous reforms during his reign and founded scientific institutions . The Physics Institute , established in 1751 in Heidelberg , had as its Professor of Experimental Physics and Mathematics the Jesuit Father Christian Mayer .",
      "In 1756 Mayer was sent to Paris to study the local water supply , he also studied at one of the centres of contemporary astronomy . He was given an Astronomical Quadrant , by the instrument maker , Canivet . In 1759 , he observed the return of the comet predicted by Edmond Halley .",
      "Transit of Venus 1761/1769 .",
      "Mayer observed the Transit of Venus across the Sun on 6 June 1761 from a temporary Observatory built of wood by Karl Theodor in the Orangery in the park of Schwetzingen Castle . The observations convinced the elector as early as July to begin work on an observatory building on the palace roof , which was inaugurated in 1764 .",
      "A few years later , Mayer travelled for a year to St . Petersburg and observed there , another Transit of Venus on 3 June 1769 . The Schwetzinger observatory was not unused , however . Carl Theodor and a visitor , Prince Franz Xavier of Saxony , wished to observe the phenomenon , but were unsuccessful due to bad weather .",
      "Mayer published his results from the two Venus Transits in St . Petersburg and calculated , with the help of his observations of the two transits , that the average Earth-Sun distance was 146.2 million kilometers , which is only three million kilometers less than the actual value , however , with a significant measurement uncertainty .",
      "The Palatinate Period .",
      "The Founding of the Mannheim Observatory .",
      "On New Years Day 1771 Mayer finally presented a memorandum on the construction of an observatory to the Mannheim Court . In 1772 the Elector charged the Court Chamberlain with the construction of the observatory . In the same year the foundation stone of the tower next to Schloss Mannheim , in the vicinity of the Jesuit College was laid . In the following years , Mayer acquired numerous instruments , and with the help of books delivered from the Electoral Library made the Mannheim Observatory into an internationally known research facility .",
      "In the visitors book of the Mannheim observatory not only are there entries by many well-known colleagues , but also illustrious guests such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , Benjamin Franklin , Envoy of the young United States , and even Arabic and other writings .",
      "Mayers astronomical work found its peak in the discovery of binary stars . The majority of the binary stars published in Bodes star chart of 1782 were observed by Mayer .",
      "Elector Karl Theodor left the Palatinate in 1778 , to govern Bavaria . Not least because of the absence of a personal patron prince , the history of the observatory after the death of Christian Mayer in 1783 was less happy .",
      "Christian Mayer\u2019s Successors .",
      "The new Court Astronomer , the Jesuit Karl K\u00f6nig , was transferred to Munich by the Elector Karl Theodor soon after he arrived in Mannheim , the next , the ex-Jesuit John Fischer , made so many enemies that in 1788 after only a year and a half he resigned . The Vincentian priest Peter Ungeschick was probably a better choice , but in 1790 he died on the return journey from studying in Paris . He was followed by Roger Barry , also a member of the Order of Vincentians .",
      "Barrys initial successes were undone by the wars of the Napoleonic Era during which severe damage was inflicted on the Observatory . The tower was repeatedly shelled , instruments were destroyed and others damaged . Some disappeared in unexplained ways . Barry was imprisoned for a time by the French , although he was given the opportunity to observe a Transit of Mercury , but little else .",
      "The Baden Period .",
      "From the Napoleonic Wars to the German Revolution .",
      "After the 1806 war over the Grand Duchy of Badens claims to areas of the Palatinate and thus the observatory , the Court Astronomer , Roger Barry , recommenced his observations , but fell ill in 1810 and the observatory remained unused until his death in 1813 . His numerous observations with the Mural Quadrant made after 1800 remained unpublished by his successors , as they were not classified .",
      "The running of the Mannheim Observatory by Catholic Orders was now over . In the years up to the Baden Revolution in 1848 the observatory declined . Famous astronomers were not retained , such as Heinrich Christian Schumacher ( Director 1813\u20131815 ) , founder of the oldest existing journal of astronomy , Astronomische Nachrichten , and of the Altona Observatory . Friedrich Wilhelm Struve , founder and first director of Pulkovo Observatory at St . Petersburg , despite being interested was deterred by clumsy personnel policy . From 1816 until his death in 1846 Bernhard Nicolai was Court Astronomer , being mainly dedicated to the orbits of comets . In his time , amongst other things , a three-stage refracting telescope was purchased from Fraunhofer , which was later used by the German expeditions of 1874 and 1882 to observe the Transit of Venus .",
      "The instruments and the Observatory Tower itself were aging . Already mature plans for construction of a new observatory drawn up in the revolutionary period were no longer to be , and on 10 June 1850 it was decided to end the Institute by appointing no new Court Astronomer . In 1852 the Heidelberg professor Nell took over the unpaid supervision of the institute . In 1859 this modest institute planned renewal with the purchase of a six-stage telescope .",
      "Move to Karlsruhe .",
      "In 1859 Eduard Sch\u00f6nfeld was appointed Director with a salary . The observatory equipment at his disposal was somewhat antiquated , his largest telescope being a small refractor of 73 lines aperture , but he selected a line of work to suit the instruments at his disposal , observing Nebulae , for which he soon made a name for himself , and variable stars and keeping a watch on comets and new planets .",
      "The results of his observations of nebulae are contained in two catalogues published in the Astronomische Beobachtungen der Grossherzoglichen Sternwarte zu Mannheim , 1st and 2nd parts ( 1862 and 1875 ) , and those of his variable star observations appeared in the Jahresberichte des Mannheimer Vereins f\u00fcr Naturkunde , Nos . 32 and 39 ( 1866 and 1875 ) . His work contributed significantly to the Bonn Survey , a star catalogue still in use today . Moreover , he organized several astronomical meetings . At one such a meeting , 28 August 1863 in Heidelberg , the Astronomische Gesellschaft , the second oldest astronomical society after the Royal Astronomical Society . was founded . Sch\u00f6nfeld was on the founding board . Among many other activities , he was a member of the 1871 Advisory Commission in preparation for the 1874/82 Transits of Venus .",
      "Sch\u00f6nfeld left for Bonn in 1875 and Karl Wilhelm Valentiner took over the Mannheim Directorship . The location of the Observatory in the middle of the town was no longer suitable . The Observatory was moved to a makeshift building in Karlsruhe in 1880 but no significant observations were made . Plans to build a permanent observatory in Karlsruhe did not become a reality , very much to Valentines annoyance , even though the first telescopes and instruments were purchased .",
      "During that time the desire for an observatory arose at the University of Heidelberg . The young Heidelberg astronomer Max Wolf had already built a private observatory in his parents house in 1880 . He believed firmly in the use of photography for observation and as a result he quickly made a name for himself in astronomy .",
      "The Mountain Observatory at Heidelberg .",
      "In 1892 a deputation of Heidelberg professors , amongst them Max Wolf , petitioned the Grand Duke of Karlsruhe for a University research and teaching observatory . This was not financially feasible at that time for Baden which could do little more than construct the buildings , and could not afford the instruments for Wolfs specialisation of astrophotography . Wolf sought supporters for the purchase of new telescopes . The search proved to be very successful : Catherine Wolfe Bruce , the noted American philanthropist and patroness of science , donated $10,000 for a telescope , and this donation was followed by others . Finally , on the construction of an observatory it was granted that the Karlsruhe instruments should be transferred to Heidelberg .",
      "On 20 June 1898 , the Gro\u00dfherzogliche Bergsternwarte at K\u00f6nigstuhl ( the present day Heidelberg Observatory ) was ceremonially inaugurated by Frederick I , Grand Duke of Baden . The astronomical institute comprised two competing departments , the Astrophysics Department under Max Wolf , containing the instruments from his private observatory and the new foundations instruments , and the Astrometry Department under Karl Wilhelm Valentiner , containing the Karlsruhe instruments . Valentiner was director of the Mannheim Observatory and had initiated the move to Karlsruhe . After Valentiners retirement in 1909 , both departments were amalgamated under the administration of Max Wolf .",
      "Wolf worked on many areas of astrophysics , he investigated the structure of the Milky Way , star spectroscopy and gas nebula , and searched intensively for Asteroids , of which he discovered more than 800 . As an honorary citizen of Heidelberg , he was buried in the cemetery on the mountain in 1932 .",
      "After the Second World War , there was a new beginning for the Institute , now named the K\u00f6nigstuhl State Observatory ( LSW ) . In 1983 the Mannheim instruments were donated to the State Museum of Technology and Industry in Mannheim , where some of them now form part of the permanent exhibition . The 1859 six-stage telescope was given to the city of Karlsruhe in 1957 for the establishment of the Public Astronomical Observatory of Karlsruhe , another instrument was given to the National Astronomical Observatory Heppenheim . The valuable book collection of the old library , the oldest of which dates back to 1476 , was transferred to the Manuscript Department of the University Library ."

In the early hours of 21 February , the destroyer collided with the motor vessel Petertoum and suffered some damage .",
      "After undergoing repairs at Plymouth , England , between March and October , Clare resumed convoy duty with Escort Group 41 , Western Approaches Command . Clare was modified for long range trade convoy escort service by removal of the two forward boilers and substitution of additional fuel tanks . This modification improved endurance but reduced top speed to 25 knots . Three of the original /50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts were removed to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog anti-submarine mortars .",

      "Early life .",
      "Raine was born Mary Carter in London on 17 February 1877 to Charles and Mary Carter . She was the oldest of thirteen children .",
      "After finishing school at 14 , she became a probationary teacher in London .",
      "She took singing lessons , and at age 17 found work as a singer , including at Drury Lane and the Adelphi Theatre , which lasted until she lost her ability to sing after a bout of typhoid fever . During this time she continued to work in one of her fathers shops .",
      "After she lost her singing voice , Carter worked at The Scotch House , a boys and mens outfitter , doing clerical work and filling in for sales staff .",
      "Travel to Australia .",
      "By 1900 , Britain was at war with the Boer republics , resulting in financial difficulty for London businesses , including The Scotch House and Charles Carters . Prompted by a desire to improve her lot in life , and a comment from her father about his having to maintain his daughters for the rest of my life , Mary booked a passage to Australia .",
      "In 1900 , at the age of 23 , Carter sailed with her sister Daisy to Moreton Bay in Queensland , Australia , on Jumna , arriving on 20 November . On her arrival in Australia , she had , her lifes savings . Both girls worked as barmaids in Brisbane . Mary also sang at the hotel , and was offered a role in a local theatrical production . However her voice failed her again after a week in the theatre . In 1901 the two sisters moved to Sydney .",
      "Mary Carter was offered a job managing a hotel in Nyngan , but arrived there in 1902 to find that the hotel had no guests , no customers , no stock and no suppliers willing to deliver until outstanding bills were paid . With the help of another new employee , and using some of their own money , Carter bought alcohol by the bottle from a rival hotel , then sold it by the glass from their hotel , making a profit . They repeated the process , until the hotel became a self-sustaining business again . Two years after Carter took over management of the hotel the licensee left town as a result of police investigation into family cruelty . The hotels owner , Reschs Limited , offered Carter the licence , but the liquor licensing laws of the time did not allow an unmarried woman to hold the licence .",
      "Carter return to Sydney , where she met up with Daisy again , and they decided to return to England . The return voyage was to be via Fremantle , Western Australia . On the passage across the Great Australian Bight Daisy suffered from severe sea sickness , and on the advice of the ships doctor they abandoned the voyage , disembarking at Fremantle in 1904 .",
      "Perth , Western Australia .",
      "Carter again found work as a barmaid , at the Metropole Hotel on Hay Street , Perth , and then later at the Central Hotel on the corner of Forrest Place and Wellington Street . In both cases wages included accommodation , so she was able to save a significant portion of her income . With those savings , the \u00a3100 she had brought from England , and a loan for the remainder , she bought a house in Subiaco . She leased that property and used the rental income to pay the loan off within two years . She then bought the vacant block adjacent to her first property , built a house on it and leased it out as well .",
      "Carter maintained her interest in music , and sang as a soloist with the choir at Wesley Church .",
      "On 5 May 1905 , she married William Morris Thomas , becoming Mary Thomas . The couple moved to a farm in Harvey but struggled to make a living . Mary supplemented their farming income by running a small boarding house in nearby Mornington Mills . As well as the financial difficulties they faced , the Thomases relationship was strained by Williams increasing consumption of alcohol \u2013 a problem that had existed since their courtship \u2013 and in 1911 Mary returned to Perth , moving into a house that she had bought before the marriage . The couple did not divorce ; William remained in Harvey , but stayed with her occasionally when he visited Perth . He died in 1918 after falling from a horse .",
      "After returning to Perth in 1911 Mary Thomas took up work as a barmaid again , while continuing to buy and sell ( always for a profit ) property . In 1915 she bought her first business , the Bon Ton Cafe on William Street . The cafe did well , and Thomas soon bought a second one nearby , the Popular Cafe , and employed someone to manage it . She ran the Bon Ton Cafe for eight years , while simultaneously expanding her investment in real estate , including a row of houses in East Perth .",
      "Hotel industry .",
      "In 1924 , Thomas established Metropolitan Properties Ltd , with a capital value of \u00a3100,000 , to manage her real estate portfolio . That same year she bought the Gordons Hotel for \u00a340,000 , half of which she had borrowed , and obtained her first liquor licence . In 1927 she undertook a major refurbishment and expansion of the hotel at a cost of about \u00a327,000 , and in 1928 re-opened it as the Wentworth Hotel . The Wentworth became her home , headquarters and the flagship of her business empire .",
      "She was often known to her customers as Ma Thomas .",
      "Thomas continued to buy properties in the city , including the Bohemia , the United Services Hotel , the Royal Hotel , the Williams Building , Bon March\u00e9 Arcade and the Windsor Hotel in South Perth .",
      "In 1940 Thomas took over the lease of the newly refurbished hotel in Bullsbrook , some from Perth , and renamed it the Chequers Hotel . The business did well , having a virtual monopoly catering to the recently constructed , nearby RAAF Base Pearce , but the distance from Perth made direct supervision difficult , so she surrendered the lease after two years and restricted her hotel businesses to areas closer to the city .",
      "In 1942 , the fighting in World War II was getting closer to Australia , and large contingents of US servicemen began arriving in Perth , including those based in the then-secret Fremantle submarine base . Thomas was informed that the Wentworth Hotel was to be requisitioned by the United States Navy , and she had no choice but to cede control of most of the hotels running to them . This arrangement lasted until the end of the war in 1945 . During the occupation by the US , there were regular fights between Australian and US servicemen , to the extent that in 1943 the Australian Army banned its soldiers from the Wentworth . The ban was lifted a week later , after Thomas wrote to Prime Minister John Curtin and Western Australian Senator Dorothy Tangney .",
      "Marriage to Joe Raine .",
      "On 3 December 1943 , Mary Thomas married Arnold Yeldham ( known as Joe ) Raine , thus becoming Mary Raine ( or colloquially , Ma Raine ) . Joe Raine was a farmer from Manmanning , and a regular guest at the Wentworth when he was in Perth ; they had known each other for several years . Joe moved into the Wentworth with Mary , and also became her business partner .",
      "Medical research funding .",
      "In the mid-1950s , the University of Western Australia launched an appeal for funds to create a medical school , and the Raines were approached directly for a contribution . A donation was made , with the promise of more in future .",
      "In September 1956 Joe suffered a severe stroke caused by arteriosclerosis , resulting in paralysis . After several weeks in hospital , with no sign of recovery , he was moved to a room in the Wentworth Hotel , with a hospital bed and a team of nurses to tend him . On 11 February 1957 he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and died . He was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery . Mary inherited Joes estate , worth \u00a3153,906 , and donated it to the University of Western Australia to establish the Arnold Yeldham and Mary Raine Medical Research Foundation , with the money to be invested and initially used for research into arteriosclerosis .",
      "In 1957 Raine made a new will , leaving small amounts to some friends and family \u2013 she had no children of her own \u2013 with the bulk of her estate to go to the University , for the purposes of finding a cure for the illness that killed Joe . She signed a deed of trust with the University to specify how the estate was to be used after her death , and formalising the donation of Joes estate . At the time of her death , the estate was worth about \u00a31,000,000 , making it one of the largest private donations ever made to an Australian university .",

      "Saadat Hasan Manto",
      "Saadat Hasan Manto ( ; , ; 11 May 1912 \u2013 18 January 1955 ) was a writer , playwright and author born in Ludhiana active in British India and later , after the partition , in Pakistan . Writing mainly in the Urdu language , he produced 22 collections of short stories , a novel , five series of radio plays , three collections of essays and two collections of personal sketches . His best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics . Manto was known to write about the hard truths of society that no one dared to talk about . He is best known for his stories about the partition of India , which he opposed , immediately following independence in 1947 .",
      "Manto was tried for obscenity six times ; thrice before 1947 in British India , and thrice after independence in 1947 in Pakistan , but was never convicted . He is acknowledged as one of the finest 20th century Urdu writers and is the subject of two biographical films : Manto , directed by Sarmad Khoosat and the 2018 film Manto , directed by Nandita Das .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early life .",
      "Saadat Hassan Manto was born in Paproudi village of Samrala , in the Ludhiana district of the Punjab in a Muslim family of barristers on 11 May 1912 . His father was a judge of a local court . He was ethnically a Kashmiri and proud of his roots . In a letter to Pandit Nehru he suggested that being beautiful was the second meaning of being Kashmiri .",
      "The big turning point in his life came in 1933 , at age 21 , when he met Abdul Bari Alig , a scholar and polemic writer who encouraged him to find his true talents and read Russian and French authors .",
      "Early career in Bombay .",
      "Within a matter of months , Manto produced an Urdu translation of Victor Hugos The Last Day of a Condemned Man , which was published by Urdu Book Stall , Lahore as Sarguzasht-e-Aseer ( A Prisoners Story ) . Soon afterwards he joined the editorial staff of Masawat , a daily paper published in Ludhiana .",
      "This heightened enthusiasm pushed Manto to pursue graduation at Aligarh Muslim University , which he joined in February 1934 , and soon got associated with Indian Progressive Writers Association ( IPWA ) . It was here that he met writer Ali Sardar Jafri and found a new spurt in his writing . His second story , Inqlaab Pasand , was published in Aligarh magazine in March 1935 .",
      "In 1934 , Saadat Hasan Manto first came to Bombay ( now Mumbai ) and started to write for magazines , newspapers and writing scripts for the Hindi film industry . During this time , he became good friends with Noor Jehan , Naushad , Ismat Chughtai , Shyam and Ashok Kumar . During this time , he lived in Foras Road , in the center of Bombays red light area of Kamathipura . What he saw then around him had a profound impact on his writings . Subsequently Manto had also accepted the job of writing for Urdu Service of All India Radio in 1941 . This proved to be his most productive period as in the next eighteen months he published over four collections of radio plays , Aao ( Come ) , Manto ke Drame ( Mantos Dramas ) , Janaze ( Funerals ) and Teen Auraten ( Three women ) . He continued to write short stories and his next short story collection Dhuan ( Smoke ) was soon out followed by Manto ke Afsane and his first collection of topical essays , Manto ke Mazamin . This period culminated with the publication of his mixed collection Afsane aur Dramey in 1943 . Meanwhile , due to a quarrel with the director of All India Radio , poet N . M . Rashid , he left his job and returned to Bombay in July 1942 and again started working with film industry . He entered his best phase in screenwriting giving films like Aatth Din , Shikari , Chal Chal Re Naujawan and Mirza Ghalib , which was finally released in 1954 . Some of his short stories also came from this phase including Kaali Shalwar ( 1941 ) , Dhuan ( 1941 ) and Bu ( 1945 ) , which was published in Qaumi Jang ( Bombay ) in February 1945 . Another highlight of his second phase in Bombay was the publication of a collection of his stories , Chugad , which also included the story Babu Gopinath . He stayed in Bombay until he moved to Pakistan in January 1948 after the partition of India in 1947 .",
      "Migration to Pakistan .",
      "As a resident of Bombay , Manto had intended to stay in India after partition . In 1948 , his wife and children went to Lahore to visit their relatives and friends . During this time , as stories of the atrocities of partition riots reached him , in the midst of occasional communal riots in Mumbai itself , he decided to migrate to Pakistan , and left for it by ship . Manto and his family thus found themselves as muhajirs ( refugees from India ) and were among the millions of Muslims who left present-day India for the new Muslim-majority nation of Pakistan .",
      "Life in Lahore .",
      "When Manto arrived in Lahore from Bombay , he associated with several intellectuals at Lahores Pak Tea House . According to one commentator : There was absolutely no external influence and people would share their opinions on any subject without fear even during the military dictators regimes . In Lahore , Manto lived with his wife and family in a room in Lakshmi mansion , located near Butt Tikka . The three storied building was built by Lala Lajpat Rais Lakshmi insurance company in 1938 , inaugurated by Sarojini Naidu , and was at one time the residence of K.Santhanam , an eminent lawyer and the family of a jeweler called Girdharilal . However , it was abandoned during the partition riots of 1947-48 . The mansion is currently dilapidated and uninhabited , though its fa\u00e7ade still exists , renovated and painted .",
      "Death .",
      "In his later years , Manto had become increasingly alcoholic , which eventually led to cirrhosis of the liver . He died on 18 January 1955 , in a mental asylum off Hall Road in Lahore . His death was attributed to the effects of alcoholism . He was survived by his wife Safia and daughters Nighat , Nuzhat and Nusrat . His daughter Nighat Bashir Patel still lives in the vicinity of the house where Manto lived .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Manto was a writer whose life story became a subject of intense discussion and introspection . During the last two decades , many stage productions were done to present his character in conflict with the harsh socio-economic realities of the post-partition era . Danish Iqbals stage Play Ek Kutte Ki Kahani presented Manto in a new perspective on occasion of his birth centenary .",
      "On 18 January 2005 , the fiftieth anniversary of his death , Manto was commemorated on a Pakistani postage stamp . On 14 August 2012 which is Pakistans Independence Day , Saadat Hasan Manto was posthumously awarded the Nishan-e-Imtiaz award ( Distinguished Service to Pakistan Award ) by the Government of Pakistan .",
      "In 2015 , Pakistani actor and director Sarmad Khoosat made and released a movie , Manto , based on the life of Manto . In 2018 , the British Broadcasting Corporation named the work Toba Tek Singh among the 100 stories that shaped the world , alongside works by authors like Homer and Virginia Woolf .",
      "The 2018 film Manto , made by Nandita Das and starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui , is a Bollywood film based on the life of Manto .",
      "On 11 May 2020 , Google celebrated his 108th birthday with a Google Doodle .",
      "Writings .",
      "Manto chronicled the chaos that prevailed , during and after the Partition of India in 1947 . Manto strongly opposed the partition of India , which he saw as an overwhelming tragedy and maddeningly senseless . He started his literary career translating the works of Victor Hugo , Oscar Wilde and Russian writers such as Chekhov and Gorky . His first story was Tamasha , based on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre at Amritsar . Though his earlier works , influenced by the progressive writers of his times , showed a marked leftist and socialist leanings , his later work progressively became stark in portraying the darkness of the human psyche , as humanist values progressively declined around the Partition .",
      "His final works , which grew from the social climate and his own financial struggles , reflected an innate sense of human impotency towards darkness and contained satire that verged on dark comedy , as seen in his final work , Toba Tek Singh . It not only showed the influence of his own demons , but also that of the collective madness that he saw in the ensuing decade of his life . To add to it , his numerous court cases and societal rebukes deepened his cynical view of society , from which he felt isolated .",
      "No part of human existence remained untouched or taboo for him , he sincerely brought out stories of prostitutes and pimps alike , just as he highlighted the subversive sexual slavery of the women of his times . To many contemporary women writers , his language portrayed reality and provided them with the dignity they long deserved . He is still known for his scathing insight into human behaviour as well as revelation of the macabre animalistic nature of the enraged people , that stands out amidst the brevity of his prose .",
      "At least one commentator compares Saadat Hasan Manto to D . H . Lawrence , partly because he wrote about taboos of Indo-Pakistani Society . His concerns on the socio-political issues , from local to global are revealed in his series , Letters to Uncle Sam , and those to Pandit Nehru . On his writing he often commented , If you find my stories dirty , the society you are living in is dirty . With my stories , I only expose the truth .",
      "Controversies .",
      "Conservative critique : charge for obscenity .",
      "Manto faced trial for obscenity in his writings in both India ( then under British rule ) and Pakistan , including three times in India before 1947 ( \u2018Dhuan\u2019 , \u2018Bu\u2019 and \u2018Kali Shalwar\u2019 ) and three times in Pakistan after 1947 ( \u2018Khol Do\u2019 , \u2018Thanda Gosht\u2019 and \u2018Upar Neeche Darmiyaan\u2019 ) under section 292 of the Indian Penal Code ( by the British Government ) and the Pakistan Penal Code in Pakistan\u2019s early years . He was fined only in one case . Regarding the charges of obscenity he opined , I am not a pornographer but a story writer .",
      "Progressive critique : migration to Pakistan .",
      "While the conservative or right-wing section of the society criticised him on moral grounds , the progressives or Marxists and leftists criticised him for ideological reasons , namely for his migration to Pakistan and embrace of Pakistani nationalism , Manto then being championed by traditional minded literary critics such as Hasan Askari and Mumtaz Shirin .",

      "The Spanish East Indies ( ; ) were the overseas territories of the Spanish Empire in Asia and Oceania from 1565 to 1901 , governed from Manila in the Spanish Philippines . The territories included :",
      "- the Captaincy General of the Philippines ( 1565\u20131898 )",
      "- Palaos ( 1574\u20131899 )",

      "The King of Spain traditionally styled himself King of the East and West Indies .",
      "Madrid administered the Spanish East Indies from the Captaincy General of the Philippines which included present-day Philippines , Guam and the Mariana Islands , as well as Palau , part of Micronesia and for a brief period Northern Taiwan and parts of North Sulawesi and the Moluccas . Cebu was the first seat of government , which later transferred to Manila . From 1565 to 1821 these territories , together with the Spanish West Indies , were administered through the Viceroyalty of New Spain based in Mexico City . After Mexican independence , they were ruled directly from Madrid .",
      "As a result of the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898 , the United States of America occupied the Spanish Philippines and Guam , while Spain sold other smaller islands to Germany in the German\u2013Spanish Treaty of 1899 . The few remaining islands were ceded to the United States when the Treaty of Washington was ratified in 1901 .",

      "Spanish contact began on , when a Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan reached the Mariana Islands . He named Guam and the other islands Islas de los Ladrones ( Islands of the Thieves ) because the natives came aboard his galleon ( the Trinidad ) and pilfered many of its supplies . The expedition later continued its journey west and reached the island of Homonhon in the eastern Philippines on , with only 150 crewmen . There they were able to communicate with the local peoples because the Malayan interpreter , Enrique of Malacca , could understand their language . The expedition took them further into the archipelago to the Visayan island of Cebu , where Magellans chaplain , Pedro Valderrama , baptised the local monarch Rajah Humabon ( of the Hindu Cebu Rajahnate ) , his chief consort , and his subjects.Seeking to develop trade between the East Indies and the Americas across the Pacific Ocean , Antonio de Mendoza encouraged the exploration of these Asian territories and commissioned the expedition of Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos to the Philippines in 1542\u20131543 . Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi set out from Mexico , and established the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines in 1565 , which became the town of San Miguel in present-day Cebu . That same year , another member of the expedition , Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta discovered a maritime route from the Philippines to Mexico , across the Pacific , leading to the important transpacific transport link of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons . In 1571 , exploiting a rivalry between the states of Tondo and Maynila , the later being a city-state established by Bruneian Muslim colonists , meant to supplant Tondo , the Spaniards captured Maynila and renamed it into Manila , a former satellite-state of the Brunei Sultanate and then Manila was made the seat of the Spanish Captaincy General of the Philippines . The Hindu Rajahnate of Butuan and the Kedatuans of Dapitan and Madja-as willingly joined the Spaniards to ally against their common Muslim rivals ( Spain recently expelled the Muslims who invaded their homeland at the culmination of the Reconquista ) , Zamboanga was also taken from the Sultanate of Sulu via the efforts of Spanish and Peruvian soldiers and native allies as all these territories were incorporated into the Spanish East Indies . The Philippines became the center of operations for further Spanish wars in Asia including the Castilian War against the Sultanate of Brunei , raids against the Ottoman protectorate of the Sultanate of Aceh , the brief conquests of the Sultanates of Tidor and Ternate as well as Spanish campaigns into Cambodia and Taiwan . These and other Asian territories claimed by the Spanish crown were to be governed from the Viceroyalty of New Spain in Mexico City .",
      "The Manila-Acapulco galleons shipped products gathered from both Asia-Pacific and the Americas , such as silk , spices , silver , gold and other Asian-Pacific islander products to Mexico . Products brought from Asia-Pacific were sent to Veracruz and shipped to Spain and , via trading , to the rest of Europe , while Spanish-Mexican navigators brought with them Hispanic and indigenous Mexican customs , religion , languages , foods , and cultural traditions to the Philippines , Guam , and the Mariana Islands .",
      "In 1606 , the Spaniards established trade links with the Maluku Islands , which continued until 1663 . Contacts with Japan were also established and Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno was sent as ambassador in 1611 , until Japan closed its trading post in 1630 . In northeastern Taiwan , the Spaniards built Fort Santo Domingo near Keelung in 1626 and a mission in Tamsui in 1628 , which they occupied until they lost in the Second Battle of San Salvador . Several Pacific islands were visited by Spanish ships in the 16th century , including New Guinea ( Y\u00f1igo Ortiz de Retez in 1545 ) , the Solomon Islands ( Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa in 1568 ) , and the Marquesas Islands ( \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a de Neira in 1595 ) , but they made no effort to trade with or colonize them .",
      "In 1668 , Blessed Diego Luis de San Vitores established the first mission on Guam , where he and Saint Pedro Calungsod were later martyred .",
      "In 1762 British troops briefly captured the city of Manila during the Seven Years War . However , they were unable to establish control over areas outside Manila\u2014through the efforts of the Spanish lieutenant governor , Sim\u00f3n de Anda y Salazar , the remainder of the islands remained loyal to Spain . The British promised support for an uprising led by Diego Silang and his wife Gabriela but the British force never materialized . Under the peace settlement Manila was exchanged , along with British-occupied Havana , for Florida and Menorca . Manila was ceded back to Spanish authorities in April 1764 .",
      "Colonial government .",
      "The Seven Years War prompted Charles III to initiate extensive governmental reforms throughout the overseas possessions . An intendencia was established in Manila in 1784 to handle the government finances and to promote the economy . ( The plan to introduce more intendencias throughout the Philippines did not materialize. ) In a similar vein , to promote innovation and education among the residents of the islands , Governor-General Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas established the Economic Society of the Friends of the Country .",
      "For over 256 years , the Spanish East Indies were governed by a governor-captain general , and an audiencia . All economic matters of the Philippines were managed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain , located in Mexico . Because the eastward route was more widely used for military purposes , in addition to commerce that included the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade , most government correspondence went through Mexico , rather than directly to Spain ( with the exception of a short period at the end of the 18th century ) .",
      "In 1821 the New Spanish Viceroyalty collapsed following the Mexican War of Independence , which resulted in the First Mexican Empire . All control of the Spanish East Indies government was then transferred to Madrid , until the United States annexed most Spanish territories in the Asia-Pacific region after the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898 .",
      "The Audiencia and Captaincy General .",
      "In 1574 the Captaincy General of the Philippines was created as a dependency of the Viceroyalty of New Spain . The Real Audiencia of Manila was created on and established in 1584 as the highest tribunal of the Spanish Empire in the East Indies , that had the Governor-General of the Philippines as its ex officio highest judge . Both institutions were created by Royal Decree from King Felipe II",
      "Law XI ( Audiencia y Chanciller\u00eda Real de Manila en las Filipinas ) of Title XV ( De las Audiencias y Chancillerias Reales de las Indias ) of Book II of the Recopilaci\u00f3n de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias of 1680\u2014which compiles the original decree and the one of \u2014describes the limits and functions of the Audiencia and its president .",
      "In the city of Manila on the Island of Luzon , Head of the Philippines , shall reside another Royal Audiencia and Chancellery of ours , with a president , who shall be governor and captain general ; four judges of civil cases [ oidores ] , who will also be judges of criminal cases [ alcaldes del crimen ] ; a crown attorney [ fiscal ] ; a bailiff [ alguacil mayor ] ; a lieutenant of the Gran Chancellor ; and the other necessary ministers and officials ; and which shall have for district said Island of Luzon , and the rest of the Philippines , the Archipelago of China , and its Mainland , discovered and to be discovered . And we order that the governor and captain general of said Islands and Provinces , and president of their Royal Audiencia , have exclusively the superior government of the entire district of said Audiencia in war and peace , and shall make provisions and favors in our Royal Name , which in conformity to the laws of this Compilation and the rest of the Kingdoms of Castile and the instructions and powers that We shall grant , he should and can do ; and in gubernatorial matters and cases that shall arise , that are of importance , said president-governor should consult on them with the judges of said Audiencia , so that they give their consultive opinions , and having heard them , he should provide the most convenient to the service of God and ours and the peace and tranquility of said Province and Republic .",
      "Territories .",
      "The Spanish East Indies came to be defined as :",
      "- Las Islas Filipinas ( today the Republic of the Philippines ) : Manila , Luzon , the Visayas , Palawan , Balambangan Island , Northern Mindanao , Zamboanga , Basilan , Jolo , Palmas Islands , Spratly Islands ; including isolated outposts in Keelung , Taiwan , and in the islands of Gilolo , Ternate , and Tidore in the Maluku Islands and Manado in Northern part of Sulawesi ( formerly Celebes ) .",
      "- Islas Carolinas ( the Federated States of Micronesia )",
      "- Islas Marianas ( Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States Territory of Guam )",
      "- Islas Palaos ( Republic of Palau )",
      "The Spanish used several names that are not currently used . Gran Moluca ( Great Molluccas ) for the island of Mindanao and Nueva Castilla ( New Castile ) for Luzon .",
      "Because Spanish interest in the region was primarily focused on its use as a base for trade with East Asia , direct Spanish control over the area expanded slowly . The Batanes Islands were conquered in the 18th century by Jos\u00e9 Basco . The highlands of Luzon remained outside Spanish control until the early 19th century , and the southernmost tip of Palawan , not until the late 1890s . The rest of Mindanao ( Caesarea Karoli ) \u2014aside from outposts in Northern Mindanao , Zamboanga , Cotabato , and the islands of Basilan and Jolo , the rest was nominally under Spanish control , recognizing Spanish rule , but left to administer their own affairs , as in the cases of the Sulu , and the Maguindanao sultanates , as well as a number of other Lumad tribes not affiliated with either . Similarly , Palau and the vast majority of the Caroline Islands were not governed by Spanish missions until the early 19th century .",
      "Cultural influence in the former Spanish East Indies .",
      "Hispanic .",
      "Spains influence on its former territories in Asia-Pacific is significant to this day . The majority of the people of the Philippines , Guam and the Mariana Islands belong to the Roman Catholic faith which was introduced by Spanish missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries . A large part of the population in these countries use Spanish names and surnames . Also , because of the introduction of new tools , products , crops and technology by Spaniards and Mexicans in the three centuries of colonial rule , many Spanish loanwords entered the native languages of these countries . Art forms such as music , architecture and fashion also have much Spanish influence . The national cuisines of these countries also have Mexican and Spanish elements . In terms of ethnicity , the inhabitants of these territories ( 1/3rd of Luzon islands population and port-cities and military outposts , mainly Iloilo , Cebu , Legaspi , Vigan and Zamboanga etc. ) are descendants of Latin American and Spanish settlers . These descendants of mixed heritage are known as mestizos .",
      "Filipino .",
      "A sizeable proportion of the current population of the Northern Marianas Islands ( 45\u201355% ) and Guam ( 30\u201345% ) , as well as that of Palau ( 15\u201325% ) is of Filipino descent . Some of the local peoples in the previously stated territories also use Filipino names and surnames ( one example is the surname Pangelinan , which comes from the Filipino surname Pangilinan ) . The current Chamorro population is believed to be partly of Filipino descent , both because of the historic links between Guam , and the Northern Mariana Islands and the Philippines during Spanish rule , and currently through different waves of migration . The cuisines of Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , and Palau are also heavily influenced by Filipino cuisine , with dishes like Pancit , Lumpia , Kelaguen , Halo-halo and Okoy being the most noticeable ."

The USA Sevens was introduced in 2004 , originally in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson , California . The event moved to San Diego in 2007 , and from there moved to Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas in 2010 . It then spent the entire decade of the 2010s in Las Vegas before returning to Carson in 2020 . The USA Sevens tournament features 16 teams representing countries from every inhabited continent , including the host , the U.S . national team .",
      "The USA Sevens is the fifth of ten tournaments on the World Rugby Sevens Series . The Sevens World Series is played throughout the world at nine other venues : Dubai , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , Hong Kong , Singapore , Canada , France , and England .",
      "Format .",
      "The tournament consists of 16 countries participating in 45 matches over a three-day weekend . The 16 teams are divided into four pools of four teams , with seeding determined by finishes in the previous competition in the Sevens World Series . Wins are worth three points , draws two , and losses one . The top two teams from each group progress to the quarterfinals to compete for the Cup ( places 1-4 ) and Plate ( places 5-8 ) . The bottom two teams from each group participate in the Bowl ( places 9-12 ) and Shield ( places 13-16 ) competitions .",
      "Through the 2011\u201312 edition , the sixteen participating teams were the 12 core members of the Sevens World Series circuit , along with 4 additional qualifying teams\u2014other teams that qualified multiple times during the 2009\u20132012 span included Japan , Canada , Uruguay and Guyana . Starting with the 2012\u201313 season , the number of core teams increased from 12 to 15 , with Canada , Spain and Portugal earning the three new slots .",
      "Popularity and Growth .",
      "The USA Sevens is the 2nd largest annual rugby competition in North America after the Vancouver 7s in Canada The tournament has grown in popularity since the tournament began in 2004 . In recent years , a number of events have accelerated the surge in popularity , including the announcement in 2009 that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics , the general growth of rugby in the United States , the improved performance of the U.S . national rugby team including their success in reaching the semi-finals of the 2009 USA Sevens , and NBCs decision to begin televising the tournament beginning in 2011 .",
      "Attendance .",
      "Tournament attendance has grown rapidly since its inception in 2004 . The tournament drew 15,800 fans in 2004 , 25,000 fans in 2007 , 35,773 in 2008 , and 37,000 fans in 2009 .",
      "The tournament switched to a three-day format in 2011 . The 2012 tournaments second-day attendance of 30,112 set a new record for the largest crowd to watch a rugby event in the United States . The 2013 tournament broke attendance records again , with total attendance of 67,341 . The 2014 tournament again saw record attendance , with 68,608 fans , despite the fact that the tournament had been moved to January to avoid the 2014 Winter Olympics .",
      "Media coverage .",
      "The profile and visibility of the USA Sevens has increased in the United States since NBC began broadcasting the tournament in 2011 , marking the first time that the tournament had live television coverage on network TV in the United States . NBC Sports and Universal Sports broadcast eight hours of live coverage of the 2011 tournament , including 4 hours of coverage on NBC . NBC increased its television coverage for the 2012 tournament , showing 10 hours of live coverage , including 4 hours on NBC and 4 hours on NBC Sports .

NBC Sports has recognized that its partnership with USA Sevens to broadcast the tournament will help grow the sport of rugby in the United States .",
      "Sponsors .",
      "Fueled in part by the publicity generated by the NBC broadcasts and rugbys return to the Olympics , the USA Sevens has been successful in lining up several blue-chip corporate sponsors . For the 2011 tournament , sponsors included Bridgestone , Toyota , Subway and ADT . The tournament was similarly successful in landing commercial sponsors for 2012 , including Adidas , Pepsi , DHL , Subway and others .",
      "Effective with the 2010\u201311 series , the London-based global financial services company HSBC became the title sponsor of the overall IRB Sevens World Series .",
      "History .",
      "The USA Sevens tournament has been a part of the World Rugby Sevens Series every year since its 2004 debut . This makes the USA Sevens tournament one of the longer running consecutive hosts on the circuit .",
      "The USA Sevens debuted at the Home Depot Center , now known as Dignity Health Sports Park , in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson , California in February 2004 . This competition marked the first time the United States ever hosted an official IRB event of international importance . USA Rugby was awarded the right to host the USA Sevens for three years , in part because rugby was recognized as one of the fastest growing team sports in the U.S .",
      "In 2005 , USA Rugby sold a 90% interest in USA Sevens , LLC to United World Sports , LLC , with USA Rugby retaining the remaining 10% ownership interest . In August 2006 , USA Rugby and the International Rugby Board renewed the contract for the USA Sevens to remain in the IRB Sevens World Series .",
      "The USA Sevens tournament was held from 2007 to 2009 in San Diego at Petco Park , the home field of the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball . San Diego was an appealing location because the average high temperature in San Diego in February is a balmy 72 \u00b0F ( 22 \u00b0C ) .",
      "Las Vegas then won the right to host the annual event beginning in 2010 , beating out competition from San Francisco , Phoenix , and Orlando . In 2015 , World Rugby reached an agreement with USA Rugby and with the tournaments organizers : World Rugby would continue to place the USA Sevens tournament in Las Vegas if the tournament organizers agreed to widen the field at Sam Boyd Stadium and install approved artificial turf .",
      "The USA Sevens was a financial success during its run in Las Vegas , partly because its venue of Sam Boyd Stadium was surrounded by playing fields . This allowed the complex to host the Las Vegas Invitational , a major rugby union event involving club , school , and university teams , alongside the USA Sevens . During the USA Sevens run in Las Vegas , the entry fee for the Invitational has included tickets to the USA Sevens , providing a large built-in attendance base .",
      "In 2017 , the Oakland Raiders were given permission by the NFL to relocate to Las Vegas , with the team to play in a new 60,000-capacity stadium on a plot of derelict land near the Las Vegas Strip . Due to the fact that $750 million of the construction costs was expected to come in the form of public funding , a deal was thrashed out to allow the UNLV Rebels football team of the local University of Nevada , Las Vegas to move in as co-tenants of the new stadium . This meant that Sam Boyd Stadium faces an uncertain future with multiple sources suggesting that it would be demolished . In March 2018 , United World Sports CEO Jon Prusmack stated his intention on initiating talks with the Raiders over the next few months to allow the USA Sevens to use the new Raiders stadium for future tournaments .",
      "In January 2019 , The Province , the main newspaper in Vancouver , reported that the then-upcoming 2019 USA Sevens would be the last in Las Vegas , at least for the immediate future . At the time , World Rugby was preparing to announce the hosts for the Sevens Series events for its next four-year cycle , starting with 2019\u201320 and running through 2022\u201323 . Reasons cited were stadium issues and poor living environment at the team hotels . Possible options were a return to San Diego , or moves to San Francisco ( which hosted the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens ) or Miami . WR ultimately announced that the event would return to its original home of Dignity Health Sports Park for at least the 2020 event .",
      "Apart from the uncertain future of Sam Boyd Stadium , its playing field had been the source of many issues . During the first years of the events run in Las Vegas , the stadiums standard artificial pitch was used , leading to many safety-related concerns . Some of these concerns were alleviated with the installation of temporary grass surfaces for the 2017\u20132019 events , but other safety issues inherent to the stadiums design remained . Sam Boyd Stadium was built for American football , a sport with a playing field ( including the end zones ) that is approximately the same length as a standard rugby pitch but is nearly 20 meters narrower . Because of this , the pitch in Las Vegas was noticeably narrower than at other series stops , with team benches unusually close to the touchlines .",

      "Exxon Valdez",
      "Oriental Nicety , formerly Exxon Valdez , Exxon Mediterranean , SeaRiver Mediterranean , S/R Mediterranean , Mediterranean , and Dong Fang Ocean , was an oil tanker that gained notoriety after running aground in Prince William Sound spilling its cargo of crude oil into the sea . On March 24 , 1989 , while owned by the former Exxon Shipping Company , and captained by Joseph Hazelwood and First Mate James Kunkel bound for Long Beach , California , the vessel ran aground on the Bligh Reef resulting in the second largest oil spill in United States history . The size of the spill is estimated to have been , or 257,000 to 750,000 barrels . In 1989 , the Exxon Valdez oil spill was listed as the 54th largest spill in history .",
      "Carrier .",
      "The tanker was 301 meters long , 51 meters wide , and 26 meters deep ( 987 ft x 166 ft x 88 ft ) , with a deadweight of 214,861 long tons and a full-load displacement of 240,291 long tons . The ship was able to transport up to 235,000 m\u00b3 ( 1.48 million barrels ) at a sustained speed of 16.25 knots , powered by a ( 31,650 shp ) diesel engine . Her hull design was of the single-hull type , constructed by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company in San Diego , California . She was a relatively new tanker at the time of the spill , having been delivered to Exxon on December 16 , 1986 .",
      "Incident and accidents .",
      "Oil spill .",
      "At the time of the spill , Exxon Valdez was employed to transport crude oil from the Alyeska consortiums pipeline terminal in Valdez , Alaska , to the lower 48 states of the United States . At the time it ran aground , the vessel was carrying about 201,000 m\u00b3 ( 53.1 million gallons ) of oil . After the spill , the vessel was towed to San Diego , arriving on June 10 , 1989 , and repairs were started on June 30 , 1989 . Approximately 1,600 tons of steel were removed and replaced that July , totaling US$30 million of repairs to the tanker . Its single-hull design remained unaltered .",
      "The Exxon Valdez spill occurred under President George H . W . Bush , whose EPA Administrator William K . Reilly played a significant role in mobilizing presidential support for action to contain and clean up the spill .",
      "Litigation .",
      "Litigation was filed on behalf of 38,000 litigants . In 1994 , a jury awarded plaintiffs US$287 million in compensatory damages and US$5 billion in punitive damages . Exxon appealed and the Ninth Circuit Court reduced the punitive damages to US$2.5 billion . Exxon then appealed the punitive damages to the Supreme Court which capped the damages to US$507.5 million in June , 2008 . On August 27 , 2008 , Exxon Mobil agreed to pay 75% of the US$507.5 million damages ruling to settle the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska .",
      "In June 2009 , a federal ruling ordered Exxon to pay an additional US$480 million in interest on their delayed punitive damage awards .",
      "Return to service .",
      "After repairs , Exxon Valdez was renamed Exxon Mediterranean , then SeaRiver Mediterranean in the early 1990s , when Exxon transferred its shipping business to a new subsidiary company , River Maritime Inc . The name was later shortened to S/R Mediterranean , then to simply Mediterranean in 2005 . Although Exxon tried briefly to return the ship to its North American fleet , it was prohibited by law from returning to Prince William Sound . It then served in Europe , the Middle East and Asia . In 2002 , the ship was again removed from service . In 2005 , it began operating under the Marshall Islands flag of convenience . Since then , European Union regulations have also prevented vessels with single-hull designs such as the Valdez from entering European ports . In early 2008 , SeaRiver Maritime , an ExxonMobil subsidiary , sold Mediterranean to the Hong Kong-based shipping company , Hong Kong Bloom Shipping Ltd. , which renamed the ship , once again , to Dong Fang Ocean ( ) , under Panama registry . In 2008 , she was refitted and converted from an oil tanker to an ore carrier .",
      "Hong Kong Bloom Shipping , is a subsidiary of Chinese Government owned company China Ocean Shipping ( Group ) Corporation ( COSCO ) .",
      "Collision with MV Aali .",
      "On November 29 , 2010 , Dong Fang Ocean collided in the South China Sea with the Malta-flagged cargo ship , Aali . Both vessels were severely damaged in the incident , and Aali was towed to Weihai and Dong Fang Ocean was towed to Longyan Port in Shandong .",
      "Retirement .",
      "In March 2012 , Dong Fang Ocean was purchased by Global Marketing Systems , Inc . for scrap at an estimated US$16 million and sailed under her own power to a ship breaker in Singapore . She changed hands again among scrap merchants ( a common occurrence ) and was eventually routed to Alang , India , under the ownership of Priya Blue Industries and at some point renamed Oriental Nicety . Before being beached , some tried to halt the action , arguing that the vessel was in breach of the Basel Convention . On 30 July 2012 , the Supreme Court of India granted permission for the owners of Oriental Nicety to beach her at Gujarat coast to be dismantled . She was then beached at Alang on 2 August 2012 .",

      "M ( James Bond )",
      "M is a fictional character in Ian Flemings James Bond book and film series ; the character is the Head of the Secret Intelligence Service\u2014also known as MI6 . Fleming based the character on a number of people he knew who commanded sections of British intelligence . M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors , as well as appearing in twenty-four films . In the Eon Productions series of films , M has been portrayed by four actors : Bernard Lee , Robert Brown , Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes , the incumbent ; in the two independent productions , M was played by John Huston , David Niven and Edward Fox .",
      "Background .",
      "Fleming based much of Ms character on Rear Admiral John Godfrey , who was Flemings superior at the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War . After Flemings death , Godfrey complained He turned me into that unsavoury character , M .",
      "Other possible inspirations include Lieutenant Colonel Sir Claude Dansey , the deputy head of MI6 and head of the wartime Z network , who achieved different interpretations of his character from those who knew him : Malcolm Muggeridge thought him the only professional in MI6 , while Hugh Trevor-Roper considered Dansey to be an utter shit , corrupt , incompetent , but with a certain low cunning . A further inspiration for M was Maxwell Knight , the head of MI5 , who signed his memos as M and whom Fleming knew well . The tradition of the head of MI6 signing their name with a single letter came from Mansfield Smith-Cumming , who would sign his initial C navy-style , with green ink .",
      "Another possibility for the model of M was William Melville , an Irishman who became the head of the Secret Service Bureau , the forerunner of both MI5 and MI6 : Melville was referred to within government circles as M . Melville recruited Sidney Reilly into government service and foiled an assassination plot against Queen Victoria on her 1887 Golden Jubilee . Flemings biographer John Pearson also hypothesised that Flemings characterisation of M reflects memories of his mother :",
      "Novels .",
      "Flemings third Bond novel , Moonraker , establishes Ms initials as M**** M******* and his first name is subsequently revealed to be Miles . In the final novel of the series , The Man with the Golden Gun , Ms full identity is revealed as Vice Admiral Sir Miles Messervy KCMG ; Messervy had been appointed to head of MI6 after his predecessor had been assassinated at his desk .",
      "A naval theme runs throughout Flemings description of M and his surroundings , and his character was described by journalist Ben Macintyre as every inch the naval martinet . Macintyre wrote that in his study of Flemings work , Kingsley Amis outlined the way Fleming had described Ms voice , being : angry ( three times ) ; brutal , cold ( seven times ) ; curt , dry ( five times ) ; gruff ( seven times ) ; stern , testy ( five times ) .",
      "Over the course of twelve novels and two collections of short stories , Fleming provided a number of details relating to Ms background and character . In On Her Majestys Secret Service it is revealed that Ms pay as head of the Secret Service is \u00a36,500 a year , ( \u00a3 in 2021 pounds ) \u00a31,500 of which comes from retired naval pay . Although his pay is good for the 1950s and 1960s , it is never explained how M received or can afford his membership at Blades , an upscale private club for gentlemen he frequents in London to gamble and dine . Blades has a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen and all must be able to show \u00a3100,000 ( \u00a3 in 2021 pounds ) in cash or gilt-edged securities . Kingsley Amis noted in his study , The James Bond Dossier , that on Ms salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling . As a personal favour to M , the staff at Blades keeps a supply of cheap red wine from Algeria on hand but does not include it on the wine list . M refers to it as Infuriator and tends only to drink it in moderate quantities unless he is in a very bad mood .",
      "The academic Paul Stock argues that Ms office is a metonym for England and a stable point from which Bond departs on a mission , whilst he sees M as being an iconic representative of England and Englishness .",
      "In the first post-Fleming book , Colonel Sun , M is kidnapped from Quarterdeck , his home , and Bond goes to great lengths to rescue him . The later continuation books , written by John Gardner , retain Sir Miles Messervy as M , who protects Bond from the new , less aggressive climate in the Secret Service , saying that at some point Britain will need a blunt instrument . In Gardners final novel , COLD , M is kidnapped and rescued by Bond and finishes the book by retiring from MI6 . Continuation Bond author Raymond Bensons 1998 novel The Facts of Death continued Messervys retirement , where he still resides in Quarterdeck . The book also introduces a new M , Barbara Mawdsley .",

      "M was played by Bernard Lee from the first Bond film , Dr . No , until Moonraker ( 1979 ) . In Dr . No , M refers to his record of reducing the number of operative casualties since taking the job , implying someone else held the job recently before him . The film also saw M refer to himself as head of MI7 ; Lee had originally said MI6 , but was overdubbed with the name MI7 prior to the films release . Earlier in the film , the department had been referred to as MI6 by a radio operator .",
      "A number of Bond scholars have noted that Lees interpretation of the character was in line with the original literary representation ; Cork and Stutz observed that Lee was very close to Flemings version of the character , while Rubin commented on the serious , efficient , no-nonsense authority figure . Smith and Lavington , meanwhile , remarked that Lee was the very incarnation of Flemings crusty admiral .",
      "Lee died of cancer in January 1981 , four months into the filming of For Your Eyes Only and before any of his scenes could be filmed . Out of respect , no new actor was hired to assume the role and , instead , the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave , with his lines given to either his Chief of Staff Bill Tanner or the Minister of Defence , Sir Frederick Gray . Later films referred to Lees tenure as head of the service , with a painting of him as M in MI6s Scottish headquarters during the 1999 instalment The World Is Not Enough .",

      "Robert Brown : 1983\u20131989 .",
      "After Lees death in 1981 , in the thought to recast M , some minds went to Ralph Truman , the supporting actor who brought distinguished bearing to many an authority figure , quickly quashed as he had died in 1977 . The actor the producers hired to play M in Octopussy was Robert Brown . At the time of the films release , the general thought was that this was the same M whom Lee had played , but was now being played by Brown , in the same way that Roger Moore and George Lazenby had replaced Sean Connery . Brown , however , had previously played Admiral Hargreaves , Flag Officer Submarines , in the 1977 film , The Spy Who Loved Me and Bond scholars Steven Jay Rubin , John Cork , and Collin Stutz all consider Admiral Hargreaves would have been appointed to the role of M , rather than Brown playing either the same M as Lee , or even a different character altogether .",
      "Pfeiffer and Worrall considered that whilst Brown looks perfect , the role had been softened from that of Lee ; they also considered him far too avuncular , although in Licence to Kill they remarked that he came across as being very effective as he removed Bonds double-0 licence . Continuation author Raymond Benson agrees , noting that the M role was once again under written , and Brown is not allowed the opportunity to explore and reveal his character traits ; Benson also considered the character to be too nice .",

      "After the long period between Licence to Kill and GoldenEye , the producers brought in Dame Judi Dench to take over as the new M replacing Robert Brown . The character is based on Stella Rimington , the real-life head of MI5 between 1992 and 1996 . For GoldenEye , Denchs M is cold , blunt and initially dislikes Bond , whom she calls a sexist , misogynist dinosaur , a relic of the Cold War . Tanner , her Chief of Staff , refers to her during the film as the Evil Queen of Numbers , given her reputation at that stage for relying on statistics and analysis rather than impulse and initiative .",
      "Following Pierce Brosnans departure from the role as Bond , Dench continued playing M for the 2006 film Casino Royale , which rebooted the series with Daniel Craig playing Bond at the beginning of his career . In this new continuity , M has worked for MI6 for some time , at one point muttering , Christ , I miss the Cold War . According to Skyfall , M was previously in charge of MI6s operations in Hong Kong during the 1990s . Her ability to run MI6 has been questioned more than once ; in Casino Royale , she is the subject of a review when Bond is caught shooting an unarmed prisoner and blowing up a foreign embassy on camera ; in Quantum of Solace , the Foreign Secretary orders her to personally withdraw Bond from the field in Bolivia and to stop any investigations into Dominic Greenes eco-terrorist organisation ; and in Skyfall , she is the subject of a public inquiry when MI6 loses a computer hard drive containing the identities of undercover agents around the world . Skyfall marked Denchs seventh appearance as M , where she is targeted by former MI6 agent Raoul Silva , whom she turned over to the Chinese in order to save six other agents . She is shot and killed in the film , making her the only M to die in the Eon Bond films . Denchs M makes a final appearance in Spectre in a video will , giving Bond a final order to hunt down and terminate someone , which ultimately leads him to the films titular criminal organisation .",
      "There have also been brief references to Ms family : in GoldenEye , she responds to Tanner calling her the Evil Queen of Numbers by telling him that when she wants to hear sarcasm she will listen to her children . Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster suggested that Denchs casting gave the character maternal overtones in her relationship with Bond , overtones made overt in Skyfall , in which Silva repeatedly refers to her as Mother and Mommy . In Skyfall she is revealed to be a widow ; in Casino Royale she is shown briefly in bed when she takes a call from MI6 ; there is a man sleeping beside her who was presumably her husband .",

Foxs M is very notably younger than all of the previous portrayals , and indeed his portrayal is the only instance \u2015 to date \u2015 of the actor playing M being younger than the actor playing Bond .

      "James Parmentier",
      "James Parmentier ( 1658 \u2013 2 December 1730 ) , also known as Jacques Parmentier was a French painter who spent much of his career in England , partly in London and partly in Yorkshire .",
      "Life .",
      "Parmentier was born in France in 1658 . He initially studied art under his uncle , S\u00e9bastien Bourdon , who died in 1671 . After some further instruction from another relation , Parmentier went to England in September 1676 , to work under the decorative painter Charles de La Fosse , who was then painting the ceilings at Montagu House in Bloomsbury . He came to the attention of William III , who sent him to work at his palace of Het Loo in Holland , but his employment there came to a premature end following a dispute with Daniel Marot , then surveyor of the royal palaces in Holland . While in the Netherlands Parmentier painted the ceiling and two chimney-pieces in the chief room of the royal palace at Binnenhof . He was a member of the guild of St Luke at The Hague , becoming a master on 1 December 1698 .",
      "Parmentier returned to London , but unable to find sufficient patronage there , he accepted an invitation to go to Yorkshire , where he painted many portraits . In 1711 he was paid \u00a350 to paint an altarpiece showing the Last Supper for the church of the Holy Trinity Church at Hull . It survives , although in a mutilated condition . He also executed a ceiling painting on the theme of Moses receiving the law for St . Peters Church at Leeds , and decorated staircases at Worksop Manor for the Duke of Norfolk , and at the house of John Atkinson , a former mayor of Leeds .",
      "Following the death of Louis Laguerre in 1721 Parmentier returned to London , hoping to succeed to his practice as a decorative painter . During this London sojourn he became a member of a masonic music club called the Philo-musicae et -architecturae societas Apollini , which met at the Queens Head tavern on Fleet Street near Temple Bar . Parmentier may have been hoping that freemasonry might provide a viable source of patronage for him , and it is known that he did get some work through the club , as its minute-book records that when the tavern changed its name to the Apollo tavern in recognition of its musical clientele , Parmentier painted the new sign . He did not , however , achieve his hoped-for success in London , and was on the point of returning to the Netherlands , where he had been invited to spend the rest of his life with relatives at Amsterdam , when he died on 2 December 1730 . He was buried in St Pauls , Covent Garden .",
      "His paintings of Charles II and of Charles de Marquetel de Saint-Evremond are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery , London ; another of St Evremond ( 1701 ) is at Knole .",

      "Early life .",
      "Stacy Ann Fergie Ferguson was born in Hacienda Heights , California , to Terri ( n\u00e9e Gore ) and Jon Patrick Ferguson . Her ancestry includes English , Irish , Mexican , and Scottish . She has a younger sister named Dana Ferguson . She was raised Roman Catholic and attended Mesa Robles Middle School and Glen A . Wilson High School . She was a cheerleader , straight-A student , spelling bee champion , and Girl Scout .",
      "Career .",
      "1984\u20132002 : Television , acting and Wild Orchid .",
      "Fergie studied dance and began to do voiceover work ; she provided the voice for Sally in two made-for-television Peanuts cartoons , Its Flashbeagle , Charlie Brown ( 1984 ) and Snoopys Getting Married , Charlie Brown ( 1985 ) , as well as on four episodes of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show . From 1984 to 1989 , she starred on the TV show Kids Incorporated and was the longest running cast member ; she starred in the first six of the shows nine seasons . Fergie was a member of the female trio Wild Orchid , which she fronted with Stefanie Ridel and fellow Kids Incorporated star Renee Sandstrom . By 1992 , the girls began meeting with record labels , but they still could not get a recording contract . They eventually signed a music publishing deal with Sony Publishing before signing a record contract with RCA Records in 1994 . In April 2007 , she gave an interview in which she admitted that she went on a sex and drugs spree when she turned eighteen , saying : I have had lesbian experiences in the past . I wont say how many men Ive had sex with\u2014but I am a very sexual person .",
      "Wild Orchid released their self-titled debut album in March 1997 , which debuted at #153 on the Billboard 200 . In September 1998 , they released their second album , Oxygen , which was a commercial failure , only selling 200,000 copies worldwide . From June 16 to August 28 , 1999 , they opened for Chers Do You Believe ? tour alongside Cyndi Lauper , which took them to 52 cities across the United States and Canada . They completed a third album , which their record label declined to release , and Fergie left the group in September 2001 . In 2006 , Fergie told Entertainment Weekly that both frustrations with the bands image and personal drug problems led her to leave Wild Orchid .",
      "2003\u20132006 : Success with the Black Eyed Peas .",
      "The Black Eyed Peas were recording their third album , Elephunk ( 2003 ) , when will.i.am invited Fergie to try out for a song called Shut Up . She secured the gig and instantly bonded with the trio , going on to record five additional songs on the album . The following spring , shortly before Elephunk came out , Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine offered Fergie a permanent spot to take over vocal duties and fill the void left by background singer Kim Hills departure in 2000 . In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas new-found style , Rolling Stone noted that since 2002 , when the group hired a blond bombshell named Stacy Fergie Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred , they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs \u2013 a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their United Colors of Benetton worldview . From Elephunk came Where is the Love? , which became the Black Eyed Peas first major hit : it peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in several other countries . The album subsequently spawned Shut Up , which topped the charts in many markets . The third single from the album , Hey Mama , reached the top 10 in several European countries and later peaked at number twenty-three in the United States in 2004 .",
      "Their next album , Monkey Business , was released on June 7 , 2005 , and debuted at number two on the U.S . Billboard 200 albums chart , selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA . Their next and last commercially released single from the album was Pump It , which borrows much of its sound from Misirlou , specifically Dick Dales version ; it peaked at number 8 in Australia but 18 in America . The albums first single , Dont Phunk with My Heart , was a hit in the United States , reaching number three on the U.S . Hot 100 and earned them another Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group . Dont Lie , the second single from the album , saw success on the U.S . Hot 100 , reaching No . 14 , although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia , reaching a peak of No.6 in both countries . My Humps , another song from the album , immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S . and fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics , reaching number three on the U.S . Hot 100 and number one in Australia , making it their fourth Australian number one single . However , many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content ; John Bush , writing for AllMusic , described it as one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium . Later in 2005 , the Black Eyed Peas toured with Gwen Stefani , as supporting act . In December 2005 , they embarked on the European Tour . In March 2006 , the Black Eyed Peas toured again , as the featured headliner for the Honda Civic Tour .",

      "The general structure and operational methods of SBU appear to be very similar to that of its predecessor ( KGB of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic ) with exception of Ukrainian Border Guards and department responsible for security of high-rank state officials . Both of them became independent institutions . However the SBU keeps under control special operation units Alpha with bases in every Ukrainian province . According to British political expert Taras Kuzio the organizational structure of SBU remains to be as bloated in size as the Soviet Ukrainian KGB because the total number of active officers as high as 30,000 . It is six times larger than British domestic MI5 and external MI6 combined together .",

      "On 14 January 1918 the Ukrainian Peoples Republic founded its Security Services .",
      "In May 1918 the Department of the State Guard of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Ukrainian State started to form a new intelligence service . This was a much more effective agency than its predecessor due to the incorporation of former employees of Okhrana ( the secret police force of the Russian Empire ) . After the fall of the Ukrainian State and the return of power of the Ukrainian Peoples Republic ( UNR ) in December 1918 , the new UNR authorities destroyed virtually all of the state infrastructure of the Ukrainian State . Therefore , the new secret services founded in January 1919 ( with two divisions - domestic and foreign ) had to start practically from scratch . It never became as well lead , nor successful , as the security services of the Ukrainian State . The security services of the West Ukrainian Peoples Republic on the other hand were well-organized . The West Ukrainian Peoples Republic were formed in March 1919 as the Field Gendarmerie of the Ukrainian Galician Army ( it also served as military police ) . There was no cooperation between the West Ukrainian Peoples Republic and Ukrainian Peoples Republic security services .",
      "In 1924 former ( April\u2013July 1919 ) head of intelligence of the Ukrainian Peoples Republic Mykola Chebotarov started intelligence work on his own initiative for the Ukrainian Peoples Republic government in exile on the territory of the Ukrainian SSR .",
      "Soviet era .",
      "The All-Ukrainian Cheka was formed on December 3 , 1918 in Kursk on the initiative from Yakov Sverdlov and Lenins orders . The commission was formed on the decree of the Provisional Workers and Peasants Government of Ukraine and later adopted on May 30 , 1919 by the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee . To support the Soviet government in Ukraine , in Moscow was formed a corps of special assignment with 24,500 soldiers as part of the All-Ukrainian Cheka . In spring 1919 there was created the Council in fight against counterrevolution and consisted of Adolph Joffe , Stanislav Kosior , and Martin Latsis . In its early years the security agency fought against the kulak-nationalistic banditry ( peasants who resisted having their land confiscated and being forced into collective farms ) . On August 19 , 1920 the All-Ukrainian Cheka arrested all members of the All-Ukrainian Conference of Mensheviks after accusing them in counterrevolution . On December 10 , 1934 the State Political Directorate of Ukraine was dissolved , becoming part of the NKVD of Ukraine .",
      "1990s\u20132005 .",
      "The SBU is a successor of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics Branch of the Soviet KGB , keeping the majority of its 1990s personnel . Many of whom came from the KGBs 5th directorate . It was created in September 1991 following the August 1991 independence of Ukraine . The last Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics Branch head Colonel-General Nikolai Golushko stayed on as chairman of the newly formed Security Service of Ukraine for four months before moving to Russia . ( Golushko headed the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service in Golushko in 1993 and 1994. )",
      "Since 1992 , the agency has been competing in intelligence functions with the intelligence branch of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense . Despite this , a former Military Intelligence Chief and career GRU technological espionage expert , Ihor Smeshko , served as an SBU chief until 2005 .",
      "According to Taras Kuzio during the 1990s in some regions of Ukraine ( Donetsk ) the SBU teamed up with local criminals taking part in privatization of state property ( so-called prykhvatizatsiya ) ignoring its operational objectives and sky-rocketing level of local violence . A notorious incident took place in December 1995 in Western Ukraine when a local citizen Yuriy Mozola was arrested by SBU agents , interrogated and brutally tortured for three days . He refused to confess in trumped up murder charges and died in SBU custody . Later it turned out that the real killer was Anatoly Onoprienko . He was arrested the next year .",
      "Reports of SBU involvement in arms sales abroad began appearing regularly in the early 2000s . Ukrainian authorities have acknowledged these sales and arrested some alleged participants .",
      "In 2004 , the SBUs Intelligence Department was reorganized into an independent agency called Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine . It is responsible for all kinds of intelligence as well as for external security . As of 2004 , the exact functions of the new service , and respective responsibilities of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine were not regulated yet . On November 7 , 2005 the President of Ukraine created the Ukraine State Service of special communications and protection of information , also known as Derzhspetszvyazok ( StateSpecCom ) in place of one of the departments of SBU and making it an autonomous agency . The SBU subsumed the Directorate of State Protection of Ukraine ( ) , the personal protection agency for the most senior government officials , which was the former Ninth Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB .",
      "The SBUs State Directorate of Personal Protection is known for its former Major Mykola Melnychenko , the communications protection agent in President Leonid Kuchmas bodyguard team . Melnychenko was the central figure of the Cassette Scandal ( 2000 ) \u2014one of the main events in Ukraines post-independence history . SBU became involved in the case when Melnychenko accused Leonid Derkach , SBU Chief at the time , of several crimes , e.g. , of clandestine relations with Russian mafia leader Semyon Mogilevich . However , the UDO was subsumed into the SBU after the scandal , so Melnychenko himself has never been an SBU agent .",
      "Later , the SBU played a significant role in the investigation of the Georgiy Gongadze murder case , the crime that caused the Cassette Scandal itself .",
      "In 2004 , General Valeriy Kravchenko , SBUs intelligence representative in Germany , publicly accused his agency of political involvement , including overseas spying on Ukrainian opposition politicians and German TV journalists . He was fired without returning home . After a half-year of hiding in Germany , Kravchenko returned to Ukraine and surrendered in October 2004 ( an investigation is underway ) .",
      "Later , the agency commanders became involved in the scandal around the poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko\u2014a main candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election . Yushchenko felt unwell soon after supper with SBU Chief Ihor Smeshko , at the home of Smeshkos first deputy . However , neither the politician himself nor the investigators have ever directly accused these officers . It is also important to note that the Personal Protection department has been officially responsible for Yushchenkos personal security since he became a candidate . During the Orange Revolution , several SBU veterans and cadets publicly supported him as president-elect , while the agency as a whole remained neutral .",
      "2005\u20132010 .",
      "In 2005 , soon after the elections , sacked SBU Chief Smeshko and other intelligence agents stated their own version of the revolutions events . They claimed to have prevented militsiya from violently suppressing the protests , contradicting the orders of President Kuchma and threatening militsiya with armed involvement of SBUs special forces units . This story was first described by the American journalist C.J . Chivers of The New York Times and has never been supported with documents or legally .",
      "The SBU is widely suspected of illegal surveillance and eavesdropping of offices and phones .",
      "An episode of human rights abuse by SBU happened during the case of serial killer Anatoly Onoprienko . Yuriy Mozola , an initial suspect in the investigation , died in SBU custody in Lviv as a result of torture . Several agents were convicted in the case . The SBU remains a political controversial subject in Ukrainian politics .",
      "2010\u20132014 .",
      "The former Security Service of Ukraine Head Valeriy Khoroshkovsky was involved in several controversies during his tenure . The rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv Borys Gudziak heavily criticized a visit from the SBU , forcing Khoroshkovskiy to apologize . Later the head of the Kyiv Bureau of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation , Nico Lange , was detained for a short while and released only after several high-ranking officials from the German Chancellery vouched for him . The Security Service described the incident as a misunderstanding .",
      "Khoroshkovskiy , as the Chairman of the SBU , eliminated the main competition of Ukrainian TV-giant Inter , officially owned by his wife Olena Khoroshkovskiy , in the face of TVi and Channel 5 . In July 2010 , Konrad Schuller of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that Khoroshkovskiy had connections with RosUkrEnergo . The most important source of Khoroshkovskiys came from RosUkrEnergo . The Presidents spokesperson , Hanna Herman , in an interview with this newspaper , did not dispute that Dmytro Firtash was one of the sponsors of the Presidential Party of Regions , with the help of which Khoroshkovskiy was appointed to the position of the State Security chairman . Khoroshkovskiy denied any connections to RosUkrEnergo . However it is a fact that Firtash possesses certain privileges in Inter . Schuller also stated that the SBU acts in direct association with RosUkrEnergo , arresting their main opponents ( see RosUkrEnergo ) in order to recover their invested money in the recent presidential campaign . Khoroshkovskiy having declined to give an interview to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , Schuller posted a quote from one of his other interviews :",
      "When Minister of Finance Fedir Yaroshenko resigned on January 18 , 2012 , Khoroshkovsky replaced him in the post on the same day . Khoroshkovsky is also the owner of U.A . Inter Media Group which owns major shares in various Ukrainian TV channels including Inter TV . 238 members of the Verkhovna Rada voted for Khoroshkovsky , however the head of the parliamentary committee for the National Security and Defense Anatoliy Hrytsenko stated that the committee accepted the decision to recommend Verkhovna Rada to deny the candidature of Khoroshkovskiy on the post of the chairman of Security Service of Ukraine .",
      "Khoroshkovskiy said the SBUs main duty was to protect the president rather than the interests of Ukraine . On July 26 , 2010 it arrested an internet blogger , producing a warrant for his arrest the next day . SBU accused the blogger of threatening the President of Ukraine , citing his comment May thunder strike Yanukovych! ; he was released after a short discussion . However , SBU showed a rather passive reaction to the statements of the Russian state official who claimed that Crimea and Sevastopol belong to the Russian Federation . Protest group FEMEN said that after the early 2010 election of President Viktor Yanukovych the SBU attempted to intimidate the FEMEN activists .",
      "On May 22 , 2012 Volodymyr Rokytskyi , Deputy Head of the SBU , was photographed in public wearing a $32,000 luxury wristwatch despite the fact that its price amounts to his yearly official income . The instance happened at a joint Ukrainian-American event dedicated to fighting the drug trade .",
      "The SBU uncovered seven spies and 16 special service agents in 2009 .",
      "A large number of arrests and searches occurred in 2011 .",
      "2014\u2013present .",
      "In February 2014 , numerous documents , hard drives , and flash drives , including data on over 22,000 officers and informants , were stolen or destroyed in a raid on the SBU allegedly ordered by President Viktor Yanukovych .",
      "Late February 2014 opposition MP Hennadiy Moskal released papers that showed the SBU had allegedly infiltrated the late 2013-February 2014 anti-government Euromaidan protest . According to BBC Ukraine analyst Olexiy Solohubenko many tactics discussed in the paper had indeed been performed .",
      "After the overthrow of Yanukovich in the February 2014 Ukrainian revolution the new SBU head Valentyn Nalyvaichenko claimed to have found his new office building empty , saying the agency\u2019s former leadership had all fled to Russia or Crimea . There were no operative files , no weapons . Institutionally , the place was totally destroyed . Nalyvaichenko also claimed that at that time the agency was heavily infiltrated by Russian spies . Indeed , Nalyvaichenko predecessor Oleksandr Yakymenko with about 15 former SBU top officials surfaced in Russia a few days later . Allegedly in the months following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution thousands of Ukrainian spies switched sides and began reporting to Russia during the 2014 Crimean crisis and the pro-Russian unrest in east and south Ukraine . At the end of 2014 235 SBU agents , including the former counterintelligence chief and his cousin , and hundreds of other operatives had been arrested and 25 high treason probes against Yanukovych-era SBU officials had been launched ; also all regional directors had been changed , as well as half of their deputies . In July 2015 Nalyvaichenko claimed \u201cThere\u2019s no longer a total infiltration of Russian agents . The danger is no longer widespread\u201d . The arrested agents were replaced by new recruits from western Ukraine , many of them in their early twenties . To test loyalty , all SBU agents are subjected to recurrent interrogations and lie detector tests .",
      "In June 2015 , the Kyiv Post reported that a deputy chief of the SBU , Vitaly Malikov , had supported events leading to the annexation of Crimea . According to February 2016 official figures of the Ukrainian parliamentary Committee on National Security , after Russias annexation 10% of SBU personnel left Crimea . According to the SBU itself ( in November 2017 ) 13% did so .",
      "On December 21 , 2017 , two Ukrainian civil servants were arrested by the SBU for spying on behalf of Russia , one of them being an SBU employee while the other , Stanislav Yezhov , worked for various cabinet ministers .",
      "In late 2018 , the SBU carries out raids across the country targeting the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ( Moscow Patriarchate ) churches and priests .",
      "On July 8 , 2019 , the SBU announced that they conducted a raid into Donbass to apprehend Vladimir Borysovich Tsemakh , who was head of the air defense in Snizhne and a person of interest when a Buk missile launcher was used to shoot down MH17 . The SBU mentioned that hes a witness to the incident .",
      "On April 14 , 2020 , the SBU announced the arrest of Lt . General Valeriy Shaytanov , who was recruited in 2014 by the FSB during a Russian-Ukrainian anti-terrorist working group under the command of Colonel Igor Egorov . He was known to head the anti-terrorist division who had played a prominent role in negotiating ceasefires and prisoner exchanges with Russia-backed militants in Eastern Ukraine . He had planned the future assassination of Adam Osmayev , a Chechen in the International Peacekeeping Battalion named after Dzhokhar Dudayev which is defending Ukraine against Russia aggression .",

As it is mainly West-Franconian historiography that speaks of Arnulfs illegitimacy , it is quite possible that the two females are actually one and the same person and that Carloman married Arnulfs mother , thus legitimizing his son .",
      "Arnulf was granted the rule over the Duchy of Carinthia , a Frankish vassal state and successor of the ancient Principality of Carantania by his father Carloman , after Carloman reconciled with his own father , King Louis the German and was made king in the Duchy of Bavaria .",
      "Arnulf spent his childhood in Mosaburch or Mosapurc , which is widely believed to be Moosburg in Carinthia , a few miles away from one of the Imperial residences , the Carolingian Kaiserpfalz at Karnburg ( Krnski grad ) , which had been the residence of the Carantanian princes . Arnulf kept his seat here and from later events it may be inferred that the Carantanians , from an early time , treated him as their own Duke . Later , after he had been crowned King of East Francia , Arnulf turned his old territory of Carinthia into the March of Carinthia , a part of the Duchy of Bavaria .",
      "Regional ruler .",
      "After King Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke in 879 , Louis the Younger inherited Bavaria , Charles the Fat was given the Kingdom of Italy and Arnulf was confirmed in Carinthia by an agreement with Carloman . However , Bavaria was more or less ruled by Arnulf . Arnulf already ruled Bavaria during the summer and autumn of 879 while his father arranged his succession and he himself was granted Pannonia , in the words of the Annales Fuldenses , or Carantanum , in the words of Regino of Pr\u00fcm . The division of the realm was confirmed in 880 after Carlomans death .",
      "When Engelschalk II of Pannonia in 882 rebelled against Aribo , Margrave of Pannonia and ignited the Wilhelminer War , Arnulf supported him and accepted his and his brothers homage . This ruined Arnulfs relationship with his uncle the Emperor and put him at war with Svatopluk of Moravia . Pannonia was invaded , but Arnulf refused to give up the young Wilhelminers . Arnulf did not make peace with Svatopluk until late 885 , by which time the Moravian ruler was loyal to the emperor . Some scholars see this war as destroying Arnulfs hopes of succeeding Charles the Fat .",
      "King of East Francia .",
      "Arnulf took the leading role in the deposition of his uncle , Emperor Charles the Fat . With the support of the Frankish nobles , Arnulf called a Diet at Tribur and deposed Charles in November 887 , under threat of military action . Charles peacefully agreed to this involuntary retirement , but not without first chastising his nephew for his treachery and asking for a few royal villas in Swabia , which Arnulf granted him , on which to live out his final months . Arnulf , having distinguished himself in the war against the Slavs , was then elected king by the nobles of East Francia ( only the eastern realm , though Charles had ruled the whole of the Frankish Empire ) . West Francia , the Kingdom of Burgundy and the Kingdom of Italy at this point elected their own kings from the Carolingian family .",
      "Like all early Germanic rulers , he was heavily involved in ecclesiastical disputes . In 895 , at the Diet of Tribur , he presided over a dispute between the Episcopal sees of Bremen , Hamburg and Cologne over jurisdictional authority , which saw Bremen and Hamburg remain a combined see , independent of the see of Cologne .",
      "Arnulf was a fighter , not a negotiator . In 890 he was successfully battling Slavs in Pannonia . In early/mid-891 , Vikings invaded Lotharingia , and crushed an East Frankish army at Maastricht . Terms such as Vikings , Danes , Northmen and Norwegians have been used loosely and interchangeably to describe these invaders . At the subsequent Battle of Leuven ( September 891 ) , in Lotharingia , Arnulf repelled the Vikings , and essentially ended their attacks on that front . The Annales Fuldenses report that there were so many dead Northmen that their bodies blocked the run of the river . After this victory Arnulf built a new castle on an island in the Dijle river ( Dutch : Dijle , English and French : Dyle ) .",
      "Intervention in West Francia .",
      "Arnulf took advantage of the problems in West Francia after the death of Charles the Fat to secure the territory of Lotharingia , which he converted into a kingdom for his son Zwentibold . In 889 Arnulf supported the claim of Louis the Blind to the kingdom of Provence , after receiving a personal appeal from Louis mother , Ermengard , who came to see Arnulf at Forchheim in May 889 .",
      "Recognising the superiority of Arnulfs position , in 888 king Odo of France formally accepted the suzerainty of Arnulf . In 893 Arnulf switched his support from Odo to Charles the Simple after being persuaded by Fulk , Archbishop of Reims , that it was in his best interests . Arnulf then took advantage of the following fighting between Odo and Charles in 894 , harrying some territories of West Francia . At one point , Charles the Simple was forced to flee to Arnulf and ask for his protection . His intervention soon forced Pope Formosus to get involved , as he was worried that a divided and war weary West Francia would be easy prey for the Vikings .",
      "In 895 Arnulf summoned both Charles and Odo to his residence at Worms . Charless advisers convinced him not to go , and he sent a representative in his place . Odo , on the other hand , personally attended , together with a large retinue , bearing many gifts for Arnulf . Angered by the non-appearance of Charles , he welcomed Odo at the Diet of Worms in May 895 , and again supported Odos claim to the throne of West Francia . In the same assembly he crowned his illegitimate son Zwentibold as the king of Lotharingia .",
      "Wars with Moravia .",
      "As early as 880 Arnulf had designs on Great Moravia , and had the Frankish bishop Wiching of Nitra interfere with the missionary activities of the Eastern Orthodox priest Methodius , with the aim of preventing any potential for creating a unified Moravian state . Arnulf had formal relations with the ruler of the Moravian Kingdom , Svatopluk , using them to learn the latters military and political secrets . Later , these tactics were used to occupy the territory of the Greater Moravian state .",
      "Arnulf failed to conquer the whole of Great Moravia in wars of 892 , 893 , and 899 . Yet Arnulf did achieve some successes , in particular in 895 , when the Duchy of Bohemia broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal state . An accord was reached between him and Duke of Bohemia Borivoj I ( reigned 870\u201395 ) . Bohemia was thus freed from the dangers of Frankish invasion . In 893 or 894 Great Moravia probably lost a part of its territory \u2014 present-day Western Hungary \u2014 to him . As a reward , Wiching became Arnulfs chancellor in 892 . In his attempts to conquer Moravia , in 899 Arnulf reached out to Magyars who had settled in Pannonia , and with their help he imposed a measure of control over Moravia .",
      "King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor .",
      "In Italy Guy III of Spoleto and Berengar of Friuli fought over the Iron Crown of Lombardy . Berengar had been crowned king in 887 , but Guy was then crowned in 889 . While Pope Stephen V supported Guy , even crowning him Roman Emperor in 891 , Arnulf threw his support behind Berengar .",
      "In 893 the new Pope Formosus , not trusting the newly crowned co-emperors Guy III of Spoleto and his son Lambert II of Spoleto , sent an embassy to Omuntesberch , where Arnulf was meeting with Svatopluk I of Moravia , to request that Arnulf come and liberate Italy , where he would be crowned emperor in Rome . Arnulf met the Primores of the Kingdom of Italy , dismissed them with gifts and promised to assist the pope . Arnulf then sent his son Zwentibold with a Bavarian army to join Berengar of Friuli . They defeated Guy , but were bought off and left in autumn .",
      "When Pope Formosus again asked Arnulf to invade , the duke personally led an army across the Alps early in 894 . In January 894 Bergamo fell , and Count Ambrose , Guys representative in the city , was hung from a tree by the citys gates . Conquering all of the territory north of the Po River , Arnulf forced the surrender of Milan and then drove Guy out of Pavia , where he was crowned King of Italy . Arnulf went no further before Guy died suddenly in late autumn , and a fever incapacitated his troops . His march northward through the Alps was interrupted by Rudolph I of Burgundy , and it was only with great difficulty that Arnulf crossed the mountain range . In retaliation , Arnulf ordered his illegitimate son Zwentibold to ravage Rudolphs kingdom . In the meantime , Lambert and his mother Ageltrude travelled to Rome to receive papal confirmation of his imperial succession , but when Pope Formosus , still desiring to crown Arnulf , refused , he was imprisoned in Castel SantAngelo .",
      "In September 895 a new papal embassy arrived in Regensburg beseeching Arnulfs aid . In October Arnulf undertook his second campaign into Italy . He crossed the Alps quickly and again , took Pavia , but then he continued slowly , garnering support among the nobility of Tuscany . First Maginulf , Count of Milan , and then Walfred of Friuli , joined him . Eventually even Adalbert II of Tuscany abandoned Lambert . Finding Rome locked against him and held by Ageltrude , Arnulf had to take the city by force on February 21 , 896 , freeing the pope . Arnulf was then greeted at the Ponte Milvio by the Roman Senate who escorted him into the Leonine City , where he was received by Pope Formosus on the steps of the Santi Apostoli .",
      "On February 22 , 896 Formosus led the king into the church of St . Peter , anointed and crowned him as emperor , and saluted him as Augustus . Arnulf then proceeded to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls , where he received the homage of the Roman people , who swore never to hand over the city to Lambert or his mother Ageltrude . Arnulf then proceeded to exile to Bavaria two leading senators , Constantine and Stephen , who had helped Ageltrude to seize Rome .",
      "Leaving one of his vassals , Farold , to hold Rome , two weeks later Arnulf marched on Spoleto , where Ageltrude had fled to join Lambert , but now Arnulf suffered a stroke , forcing him to call off the campaign and return to Bavaria . Rumours of the time made Arnulfs condition to be a result of poisoning at the hand of Ageltrude .",
      "Arnulf retained power in Italy only as long as he was personally there . On his way north , he stopped at Pavia where he crowned his illegitimate son Ratold , as sub-King of Italy , after which he left Ratold in Milan in an attempt to preserve his hold on Italy . That same year Pope Formosus died , leaving Lambert once again in power , and both he and Berengar proceeded to kill any officials who had been appointed by Arnulf , forcing Ratold to flee from Milan to Bavaria . For the rest of his life Arnulf exercised very little control in Italy , and his agents in Rome did not prevent the accession of Pope Stephen VI in 896 . The Pope initially gave his support to Arnulf , but eventually became a supporter of Lambert .",
      "Final years .",
      "After 896 Arnulfs health \u2013 besides suffering a stroke he had morbus pediculosis , viz. , infestation of pubic lice of the eyelid \u2013 prevented him from effectively dealing with the problems besetting his reign . Italy was lost , raiders from Moravia and Magyars were continually harassing his lands , and Lotharingia was in revolt against Zwentibold . He was also plagued by escalating violence and power struggles among the lower Frankish nobility .",
      "On December 8 , 899 , Arnulf died at Ratisbon in present-day Bavaria . He is entombed in St . Emmerams Basilica at Regensburg , which is now known as Schloss Thurn und Taxis , the palace of the Princes of Thurn und Taxis .",
      "He was succeeded as the king of East Francia by his only legitimate son from Ota ( died 903 ) , Louis the Child . After Louis death in 911 at age 17 or 18 , the east Frankish branch of the Carolingian dynasty ceased to exist . Arnulf had had the nobility recognize the rights of his illegitimate sons , Zwentibold and Ratold , as his successors . Zwentibold , whom he had made King of Lotharingia in 895 , continued to rule there until his murder in 900 ."

      "On 6 June 2017 , Pioli was named new head coach of Fiorentina . He signed for two years with another optional year . Pioli was in charge of the team when on 4 March 2018 central defender and captain Davide Astori died unexpectedly ; to honor the memory of the player , Pioli got a commemorative tattoo . On 9 April 2019 , Pioli resigned as manager .",
      "Milan .",
      "On 9 October 2019 , Pioli was appointed as the new coach of Milan , on a deal to the end of the season . On 21 July 2020 , Pioli reached an agreement with Milan for a two-year deal extension of his contract as head coach that will now expire in June 2022 . On 23 May 2021 , he secured a return to the Champions League for Milan for the first time in seven seasons .",
      "Style of management .",
      "Pioli usually uses a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation , or a 3\u20135\u20132 formation , with full-backs or wing-backs who actively take part in the teams attacking plays . During his time at Lazio , he often used a 4\u20133\u20133 formation . Due to his passion for basketball , he attempted to bring strategic elements of the sport into his own tactical approach as a football manager .",
      "As a head coach of A.C . Milan , Pioli made use of an archaic WM formation , also known as 3\u20132\u20132\u20133 . Although presented officially as a 4\u20133\u20133 , the formation featured the left full-back , Theo Hernandez , in a more advanced position , whereas the right full-back , Davide Calabria\u2019s , attacking presence was significantly limited . Another key feature of this formation was in the center , where two pairs of holding and attacking midfielders formed a square , supporting each other offensively and defensively .",
      "However , with the arrival of Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 in January 2020 , Pioli switched Milans formation to his long favored 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 , primarily in order to accommodate for the Swedish ageing yet prolific goalscorer , in which he would play up front without much of a defensive work other than pressing , alternating between the roles of a classical striker , a target forward , and a false 9 . The switch of formation also allowed Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu , an attacking midfielder in a number 10 role , to return to his preferred position as a playmaker behind the main striker , out of which he had been playing for years in various other formations . Ante Rebi\u0107 and Isma\u00ebl Bennacer , the two high-profile new arrivals struggling to fit into the previous coachs system , were given a few more opportunities to prove themselves ; as a result , the former got to play in his favorite position as a left winger and quickly topped the clubs seasonal goalscoring chart , while the latter formed an efficient double pivot with Franck Kessi\u00e9 , who also significantly improved the quality of his performances .",
      "Personal life .",
      "On 14 November 2020 , Pioli , alongside his assistant Giacomo Murelli , tested positive for COVID-19 amid its pandemic in Italy . While in quarantine , Pioli continued to be in charge of the team via Zoom and with the help of another member of his coaching staff , Daniele Bonera . Despite these setbacks , Milan had a 3\u20131 away victory over Napoli in Serie A and a 1\u20131 away draw with Lille in Europa League .",

      "Escadron de Chasse 1/2 Cigognes ( Fighter Squadron 1/2 Cigognes ) is a French Air and Space Force ( Arm\u00e9e de lair et de lespace ) fighter squadron currently stationed at BA 116 Luxeuil - Saint-Sauveur Air Base , Haute-Sa\u00f4ne , France .",
      "It inherits the traditions of three notable World War I units : SPA 3 of the famous ace Georges Guynemer , SPA26 , SPA 103 of Ren\u00e9 Fonck , and SPA 12 .",
      "Heir to Escadrille 3 ( the Cigognes Escadrille ) EC 1/2 Cigogne was created on November 1945 , by reorganizing No . 329 Squadron RAF , which the latter was constituted by pilots of Groupe de Chasse 1/2 Cigognes after the armistice of 1940 . The latter was deployed to French Indochina , and combat engaged on Supermarine Spitfire , with Escadrille SPA 3 stationed in Saigon and the SPA 103 stationed in Hanoi . Upon its return to mainland France , the squadron converted to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt in 1948 .",
      "History .",
      "Before and during World War I .",
      "Following a decision taken by the French Army General Council , in June 1912 , the first flights of the French air arm were formed . One of these was established at the army camp of Avord , in Cher . Its designation , B.L . 3 , arose from the aircraft type with which it was equipped , the Bl\u00e9riot XI . Once established , the flight moved eastward , towards Alsace . The sight of this migration led to comparison with the storks which are harbingers spring in Alsace . So the name Cigogne came to be associated in peoples minds with B.L . 3 . Alsace had been part of France until 1871 but in 1912 was part of Germany . The association therefore touched French pride .",
      "It was not until 1916 , under the pressure of the Great War in which aircraft numbers grew rapidly , that the association between the emblem and the unit became official . So that aircrews should be able to recognise other members of their own flight , in order to regroup after dispersal during fighting , the command of the Somme Combat Group , of which flight.3 was then a part , ordered that clear symbols be painted on aircraft . By this time , the flights had been grouped into squadrons . The squadrons commanding officer , Commandant Felix Brocard , chose to make reference to the Alsatian storks by using a white stork with lowered wings as the emblem on the Nieuports of no . 3 flight . He then ordered the other flights of the squadron to choose emblems using storks in other postures . The modern emblem of the squadron bears three storks at three points in the wing-beat cycle . They represent respectively Flight 3 ( wings low ) , Flight 103 ( wings high ) and Flight 12 ( wings spread ) .",
      "See also Escadrille 3 , Escadrille 26 , Escadrille 103 , Escadrille 12",
      "World War II .",
      "Having distinguished itself during the Battle of France in 1940 , the squadron was disbanded in August . However , it was re-formed in July 1941 and equipped with Dewoitine D.520s . In 1942 , it was sent to North Africa where it took its opportunity , with other units , to join the Free French Forces and was shipped to Ayr , in Scotland . There it was given the British designation No . 329 Squadron RAF . On 6 June 1944 , it took part in the Normandy landings and from 19 August , was again based in France , at Sommervieu , Normandy , under Captain Ozanne . At this period , it specialized in ground attack but aerial combat was still part of the job and in December 1944 , the squadron was faced with its first Jet-propelled opposition . In July 1945 , fifteen aircraft of the squadron took part in the victory fly-past .",
      "Post World War II .",
      "In November 1945 , the squadron , EC 1/2 Cigognes was re-established as a unit of the French Air Force . In June 1946 it left for French Indochina where it flew the Supermarine Spitfire , with the SPA 3 flight stationed at Saigon and SPA 103 at Hanoi . On its return to Metropolitan France in 1948 , it was reequipped with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts .",
      "In 1949 , EC 1/2 Cigognes moved to its present base at Dijon-Longvic , at the same time reequipping with De Havilland Vampire jets , followed by the Dassault MD 450 Ouragan , then Dassault Myst\u00e8re IVAs . It was in this aircraft that the squadron was engaged during the Suez Crisis in 1956 . Notably , it became the first unit of the French Air Force to deploy an indigenous Mach-2 fighter , the new Mirage IIIC , on 7 July 1961 . In 1968 these were replaced by Mirage IIIE .",
      "In 1984 , the Storks moved onto the Dassault Mirage 2000C . On September 9 , 1994 , it received a third flight : the SPA 12 . At the end of the 1990s , the squadron moved to Dassault Mirage 2000-5F .",
      "Escadrille SPA 12 was dissolved on September 3 , 2009 and replaced by SPA 26 ( a traditional escadrille of Escadron de Chasse 1/5 Vend\u00e9e , dissolved in 2007 ) .",
      "On Friday 29 July 2011 , the squadron moved to Luxeuil - Saint-Sauveur Air Base . This put an end to the presence of the Cigognes on Aerial Base 102 Dijon-Longvic .",
      "The squadron has played a role in NATOs response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine , providing a pair of Mirage 2000-5F ( along with a pair of Mirage 2000C fighters from EC 2/5 ) which arrived at Polands 22nd Air Base on 2 June 2014 .",

      "Washington Christian Academy ( WCA ) is a private Christian school , established in 1960 , in Silver Spring , Maryland , and located in Olney , Maryland , at a new campus that was completed in 2008 .",
      "History .",
      "Formation .",
      "Washington Christian Academy was formed when local families from Presbyterian and Christian Reformed churches in the area felt the need for a strong , biblically based and diverse school in the Washington metropolitan area . For the time , the school defied cultural values and created a school that specifically named diversity as one of its top qualities . The school was formed as Washington Christian School in 1960 for grades K-4 . WCS grew gradually , and in 1982 it leased a larger building from the county on Franwall Avenue in Silver Spring , which allowed it to add a middle school and offer instruction through the eighth grade . WCS expanded again in 1996 when it merged with the nearby Silver Spring Christian Academy ( a local high school formed by parents of WCS alumni ) , forming Washington Christian Academy ( Pre K-12 ) .",
      "Transition .",
      "During the 2004-2005 school year , Washington Christian Academy was notified that it would need to leave the rented facility the following year as the building was to be torn down to construct a new public school . For the three years from the fall of 2005 through the spring of 2008 , Washington Christian Academy rented space for its elementary school in Colesville Baptist Church off of New Hampshire Avenue in Silver Spring , and likewise rented space for the middle and high schools in Global Mission Church on Georgia Avenue in nearby Aspen Hill . During this transition period , Washington Christian Academy was able to purchase land and build a new facility , which opened in the summer of 2008 .",
      "New Campus .",
      "Washington Christian Academy opened its newly constructed facility in Olney for the fall semester of 2008 . The new building provided the school with an increase in available space and opportunity for future expansion . The new WCA property is in size , with about of land currently developed , including the new building , gym , baseball and soccer fields and parking areas .",
      "Athletics .",
      "With the opening of its new Olney campus , WCA also gained a number of modern athletic facilities : including a gymnasium with a hardwood basketball court and seating for up to 300 , a multi-purpose athletic field employed for soccer and numerous other sports and a baseball field .",
      "WCA offers the following sports : boys soccer , girls soccer , girls volleyball , boys basketball , girls basketball , cheerleading , baseball , softball , coed track team , coed cross country team and coed golf . WCA has competed in the Maryland Independent Schools Athletic League ( MISAL ) for many years , but has now accepted provisional membership into the Potomac Valley Athletic Conference ( PVAC ) for the 2012-2013 school year . Many teams have had success in the MISAL and hope to continue that success in the PVAC .",
      "The WCA Mens Varsity soccer in 2010-11 won the championship game .",
      "After a few years of rebuilding , WCAs soccer program was able to get back on its feet . Within 2015-2017 , the Varsity Boys won back-to-back ; the PVAC Division along with the PVAC Championship capped off with two Maryland Christian State Tournament ( MCST ) Championship final appearances which one game was won . In 2017 , they won the Championship Final of the MCST versus Holly Grove Christian School .

      "Panair do Brasil",
      "Panair do Brasil ( or simply Panair ) was an airline of Brazil . Between 1945 and 1965 it was considered to be the largest carrier not only in Brazil but in all of Latin America . It ceased operations in 1965 .",
      "History .",
      "NYRBA do Brasil ( 1929-1930 ) .",
      "Panair do Brasil began operations on October 22 , 1929 , as NYRBA do Brasil S.A. , a Brazilian subsidiary of NYRBA , Inc . ( New York , Rio , and Buenos Aires Line ) , forerunner of Pan American . Both airlines were established by Ralph Ambrose ONeill for the transportation of post and passengers using seaplanes between the United States , Brazil and Argentina , flying over the east coast of the continent .",
      "NYRBA do Brasil came as an American competitive response to a service that had been provided by Germans since 1927 . Starting that year , Condor Syndikat and later its successor Deutsche Luft Hansa explored the Brazilian market by establishing the subsidiary Syndicato Condor , and the Brazilian airline Varig .",
      "Initially , ONeill tried to purchase ETA \u2013 Empresa de Transporte A\u00e9reo , a Brazilian airline which claimed to have exclusive concessions to fly within Brazil . The legality of the sale and purchase contract was questioned and the operation was aborted . ONeill decided then to create his own Brazilian subsidiary , which would operate in partnership with NYRBA .",
      "At that time , if a foreign airline wanted to operate in Brazilian territory , it was required to create a subsidiary . This allowed a fair competition between national and foreign carriers . Advised by politicians , ONeill established NYRBA do Brasil . The creation of this subsidiary was authorized on October 15 , 1929 and on January 24 , 1930 its operations were authorized in all Brazilian territory , with extensions to Uruguay , Argentina , and the Guianas , pending on bi-lateral agreements . The first flight took off from the Calabou\u00e7o Airport ( which in 1936 would be officially named Santos Dumont Airport ) in Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires with intermediate stops on December 23 , 1929 , and in January 1930 it started flying between Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza with intermediate stops in Campos dos Goytacazes , Vit\u00f3ria , Caravelas , Ilh\u00e9us , Salvador , Aracaju , Macei\u00f3 , Recife and Natal . The first successful cargo operation between Buenos Aires and Miami , a joint-venture with NYRBA , took place between February 19 and 25 , 1930 . In this operation , 8 different seaplanes were used .",
      "On April 30 , 1930 NYRBA was sold to Pan American and , as a consequence , on November 21 , 1930 the new owner of the subsidiary renamed NYRBA do Brasil as Panair do Brasil .",
      "Domestic and Regional Expansion ( 1930-1945 ) .",
      "Regular passenger services began on March 2 , 1931 with a flight between Bel\u00e9m and Rio de Janeiro , a journey that took 5 days . This service was later extended to Buenos Aires and the operations enhanced to the point that it took the same 5 days , with overnight stops in Fortaleza , Salvador , Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre .",
      "Starting in 1933 , Panair do Brasil , competing with Syndicato Condor established services to the interior of Brazil . Panair specialized itself in water-landing operations in the Amazon basin , whereas Condor invested in land operations using the route of Mato Grosso .",
      "In 1937 Panair opened its own dedicated headquarters at Santos Dumont Airport in Rio de Janeiro , a project inspired by the Pan American Seaplane Base and Terminal Building , in Miami , including not only passenger operations but also offices and hangars . It remained its headquarters until it was forced to cease its operations in 1965 . Presently it houses the Third Regional Air Command of the Brazilian Air Force .",
      "In October 1937 Panair received its first land planes , a Lockheed Model 10 Electra and started operations not restricted by water-landing . It was used on services to Belo Horizonte , locations in the state of Minas Gerais reaching later Goi\u00e2nia and to S\u00e3o Paulo . New domestic services were continually opened to the point that in the 1940s , the airline had one of the most extensive domestic networks in the world , covering most of Brazil via the coast and inland , and the Amazon region .",
      "As World War II erupted , Panair gained a clear advantage in relation to its fiercest competitor , Syndicato Condor , controlled by German capital . Furthermore , since the newly created Ministry of Air Force did not have the capacity or technique to build and maintain air fields , by the Federal Decree-Law 3.462 of June 25 , 1941 , Panair was authorized to build , enhance and maintain the airports of Macap\u00e1 , Bel\u00e9m , S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds , Fortaleza , Natal , Recife , Macei\u00f3 , and Salvador , which remain operational to the present day . They had crucial strategic importance in the defense of the South Atlantic and in the transportation logistics between Brazil and West Africa . The authorization lasted for 20 years .",
      "NYRBA do Brasil/Panair do Brasil remained under full control of NYRBA/Pan American until 1942 , when the latter sold a big portion of shares to Brazilian capital . On December 7 , 1943 the participation of Pan American was further reduced to 58% . That same year Panair was authorized to fly to all South American countries .",
      "Panair also innovated by starting on September 2 , 1943 the first overnight service in Brazil : Rio/Bel\u00e9m with intermediate stops .",
      "Intercontinental Expansion ( 1945-1965 ) .",
      "Shortly after the end of World War II , Panair seized the opportunity to grow further . In 1946 , the majority of its shares - 52% - was in the hands of Brazilian nationals and thus satisfied one of the preconditions to operate abroad . The last lot of shares in the hands of Pan Am was sold in 1961 . As such the Brazilian government granted to Panair the concession to operate services to Europe , being the only Brazilian airline with such a concession .",
      "In March 1946 Panair received its first Lockheed 049 Constellation , being the first airline outside the United States to operate this aircraft . The first flight took off on April 27 , 1946 from Rio de Janeiro to Recife , Dakar , Lisbon , Paris and London . Panair was also the first international airline to land on the then newly inaugurated London Heathrow Airport .",
      "As Panair received further equipment , flights to Madrid and Rome were inaugurated . In 1947 services were extended to Cairo and Istanbul , and in 1948 to Zurich and Frankfurt . The same year , services to Montevideo and Buenos Aires began . Santiago de Chile , Lima and Beirut were added in 1950 and Hamburg and D\u00fcsseldorf in 1954 .",
      "The airline gradually set such a high standard for its customer services and for many years in Brazil the expression padr\u00e3o Panair ( ) , became a synonym of excellence in aviation . In fact , the excellence was so well known at the time that years later its DC-8-33 appeared in a handful of movies , including the Italian-French co-production , ( 1962 ) , and the French productions La Peau Douce ( 1964 ) , and Lhomme de Rio ( 1964 ) .",
      "In 1953 Panair placed an order for 4 de Havilland Comet 2 with an option for further 2 Comet 3 . Panair was the second airline to place an order to such aircraft , only behind BOAC . Those orders were canceled in 1954 due to flaws on the planes original design .",
      "In 1955 the unused funds of the Comet order were used to purchase 4 Douglas DC-7C , at that time the ideal aircraft for long-haul operations . The first arrived in 1957 . In 1961 Panair purchased 4 Sud Aviation Caravelle , which entered into service in 1962 , operating on domestic trunk routes .",
      "In terms of agreements , between 1956 and 1958 Panair and L\u00f3ide A\u00e9reo Nacional maintained an agreement to avoid harmful competition , in which the Brazilian territory was divided into areas of influence . The agreement also included leasing of aircraft . Between November 30 , 1960 and 1965 Panair operated with TAP-Transportes A\u00e9reos Portugueses the Voo da amizade ( ) , between S\u00e3o Paulo-Congonhas , Rio de Janeiro-Gale\u00e3o and Lisbon , with stops in Recife and Sal , using a dedicated Douglas DC-7C aircraft bearing the names of both airlines , TAP flight numbers and crew of the two airlines . Only Brazilian and Portuguese citizens or foreigners with permanent residence in Brazil or Portugal could purchase tickets for those flights , which were extremely popular due to their low fares .",
      "In 1961 , Panair started operating the Douglas DC-8-33 to Europe . However , in spite of its excellent service , Panair faced increasing competition from other foreign state-run airlines . Addressing the situation , Panair formed an operational pool with Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas , Alitalia , and Lufthansa . In 1962 , Panair incorporated SUD SE-210 Caravelle 6-R jet aircraft for its main domestic and South American routes .",
      "Shutdown ( 1965 ) .",
      "Panair do Brasil was forced to cease operations abruptly on February 10 , 1965 , when the Brazilian military government , which seized power the year before , suspended its operational certification and allotted its international route concessions to Varig and domestic to Cruzeiro do Sul . In fact , that very night , the Douglas DC-8-33 scheduled to operate flight PB22 , departing at 10:30 PM from Rio de Janeiro-Gale\u00e3o to Recife , Lisbon , Paris-Orly and Frankfurt was immediately replaced by a Varig Boeing 707 . There were no flight cancellations . The operation also involved the transfer of 3 of its Caravelles and 3 of its Catalinas to Cruzeiro do Sul , and 2 of its DC-8-33 to Varig . It is known today that Varig and Cruzeiro had previous knowledge of the governments decision and time to prepare .",
      "The sudden suspension of Panair shocked the country . Since its financial problems were not serious enough to justify the governments actions , the company tried to protect its assets by filing for bankruptcy protection while its lawyers debated the issue in Court . Pressured by the military , the judge that was studying the carriers plea declared Panair officially bankrupt on February 15 , 1965 .",
      "It has since been determined that the shutdown of Panair do Brasil was not based on financial or technical reasons , but on other political factors , such as the military government persecution of the companys shareholders , businessmen Celso da Rocha Miranda and M\u00e1rio Wallace Simonsen .",
      "Beyond the Forced Bankruptcy ( 1965-ongoing ) .",
      "The controversial decision to liquidate Panair so suddenly triggered a lengthy legal battle . On December 14 , 1984 , the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court acknowledged that the airline had operated within regular technical and financial parameters when it was shut down and the Federal government was sentenced to pay reparations to its former owners and/or heirs . The forced bankruptcy was suspended on May 5 , 1995 , and since then Panair seeks indemnizations from the Ministry of Justice .",
      "On August 27 , 2009 , after a 44-year delay , the Air Command of the Brazilian Ministry of Defence revoked Panairs route and schedule concessions , which are mandatory for airline operations .",
      "Former employees of Panair do Brasil , their families and friends attend an annual reunion on the week of October 22 , the airlines birthday , in Rio de Janeiro . This tradition has been religiously preserved since 1966 and there is a movement to include it in the Guinness World Records .",
      "Panair do Brasil has been featured in a number of Brazilian television productions , such as Anos Rebeldes ( 1992 ) , Hilda Furac\u00e3o ( 1998 ) , JK ( TV series ) ( 2006 ) and ( 2009 ) .",
      "In 2008 the documentary Panair do Brasil was released . The film , directed by Marco Altberg and screenwritten by Daniel Leb Sasaki summarises the history of the airline .",
      "In October 2012 , director Ricardo Pinto e Silva and journalist Daniel Leb Sasaki began production for a new feature documentary film called Mario Wallace Simonsen , entre a mem\u00f3ria e a hist\u00f3ria , still unreleased . The pair interviewed former Panair employees during their 2012 reunion .",
      "On March 23 , 2013 , the Brazilian National Truth Commission , established in 2012 by the Brazilian government to investigate acts of human rights violations between 1946 and 1988 , held a public event in Rio de Janeiro to address the circumstances behind the shutdown of Panair do Brasil . The group has recently had access to unpublished documentation which would prove that the companys owners were victims of the countrys military regime .",
      "On March 11 , 2019 , Brazilian newspaper O Globo informed that Daniel Leb Sasakis book about the demise of Panair do Brasil , called Pouso for\u00e7ado : a hist\u00f3ria por tr\u00e1s da destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da Panair do Brasil pelo regime militar , will become a TV series directed by Mauro Lima and screenwritten by Rosana Rodini and the author himself .",

      "Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna",
      "Count Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna ( 19 July 1750 \u2013 29 July 1818 ) is considered one of the foremost Swedish poets of the Gustavian period . A prominent courtier during the reign of King Gustav III of Sweden , he was also a politician , diplomat and member of the Swedish Academy , holding seat number 8 . On several occasions he was a member of the Swedish Government and Parliament . Amongst other things , Oxenstierna is also known for his translation into Swedish of John Miltons epic blank verse poem Paradise Lost .",
      "Early life .",
      "Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna was born at the Sken\u00e4s estate , by lake Kolsnaren ( now in Ving\u00e5ker Municipality ) , in the province of S\u00f6dermanland . He lived here during his youth with his parents , major general count G\u00f6ran Oxenstierna , a member of the Korsholm och Wasa branch of the Oxenstierna family , and countess Sara Gyllenborg , and with his grandparents , Margareta Gyllenborg ( n\u00e9e von Beijer ) and Jan Gyllenborg . The grandparents took active part in the upbringing of young Johan Gabriel - the grandfather until he died in 1752 - as the parents at times resided at Carlsten , due to the fathers military career . He was the oldest of four brothers .",
      "His childhood at Sken\u00e4s came to play a leading role in his later authorship in many ways . The beauty of the nature of S\u00f6dermanland , and the memories of his upbringing there , came to inspire the themes of his pre-romantic publications . His maternal uncle , poet Gustaf Fredrik Gyllenborg , in whose house he spent a lot of time , and his tutor , poet Olof Bergklint , came to inspire his career choice as a poet , as well as his poetry in itself . A person , whose writings he read and admired during this time , and who came to inspire him , was poet Gustaf Philip Creutz .",
      "In 1762 he was enrolled as a student at Uppsala University , from which he graduated in 1767 with an administrative degree ( kansliexamen ) . Bergklint served as a tutor for his university studies , starting in 1764 . During his studies he lived , at times , in Uppsala .",
      "Although Oxenstiernas writings were not published until after he moved from Sken\u00e4s and started working , he did write a Diary between 1766 and 1768 , which was published in 1965 by Bokgillet publishers in Uppsala under the title Ljuva ungdomstid : Dagbok 1766\u20131768 ( Sweet Time of Youth : Diary 1766\u20131768 ) . In it he makes everyday observations of his life at Sken\u00e4s , and later in Uppsala and Stockholm . The diary , which was written in French , reveals a melancholic and emotional character and a deep interest in nature and poetry , rather than the rational philosophy of that time .",
      "Public career .",
      "Like his father and three brothers , Oxenstierna embarked upon a career in the public sector . After graduating from Uppsala , and after a successful disputation , in front of the royal court , he was employed at the Royal Chancellery , in the department for foreign correspondence . During this time he resided with his uncle , Gustaf Gyllenborg . He was appointed acting Commission Secretary in Vienna in 1770 , and made the regular Commission Secretary in that city in 1772 ; the year of king Gustav IIIs coup detat and the establishment of absolute monarchy in Sweden . He seems to have been rather uninterested in his diplomatic work in Vienna , and more interested in his poetry and in a letter exchange with an Austrian lady , which showed clear Rousseauan influence .",
      "In 1774 he was recalled to Stockholm by the king and made a Chamberlain . He had hoped for a position at the Swedish legation in Paris , but instead received the titular office of second secretary of the Presidential office ( i.e . the Department for foreign affairs ) . As a chamberlain his poetic talents came to use , and brought him closer to the king , who was particularly enthused by his ability to write and speak in French . As a result of the kings trust in him , he was sent on diplomatic missions to several German states in 1778 . He was made a senior Chamberlain in 1783 and a Member of the College of the Chancellery in 1785 , with a special assignment to work with matters relating to Pomerania and Wismar . In 1786 , the king made him a member of the Privy Council of Sweden and President of the College of the Chancellery , together with Emanuel De Geer . As President of the Chancellery Oxenstierna was the head of the Privy Council and responsible for relating matters of foreign policy to the king .",
      "When the Privy Council was dissolved and the office of College of the Chancellery abolished in 1789 , he was made Head Steward for the queen , and in the absence of the king during the Russo-Swedish War ( 1788\u20131790 ) , he was a member of the Cabinet . During this time , believing the king was about to abdicate , he worked to form an alliance with other nobles and Duke Charles to force the king to make peace with Russia and go into a defensive alliance with Denmark and Russia . The king , however , remained on the throne until his assassination in 1792 , shortly before which Oxenstierna was made a Riksmarskalk ( Marshal of the Kingdom ) . After the kings death , he left all public offices , but remained as a Marshal at the court .",
      "After king Gustavs death he temporarily fell from grace with the new rulers . He made a short comeback as a cabinet member in 1798 and 1799 , while king Gustav IV Adolf travelled through Europe . In 1801 he stepped down as Riksmarskalk and was without any political influence until after the revolution of 1809 , which deposed king Gustav IV Adolf and introduced the Constitution of 1809 . Oxenstierna disliked the revolution , but accepted being chairman of a committee during the Parliament of 1809 , and again in 1815 . However , he was not in any way an influential politician .",
      "Oxenstierna was never a formidable politician or diplomat . As mentioned before , he showed a distinct lack of interest already during his first diplomatic mission in Vienna . The king often kept him uninformed and took care of business himself . Gustav III simply liked having an Oxenstierna by his side , because of the familys notability in matters of state since the days of Axel Oxenstierna . Oxenstierna often got distracted from his work , his mind wandering to more interesting matters , to the extent that he sometimes wrote public documents in verse . His contemporaries described him as unsuitable for management and as a Riksmarskalk he managed to misorganize both the funeral of king Gustav III and the coronation of the new king Charles XIII , drawing many complaints , even from the new king himself . He was not blind to this lack of administrative ability , and when he was suggested as President of the Chancellery he wrote to a friend : This is insane and can never be , as I am not competent for this post .",

      "Carles Puigdemont",
      "Carles Puigdemont i Casamaj\u00f3 ( ; born 29 December 1962 ) is a Catalan pro-independence politician and journalist from Spain . Since 2019 he has served as a Member of the European Parliament ( MEP ) . A former Mayor of Girona , Puigdemont served as the 130th President of Catalonia from 2016 to 2017 when he was removed from office by the Spanish Government following the unilateral Catalan declaration of independence . He is co-founder of the National Call for the Republic ( CNxR ) , leader of the Together for Catalonia ( JuntsxCat ) electoral alliance and founder of the Together for Catalonia party .",
      "After education in Amer and Girona , he became a journalist in 1982 , writing for various local publications and becoming editor-in-chief of El Punt . He was director of the Catalan News Agency from 1999 to 2002 and director of Gironas House of Culture from 2002 to 2004 . Puigdemonts family were supporters of Catalan independence and Puigdemont became involved in politics as a teenager , joining the nationalist Democratic Convergence of Catalonia ( CDC ) , the predecessor to the PDeCAT , in 1980 . He gave up journalism to pursue a career in politics in 2006 when he was elected as a member of the Parliament of Catalonia for the constituency of Girona . He was elected to the Municipality Council of Girona in 2007 and in 2011 he became Mayor of Girona . On 10 January 2016 , following an agreement between the Junts pel S\u00ed ( JxS\u00ed ) , an electoral alliance led by the CDC , and the Popular Unity Candidacy ( CUP ) , the Parliament of Catalonia elected Puigdemont as the 130th President of the Government of Catalonia .",
      "On 6\u20137 September 2017 , he approved laws for permitting an independence referendum , and the juridical transition and foundation of a Republic , a new constitution for Catalonia that would be in place if the referendum supported independence . On 1 October 2017 , the Catalan independence referendum was held in Catalonia despite Spains Constitutional Court ruling that it breached the Spanish constitution . Despite the closing of polling stations and the use of excessive force by Spanish Police 43% of Catalan citizens managed to vote in the referendum , 92% of them supporting independence . The Catalan Parliament declared independence on 27 October 2017 which resulted in the Spanish government imposing direct rule on Catalonia , dismissing Puigdemont and the Catalan government . The Catalan Parliament was dissolved and the 2017 Catalan regional election was held . On 30 October 2017 charges of rebellion , sedition and misuse of public funds were brought against Puigdemont and other members of the Puigdemont Government . Puigdemont , along with others , fled to Belgium and European Arrest Warrants ( EAW ) were issued against them . At the regional elections held on 21 December 2017 Puigdemont was re-elected to Parliament and Catalan secessionists retained a slim majority . Official results shown an actual support for independence of 47.6% versus a 43.5% that voted against independence parties , the rest being non-aligned parties and blank votes . Puigdemont called for fresh talks with the then Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy but these were rejected .",
      "Puigdemont remained in Belgium to avoid arrest if he returned to Spain , with this situation being defined as exile by some , self-imposed exile by some others , and also as fugitive from justice . On 25 March 2018 , he was detained by the Autobahnpolizei ( highway patrol ) acting on his European Arrest Warrant in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein . He was released on bail , with the state high court deciding he could not be extradited for rebellion as German law does not coincide with Spanish law on the definition thereof , a requirement of his EAW . On 10 July 2018 a Spanish Supreme Court judge suspended him as a deputy in the Catalan parliament . On 12 July 2018 , a German court decided that he could be extradited back to Spain for misuse of public funds , but not for the more serious charge of rebellion . Puigdemonts legal team said they would appeal any decision to extradite him . Following the German court decision , on 19 July 2018 , Spain dropped the European arrest warrants against Puigdemont and other Catalan officials in self-exile .",
      "Early life and family .",
      "Puigdemont was born on 29 December 1962 in Amer , a village in the comarca of la Selva in the province of Girona in north-eastern Catalonia , Spain . The son of Francesc Xavier Puigdemont i Oliveras , a baker , and Francescs wife N\u00faria Casamaj\u00f3 i Ruiz , he is the second of eight brothers . Puigdemonts maternal grandmother was Andalusian . Puigdemonts grandfather , who fought in the Spanish Civil War before fleeing to France , founded the Pastisseria Puigdemont in 1928 . The Puigdemont family still own the bakery located in Amers main square . Puigdemonts great-grandfather and his uncle Josep Puigdemont were mayors of Amer and were supporters of Catalan independence , as was Puigdemonts father Xavier .",
      "Puigdemont received basic education in Amer before , aged nine , he was sent to study at the Church-run Santa Maria del Collell boarding school in Girona where he was taught in Spanish and learned to be a fighter . At the age of 16 he was already a reporter for the Diari de Girona newspaper , writing articles on football and other news .",
      "As a teenager Puigdemont attended political meetings with his uncle Josep and helped found the Nationalist Youth of Catalonia . In 1980 he joined the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia ( CDC ) , a conservative Catalan nationalist political party , now known as the Catalan European Democratic Party ( PDeCAT ) .",
      "After school Puigdemont joined the University College of Girona to study Catalan philology but dropped out to pursue a career in journalism . In 1983 , aged 21 , Puigdemont was involved in a car accident which left him seriously injured and with a slight scar on his face . It has been suggested that this explains his Beatle haircut but friends deny this .",
      "Journalism career .",
      "Puigdemont joined the El Punt , a pro-independence Catalan language newspaper , as a journalist in 1982 . He rose through the ranks to become the papers editor-in-chief . He also wrote a weekly column for the Pres\u00e8ncia magazine . He is a member of the Catalan Journalists Association .",
      "Beginning in 1988 , Puigdemont started collecting references about Catalonia in the international press , material that resulted in the publication of the 1994 book Cata.. . qu\u00e8 ? Catalunya vista per la premsa internacional ( Cata...what ? Catalonia as seen by the foreign press ) . During the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona Puigdemont was a member of an organisation supporting Catalan nationalists detained as part of Operation Garz\u00f3n .",
      "In the 1990s Puigdemont took a year off work to study linguistic policies elsewhere in Europe . As a result , he started working on application of new technologies in the provision of news and founded the Catalan News Agency ( ACN ) which was established by the Generalitat de Catalunya in 1999 . Puigdemont also founded Catalonia Today , an English-language magazine . Puigdemont was director of ACN until 2002 , when the then-president of the Diputaci\u00f3 de Girona , Carles P\u00e0ramo , offered him the position of director of the Girona cultural centre , the Casa de Cultura , a position he held until 2004 .",
      "Political career .",
      "Puigdemont left journalism to devote himself fully to politics in 2006 when the Convergence and Union ( CiU ) electoral alliance invited him to be a candidate for the Parliament of Catalonia . Puigdemont contested the 2006 regional election as a CiU candidate in the Province of Girona and was elected . He was re-elected at the 2010 , 2012 and 2015 regional elections , the latter as a Junts pel S\u00ed ( JxS\u00ed ) electoral alliance candidate .",
      "Puigdemont contested the 2007 local elections as a CiU candidate in Girona and was elected but the CiU remained in opposition . At the 2011 local elections , in which Puigdemont we re-elected , the CiU ended the Socialistss 32-year rule in Girona . Puigdemont became Mayor of Girona . He was re-elected at the 2015 local elections . He was a member of Executive Committee of the Association of Municipalities for Independence and in July 2015 succeeded Josep Maria Vila dAbadal as its chair .",
      "Following a last-minute agreement between pro-Catalan independence parties Junts pel S\u00ed and Popular Unity Candidacy to replace Artur Mas due in part to the various alleged cases of corruption and the austerity cuts under his government , Puigdemont was elected the 130th President of Catalonia on 10 January 2016 . He resigned as Mayor of Girona on 11 January 2016 as no-one is allowed to be a regional president and a municipal mayor at the same time . He was the first President of Catalonia to refuse to take the oath of loyalty to the Spanish constitution and the Spanish monarch .",
      "Constitutional crisis .",
      "In June 2017 Puigdemont announced that the Catalan independence referendum would be held on 1 October 2017 . The Catalan Parliament passed legislation on 6 September 2017 authorising the referendum which would be binding and based on a simple majority without a minimum threshold . The following day Constitutional Court of Spain suspended the legislation , blocking the referendum . The Spanish government put into effect Operation Anubis in order to disrupt the organisation of the referendum and arrested Catalan government officials . Despite this the referendum went ahead though it was boycotted by opponents of secessionism and turnout was only 43% . Among those who voted 92% supported independence . Around 900 people were injured as the Spanish police used violence to try to prevent voting in the referendum .",
      "On 27 October 2017 the Catalan Parliament declared independence in a vote boycotted by opposition MPs . Almost immediately the Senate of Spain invoked article 155 of the constitution , dismissing Puigdemont and the Catalan government and imposing direct rule on Catalonia . The following day Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan Parliament and called for fresh regional elections on 21 December 2017 . On 30 October 2017 Spanish Attorney General Jos\u00e9 Manuel Maza laid charges of rebellion , sedition and misuse of public funds at the Audiencia Nacional against Puigdemont and other members of the Catalan government . The charges carry maximum sentences of 30 , 15 and 6 years in prison respectively .",
      "Puigdemont and five other Catalan ministers ( Dolors Bassa , Meritxell Borr\u00e1s , Antoni Com\u00edn , Joaquim Forn and Meritxell Serret ) arrived in Belgium on 30 October 2017 . According to Spanish media the group had driven to Marseille shortly after the charges were laid before the Audiencia Nacional and from there flown to Brussels . Puigdemont claimed that he had gone to the capital of Europe to speak from a position of freedom and safety and that he would not return to Spain unless he was guaranteed a fair trial . Earlier Belgiums Secretary of State for Asylum , Migration and Administrative Simplification Theo Francken had stated that prospect of Puigdemont being granted asylum was not unrealistic .",
      "Exile .",
      "On 3 November 2017 a Spanish judge issued European Arrest Warrants against Com\u00edn , Clara Ponsat\u00ed i Obiols , Llu\u00eds Puig , Puigdemont and Serret after they failed to attend a high court hearing in Madrid the previous day . On 5 November 2017 the five politicians , accompanied by their lawyers , surrendered to the Belgian police but after a ten-hour hearing a Belgian judge released them all on bail . They were ordered not to leave Belgium without permission and had to provide details of their accommodation . On 5 December 2017 the Supreme Court of Spain withdrew the European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) against Puigdemont and four others stating that EAW were not valid for alleged crimes committed by a wider group of people , e.g . the Catalan government . But judge warned that the national arrest warrants remain valid , meaning that the group risked arrest if they returned to Spain .",
      "While remaining self-exiled , Puigdemont contested the 2017 regional election as a Together for Catalonia ( JuntsxCat ) electoral alliance candidate in the Province of Barcelona and was re-elected to Parliament . At the election Catalan secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan Parliament . After the election Puigdemont called for new unconditional talks with the Spanish government and that he was willing to meet Rajoy outside of Spain . Rajoy rejected the offer , saying that he was only willing to speak with the leader of the Catalan government , whom he considered to be In\u00e9s Arrimadas , leader of the unionist Citizens , the largest single party in the Catalan Parliament .",
      "On 1 March 2018 , Puigdemont was hoping to be selected by the Catalan Parliament as President of Catalonia again , but the Catalan Parliament heeded warnings from Spains judiciary and postponed the session in which Puigdemont could be selected . Subsequently , Puigdemont announced that he was no longer seeking re-election as leader of Catalonia . Later he announced the creation of a government-in-exile organization named Council of the Republic .",
      "On 25 March 2018 , while returning to Brussels from a trip to Finland , Puigdemont was stopped in Germany near the Danish border and arrested pursuant to the European warrant that had been reissued against him two days previously . On 5 April 2018 , the Oberlandesgericht ( Higher State Court ) in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein ruled that Puigdemont would not be extradited on charges of rebellion , and released him on bail while deliberating about the extradition on charges of misuse of public funds . According to that decision , Puigdemont was required to report to police once a week and could not leave Germany without permission of the public prosecutor .",
      "After his release , Puigdemont called on Spains government to release Catalan separatists from imprisonment and establish a dialog with them .",
      "On 12 July 2018 the higher court in Schleswig-Holstein confirmed that Puigdemont could not be extradited by the crime of rebellion , but may still be extradited based on charges of misuse of public funds . Puigdemonts legal team said they would appeal any decision to extradite him . Ultimately , though , Spain dropped its European arrest warrant , ending the extradition attempt . Puigdemont was once again free to travel , and chose to return to Belgium .",
      "In January 2019 Puigdemont filed a constitutional application for amparo directed against the president of the Catalan parliament , Roger Torrent and the Board of the Chamber . The complaint , presented to the Spanish Constitutional Court , argued Puigdemont had been denied the use of his political rights as Torrent did not allow him to delegate his vote from Belgium after Puigdemonts criminal indictment and suspension of his parliamentary condition by Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena .",
      "Following the April 2019 arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London , Puigdemont said that Human rights , and especially freedom of expression , are under attack once again in Europe .",
      "Puigdemont ran 1st in the list for the 2019 European Parliament election in Spain and he was elected member of the European Parliament . However , he refused to attend the act of observance of the Spanish Constitution before the Junta Electoral Central in Madrid , a requirement to acquire a certificate as a Member of the European Parliament ( MEP ) . The consequential absence of Puigdemont and Toni Com\u00edn in the list of certificated Spanish MEPs was communicated to them by the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani through a letter ; the letter also explained that , therefore , he could not address them as MEPs . Puigdemont and Com\u00edn filed a request before the General Court of the European Union asking for precautionary measures against the decision of the European Parliament , which was dismissed . He spent much of the inaugural session of the European Parliament on 2 July 2019 in the German city of Kehl , across the Rhine from the seat of the European Parliament in the city of Strasbourg , located on French soil and avoided by Puigdemont . Judge Pablo Llarena has reactivated a detention order of Puigdemont both in Europe and also reactivated an international detention order of Puigdemont in October 2019 .",
      "On 20 December 2019 , Puigdemont was accredited as an MEP after a ruling from the European Court of Justice said that he was permitted to take on his role as MEP .",
      "Puigdemont and Com\u00edn attended their first EP session on 13 January 2020 as non-attached members . Puigdemont first intervention dealt with a defense of the right of self-determination . Both MEPs asked to join the Greens\u2013European Free Alliance ( EU parliament party political group ) co-president Philippe Lamberts acknowledged the group considered the request a problem for them and , while entertaining internal debate in order to decide on the issue , Lamberts deemed the most logical outcome would be for them to join the group to which their best Belgian friends ( the N-VA ) belong . Also in January 2020 , Spanish Supreme Court judge Manuel Marchena proceeded to file an application before EP President David Sassoli in order to revoke the immunity of Puigdemont and Com\u00edn .",
      "Later in January 2020 , just hours before the scheduled internal vote among the Greens/ALE MEPs on the request filed by Puigdemont and Com\u00edn to join the Greens/ALE group , both Puigdemont and Com\u00edn withdrew their application .",
      "On 30 April 2021 , Morocco granted Puigdemont asylum . According to a source from the Moroccan foreign ministry , the decision was made in due to the principle of reciprocity to host the Catalan independence leader after Sahrawi President Brahim Ghali was allowed to go to Spain to get treated for COVID-19 .",
      "Ideology and positions .",
      "One of the founders of the youth organization of the right-of-centre Democratic Convergence of Catalonia ( CDC ) in the province of Girona , Puigdemont has associated himself since then with the most staunchly pro-independence faction in the party . His tenure as Mayor in Girona was characterised by liberal economic policies . In 2017 , he considered the European Union to be a club of decadent and obsolescent countries that was controlled by a small few , also suggesting that Catalonia should be allowed to vote on its exit from the EU if Catalans wanted it . Although he openly supports the EU and Euro , he has supported the idea that we should work to change it . He has rejected a EU which does not protect human rights and the right of representation . He has denied being europhobic and he has referred to himself and his party not as eurosceptic but as euro-demanding .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Puigdemont married Romanian journalist Marcela Topor in 2000 . They have two daughters , Magali and Maria , and live in Girona . He speaks Catalan , English , French , Romanian and Spanish . Puigdemont is a supporter of Girona FC and FC Barcelona and plays rock guitar and the electric piano . As a youngster Puigdemont played bass in a short-lived Catalan rock band formed about 1980 .",
      "On 2 February 2018 , the Belgian commune of Waterloo confirmed that he had rented a villa and planned to establish his official residence there .",

      "EMD SDP40F",
      "The EMD SDP40F was a six-axle C-C diesel\u2013electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division ( EMD ) from 1973\u20131974 . EMD built 150 for Amtrak , the operator of most intercity passenger trains in the United States . Amtrak , a private company but funded by the United States government , had begun operation in 1971 with a fleet of aging diesel locomotives inherited from various private railroads . The SDP40F was the first diesel locomotive built new for Amtrak and for a brief time they formed the backbone of the companys long-distance fleet .",
      "A series of derailments in the mid-1970s shattered Amtraks confidence in the locomotive , and many railroads banned it from their tracks . Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotives trucks , the weight of the water and steam generators used for train heating , or the harmonic vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive . In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH , which was already in use on short-distance routes . Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD ; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs . The remainder were traded to the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ( ATSF ) for use in freight service . The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2 . The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway ( BNSF ) , successor to the Santa Fe , retired them in 2002 . One of them is preserved , that one being ex-Amtrak No . 644 .",
      "Background .",
      "Amtrak assumed operation of most intercity rail passenger service in the United States on May 1 , 1971 . Until then such services were operated by various private railroads . The private railroads chose to retain their second generation passenger locomotives for freight service , or to operate the various commuter services which , by law , did not pass to Amtrak . To operate these intercity services the Amtrak had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained . This left Amtrak with an aging and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives . The mainstays of Amtraks road diesel fleet were veteran E units and F units , the newest of which were 10\u201320 years old and due for replacement .",
      "Design .",
      "The SDP40F was a full-width cowl unit . It was based on the EMD FP45 passenger locomotive and EMD SD40-2 freight locomotive . All three shared the EMD 645E3 diesel prime mover , which developed . The locomotive had a gear ratio of 57:20 . Maximum speed at full horsepower was ; the locomotive exceeded in tests . The SDP40F was fitted with a Leslie Controls SL4T ( S4T ) . There were doubts at the time about Amtraks long-term viability , so the locomotives were designed for easy conversion to freight locomotives should Amtrak cease operation .",
      "In the early 1970s Amtraks passenger car fleet was steam-heated ; Amtraks requirement called for two steam generators . These were located at the rear of the locomotive . Forward of the generators was a water tank . This tank rested above the floorline . The lateral motion of the water within was later implicated in several derailments . The primary underbody tank was split between water and diesel fuel , carrying of water and of diesel . Provision was made for eventual conversion to head-end power ( HEP ) , but it was never carried out .",
      "EMD based the SDP40F name on the existing SDP40 . Several years earlier , EMD had made similar versions of the SDP45 and SD45 in a full-width cowl unit , which it named FP45 and F45 . Although the SDP40F was externally nearly identical to the FP45 , EMD chose not to give the new locomotive a similar name such as FP40 . EMD wanted to avoid adding a new locomotive type to their catalog due to price controls in effect in the early 1970s . The following year , the F40C name was used for a similar locomotive ordered by the Chicago , Milwaukee , St . Paul and Pacific Railroad ( the Milwaukee Road ) , equipped with HEP instead of steam generators .",
      "There were several minor differences between the first 40 locomotives built and later examples . The most important was the installation of lower-profile cooling fans and air horns to avoid clearance problems in the Eastern US .",
      "History .",
      "Amtrak ordered 150 SDP40Fs , in two batches . The first order , placed on November 2 , 1972 , was for 40 locomotives , at a cost of $18 million . A second order , for 110 locomotives at $50 million , followed on October 12 , 1973 . These orders were Amtraks first for new-build locomotives . Amtrak deployed the original 40 locomotives on long-distance trains in the Western United States . The locomotives entered revenue service on June 22 , 1973 , hauling the Super Chief from Chicago to Los Angeles over the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway . SDP40Fs were also used on the Burlington Northern Railroad . The arrival of the second order enabled Amtrak to deploy the SDP40Fs throughout the country , displacing the inherited E-units .",
      "Derailments .",
      "In late 1975 J . David Ingles called the SDP40Fs the stars of Amtraks long-distance trains , but engine crews reported that the locomotives rode poorly compared to the E-units they had replaced . Even as Amtrak and EMD investigated the ride quality , the SDP40F was involved in a series of derailments that would lead to an end to its career as a passenger locomotive . Between 1974\u20131976 the Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA ) identified thirteen incidents for which the locomotive was responsible . None of the incidents were serious , but their frequency was a concern . Most of the derailments occurred on trains with two SDP40Fs on the front and at least one trailing baggage car . While the rear truck of the second locomotive and the front truck of the baggage car were pinpointed as the source of the derailment , the actual cause of the derailments was unclear .",
      "EMD , Amtrak , the Association of American Railroads ( AAR ) , and the FRA tested the locomotive thoroughly , with suspicion falling on the hollow bolster truck design . In the end , the investigators theorized that the steam generators and water tank may have made the rear of the engine too heavy and created too much lateral motion . Later FRA investigations concluded that the actual culprit was the light weight of the baggage cars , which caused harmonic vibrations when placed directly behind the much heavier SDP40F . A contributing factor was the sometimes poor quality of track the locomotive operated over .",
      "Amtrak took several corrective measures , including operating with a reduced speed on curves , emptying the smaller of the two water tanks to reduce lateral motion , and making various alterations to the trucks . The measures helped , but the trouble continued . Several railroads , including the Burlington and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ( C&O ) , banned the rail breakers from their tracks ; they were suspected to be causing the spreading of rails because of their lateral swaying , which may have contributed to the derailments . For the Chicago\u2013Seattle Empire Builder , the speed restrictions added 6 hours to what had been a 46-hour schedule . Another important development was the unusually harsh winter of 1976\u20131977 , which sidelined many of Amtraks aging steam-heated coaches . Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the new HEP-equipped Amfleet I coaches , designed for short runs , into service . The new EMD F40PH , intended for short-distance service and equipped with HEP , handled these trains .",
      "In the spring of 1977 Amtrak faced a power crisis . In addition to the SDP40Fs derailing , Amtrak was having trouble with two other six-axle designs . The GE E60CP and E60CH electric locomotives were having derailment problems . The GE P30CH had the same truck design as E60s and rode poorly , although it did not exhibit the same tendency to derail . Amtrak decided to abandon the SDP40F in favor of the F40PH , a four-axle design with none of the riding problems of the six-axle locomotives . Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD . Components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PHs frame . Between 1977\u20131987 Amtrak traded 132 of the SDP40Fs back to EMD for F40PHRs . The SDP40F remained in service on the Santa Fe longer than elsewhere , although the arrival of HEP-equipped Superliner cars on the Western routes displaced them from there as well . The last SDP40Fs left the Amtrak roster in 1987 . The remaining Amtrak SDP40Fs that werent sold to the ATSF ( seen below ) are presumed to have been scrapped .",
      "Freight use .",
      "In 1984 Amtrak , low on light-duty power , traded 18 SDP40Fs to the Santa Fe for 43 switchers : 25 CF7s and 18 SSB1200s . Santa Fe rebuilt the traded locomotives for freight use . Modifications included removing the steam generators and regearing for lower speed . The locomotives were also given front steps and platforms , and notched noses in order to improve boarding access . The rebuilt locomotives were designated SDF40-2 . The SDF40-2s continued in service with the BNSF Railway , successor to the Santa Fe , until their retirement in 2002 .",
      "Preservation .",
      "One SDF40-2 , ex-Amtrak No . 644 , was acquired by Dynamic Rail Preservation Inc . and is in Boulder City , Nevada having been previously displayed in Ogden , Utah . It has been renumbered to its Santa Fe-era 6976 number and returned to operation in November 2019 .",

      "John Plumbe",
      "John Plumbe Jr . ( occasionally Plumb ; July 13 , 1809 \u2013 May 29 , 1857 ) was a Welsh-born American entrepreneurial photographer , gallerist , publisher , and an early advocate of an American transcontinental railroad in the mid-19th century . He established a franchise of photography studios in the 1840s in the U.S. , with additional branches in Paris and Liverpool . He created a lithographic process for reproducing photographic images , called the plumbeotype .",
      "Biography .",
      "Plumbe was born in Castle Caereinion , Powys , Wales in 1809 , to John Plumbe and Frances Margaretta Atherton . The family moved to Philipsburg , Pennsylvania in 1821 , and later to Dubuque , Iowa .",
      "Vision for a transcontinental railroad .",
      "He began his career as a civil engineer . He studied civil engineering while still in his late teens and by 1829 was surveying sites for future railroad routes in the southern and eastern portions of the country . About 1836 he relocated to the Wisconsin territory , where he became and advocate for a trans-contintental railroad . Plumbe reasoned that a transcontintental railroad would hasten the formation of dense settlements throughout the whole extent of the road , advance the sales of the public lands , afford increased facilities to the agricultural , commercial and mining interests of the country...and enable the government to transport troops and munitions of war .",
      "Throughout his life Plumbe would continue to press for the railroad , petitioning Congress and presenting his ideas in various newspapers and other publications .",
      "Daguerreotype galleries , 1840-1847 .",
      "Plumbe took up photography in 1840 after seeing the work of an itinerant daguerreotypist in Washington , D.C.\u2014probably the work of John G . Stevenson .",
      "In a short period of time , Plumbe established a string of daguerreotype studios and galleries , all bearing his name . Visitors to the galleries could view photographic works , receive training , or pay to have their portrait taken . Images produced in the Plumbe studios were credited to Plumbe , although the work was made by others , including his brother Richard Plumbe . Each of his galleries was staffed by a host of operators , colorists , and artisans , and many notable daguerreotypists received their training or honed their skills in Plumbes galleries , including Richard Carr , Marsena Cannon , Charles E . Johnson , Jacob Shew , Myron Shew , and William Shew . Others who learnt photographic arts through the Plumbe franchise included Ezra Chase , Samuel Masury , C.S . Middlebrook , and Gabriel Harrison .",

      "Public Diplomacy Council of Catalonia",
      "The Public Diplomacy Council of Catalonia ( in Catalan language Consell de Diplom\u00e0cia P\u00fablica de Catalunya ; acronym : DIPLOCAT ) \u2013 previously known as the Patronat Catalunya M\u00f3n \u2013 is a public-private consortium set up by the Catalan government , the Generalitat . It is devoted to promoting international awareness of Catalonia within the international community through public diplomacy tools . Albert Royo i Marin\u00e9 was the secretary general of the Diplomacy Council from 14 February 2013 to October 27 , 2017 when the government of Spain decided to close the consortium in application of article 155 of the Spanish Constitution . Its creation has been controversial , since the constitution reserves external action to the government of Spain exclusively . With the arrival of the new government of the Generalitat , the President Quim Torra convened the first meeting of its board of trustees since the beginning of the process of liquidation . With this announcement , the liquidation of the consortium was terminated and the process of reactivation started . In December 2018 its board of trustees appointed Ms . Laura Foraster as the new secretary general of Diplocat .",
      "Activities .",
      "From 2013 to 2017 DIPLOCAT organized academic events to discuss both internationally relevant topics within Catalonia with international guests and the Catalan independence process in universities around the world . Examples of these events include debates in Lisbon , Utrecht , Oslo , Cambridge , Princeton , Sciences Po Paris , Stockholm and Tokyo .",
      "Diplocat also organized public events in Catalonia itself . In that sense , Diplocat invited Jeremy Rifkin to talk about the possibilities for Catalonia to implement the third industrial revolution , and also organized an international forum in Barcelona about reception and integration of refugees in the European Union .",
      "It also published articles in international press to explain the political situation in Catalonia ; awards grants ; organized an executive masters degree in diplomacy and foreign affairs ; organized meetings with foreign members of parliaments to promote debate on the question of the right to decide ; invited well-known figures from different fields of work or studies to visit Catalonia ; participated in electoral observation missions ; aided civil society organizations carrying out activities abroad ; prepares informative documents explaining key aspects of everything related to Catalonia ; and carried out digital diplomacy with activity on social networks - especially Twitter .",
      "They also carried out activities in the field of cultural diplomacy , such as the #BooksAndRoses campaign , which promotes giving roses and books in and around April 23 , when Sant Jordi is celebrated in Catalonia , or supporting documentaries such as the one about the 40 years of Dutch soccer player Johann Cruyff in Catalonia .",
      "DIPLOCAT also gave the annual Catalan Business Diplomacy Award , aimed at recognizing those companies which identify themselves or their products and services as Catalan . The award was first created in 2013 by DIPLOCAT working together with PIMEC . It has been won by Aranow ( 2013 ) , Scytl ( 2014 ) , Moritz ( 2015 ) , Ultram\u00e0gic ( 2016 ) and Beabloo ( 2017 ) . With Diplocat reactivated the award was restored and the company Munich was awarded in 2019 .",
      "One of the first activities held by Diplocat once reactivated was a seminar on public diplomacy in Barcelona in which professor Nicholas Cull gave the key speech . In that conference the new secretary general Ms . Laura Foraster said that Diplocats goals are to export the image , assets and values of Catalonia abroad .",
      "Impact in international journalism .",
      "The presence of DIPLOCAT has been acknowledged to improve the positive perceptions on Catalonia of the international journalists who had previously established contact with the consortium . Moreover , there is a correlation between the professional needs of correspondents ( information sources and materials ) and the Public Diplomacy activities being provided by DIPLOCAT .",

      "The LMS Ivatt Class 4 2-6-0 is a class of steam locomotive primarily designed for medium freight work but also widely used on secondary passenger services .",
      "The London Midland and Scottish Railway ( LMS ) built 162 of this type between 1947 and 1952 , but only three were built by the LMS before nationalisation in 1948 . Designed by H.G . Ivatt , they were classified 4F by the LMS and 4MT by BR . In BR days they were used extensively across the system , being prevalent on the London Midland region and to a lesser extent elsewhere , notably on the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway , an East Anglian line that had previously been joint owned by the LMS and LNER , where they became the dominant locomotive type . They were also used for a short period on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway , but were quickly transferred elsewhere , never to return , because of poor steaming on the lines long and steep gradients \u2013 this was before modifications were made to the design which improved steaming notably .",
      "Numbering .",
      "The first three engines were numbered 3000\u20133002 by the LMS , but became 43000\u201343002 when renumbered by BR \u2013 40000 was added to the running number to indicate an ex-LMS locomotive . The remaining 159 , built by BR , continued the number sequence : 43003\u201343161 . Construction was divided between different locations , 75 were completed at Horwich Works , 50 at Doncaster Works and 37 at Darlington Works . The class was also sometimes called mucky ducks or doodlebugs or even flying pigs .",
      "Design .",
      "The design was noted for its American looks \u2013 the running-plates were positioned at a high level and a gap left ahead of the cylinders . Because of this many locomotive enthusiasts considered it to be the ugliest British locomotive produced , especially those locomotives outshopped with double chimneys ( the first 50 engines ) ; however , these gave poor performance and were quickly replaced with single chimneys . The locomotives also incorporated new mechanical features intended to reduce maintenance costs . The utilitarian appearance was a deliberate design decision as there are sketches which show the locomotive with conventional curved running plates .",
      "The BR Standard Class 4 2-6-0 was based on this design . Its looks were improved somewhat by the re-design of the outside foot-plating , to include a sloping plate to fill the gap ahead of the cylinders .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "- On 15 November 1964 , locomotive No . 43072 was hauling a freight train which ran away and crashed at Adolphus Street Goods Yard , Bradford , Yorkshire . The locomotive was subsequently scrapped in situ .",
      "Withdrawal .",
      "The class were withdrawn between 1963 and 1968 .",
      "Preservation .",
      "Only one example survived into preservation , No 43106 , the final member of the class in service , which was based at Lostock Hall depot , near Preston . Its last operational turn was just before Easter in 1968 , but its last turn was interrupted by a derailment in Colne Goods Yard . Since 43106 had already been selected as the best of the remaining small group , a search party was despatched on Easter Tuesday to survey the damage . It was felt that damage was so minimal the prospective owners would investigate the ease of a repair .",
      "On its return to Lostock Hall , the locomotive was repaired by fitters from Carnforth , that repair exists to this day . However it derailed again at Lostock Hall when being prepared for a test run in late July .",
      "It was steamed for the final time by British Railways on 1 August 1968 and departed at about 15:30 with one member of its new owning consortium on board . This was only after lengthy discussions to get the locomotive moved in live steam before 4 August , the end of steam operation on BR . The journey was carefully routed to limit movement under the wires , via Frodsham , Chester and Shrewsbury . The journey through the West Midlands continued via Wolverhampton High Level towards Bescot and Pleck Junction , where after a movement around a triangular junction to ensure it arrived the right way round the light engine continued on to Stourbridge Junction where it was stabled overnight in the exchange sidings , now part of the extensive car park .",
      "On 2 August it continued on to its new life in preservation on the Severn Valley Railway appearing on the front page of the Shropshire Journal with three of its new owners giving it a much needed clean . It is affectionately known as the Flying Pig , although many railwaymen referred to the Ivatt 4s as Doodlebugs .",
      "Between 1975 and 1983 no 43106 saw use on the mainline hauling railtours . In 1975 it attended the Rail 150 celebrations in Shildon & in 1980 it took part in the Rocket 150 celebrations at Rainhill . On a small number of occasions between 1980 and 1983 the engine saw use on a limited number of railtours , on some occasions double heading with fellow SVR based engines including : 5000 , 7812 Erlestoke Manor & 80079 .",
      "A major overhaul of the locomotive was completed in 2009 and it is currently operational after having damage repaired that it received during a derailment at Hampton Loade soon after returning to service .

      "The World Union for Progressive Judaism ( WUPJ ) is the international umbrella organization for the various branches of Reform , Liberal and Progressive Judaism , as well as the separate Reconstructionist Judaism . The WUPJ is based in 40 countries with 1,275 affiliated synagogues , of which 1,170 are Reform , Progressive or Liberal and 105 Reconstructionist . It claims to represent a total of some 1.8 million people , both registered constituents and non-member identifiers . The WUPJ states that it aims to create common ground between its constituents and to promote Progressive Judaism in places where individuals and groups are seeking authentic , yet modern ways of expressing themselves as Jews . It seeks to preserve Jewish integrity wherever Jews live , to encourage integration without assimilation , to deal with modernity while preserving the Jewish experience and to strive for equal rights and social justice .",
      "The WUPJ was established in London in 1926 as the Union of all Progressive ( also Liberal or Reform ) movements . It moved its headquarters to New York in 1959 and to Jerusalem in 1973 . In 1990 , the Reconstructionists \u2013 who espouse a philosophy different from that of the former \u2013 joined the WUPJ under an observer status , being the first and only non-Reform member . The WUPJ has regional offices in London , Moscow and New York City .",
      "As of September 2014 the President of the WUPJ is Rabbi Daniel H . Freelander , and the Chair is Carole Sterling . Past presidents included Claude Montefiore ( 1926-1938 ) , Rabbi Leo Baeck ( 1938-1956 ) , Lily Montagu ( 1955\u20131959 ) , and Rabbi Solomon Freehof ( 1959-1964 ) .",
      "Mission statement .",
      "- The establishment and support of synagogues and schools wherever there are Jews searching for meaningful access to modern Jewish life .",
      "- Recruitment , training and placement of rabbis , cantors and educators .",
      "- Publication and distribution of liturgical and educational materials in languages Jews speak .",
      "- Sponsorship of international programs for youth , education , leadership development , and all aspects of community building .",
      "- Bringing together like-minded Jews to derive strength from one another...blending ancient traditions with the changing world of today .",
      "Regional affiliates .",
      "North America .",
      "The URJ is by far the largest member organization of the WUPJ , with a solid constituency of over 750,000 Jewish members ( along with further 90,000 unconverted gentile spouses ) and over a million non-members who identify with it in the U.S. , and further 30,000 constituents in Canada . As of 2016 , 1.5 million of the 1.9 million members of WUPJ are in the U.S .",
      "German immigrants and rabbis brought Reform to America , although a short-lived congregation that espoused a somewhat similar ideal existed in Charleston between 1824 and 1833 . The Union of American Hebrew Congregations , URJ since 2003 , was founded in 1873 .",
      "North America is also home to the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation , which has affiliates , 97 only Five of them outside the continent ( in Delft , Netherlands , Cura\u00e7ao ; Wiesbaden , Germany ; Serrastretta , Italy ; Moscow , Russia ) . The JRF joined as an observer in 1990 . It is the only non-Reform organization in the WUPJ , the other members of which do uphold the basic tenets of ongoing revelation , personal God and the like . In 2013 , it had some 65,000 constituents .",
      "United Kingdom .",
      "Claude Montefiore , a major theologian , named his religious ideology Liberal Judaism , founding the Jewish Religious Union as a platform in 1902 . His movement was a founding member of the WUPJ in 1926 . British Reform , established officially in 1942 , joined the global organization in 1945 .",
      "Israel .",
      "A first congregation was formed at Jerusalem during 1958 . The movement was incorporated in 1971 . The Israeli surrounding encouraged a more conservative approach on behalf of the local branch . The prayer in vernacular , for example , was Hebrew anyway , and the populace was relatively more familiar with rabbinic sources . Patrilineal descent is not recognized by the IMPJ , as by many other smaller affiliates , which cannot antagonize the Israeli Orthodox religious establishment .",
      "South Africa .",
      "The movement was established in 1931 with the encouragement of Abraham Zevi Idelsohn and Lily Montagu . South African Jewry is mostly nominally Orthodox , with those in Progressive streams accounting for around 10% of South African Jews currently residing in the country .",
      "Australia , New Zealand and Asia .",
      "The movement was established in the 1930s in Melbourne by Ada Phillips with the encouragement of Lily Montagu and Israel Mattuck . Australian Jewry is similar to its South African counterpart in that it is mostly nominally Orthodox . Around twenty percent of affiliated Jews in Australia belong to progressive congregations .",
      "Continental Europe .",
      "Reform Judaism began in Germany , led by Rabbi Abraham Geiger . It stagnated considerably after the 1840s . In 1898 , German Liberal rabbis organized the Union of Liberal Rabbis in Germany under Heinemann Vogelstein . In 1908 the laity formed the Union for Liberal Judaism in Germany . At its height , it had some 10,000 members and half the rabbis in the country . The ULJ was a founding member of the World Union in 1926 . After the destruction of the Holocaust , Germanys Jews , mostly refugees of foreign descent , largely favoured Orthodoxy . Liberal Judaism managed to gain inroads slowly , and first prayer groups appeared in 1995 . The Union of Progressive Jews was founded in 1997 .",
      "The first new branch established by the WUPJ was in the Netherlands , in 1931 , eventually coalescing into the Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom .",
      "The movement is growing in Spain . As of 2016 there are six congregations , while there was only one congregation a decade ago . In 2017 the Reform community there expects to have its first native-born rabbi since the Expulsion in 1492 once he completes his rabbinical training in London .",
      "Latin America .",
      "Since the early 2000s , a Latin American affiliate has been evolving . Officially founded at the Leaders Regional Conference of Progressive Communities in C\u00f3rdoba ( Argentina ) , in December 2009 , then WUPJ-Latin America renamed itself the Union for Reform Judaism - Latin America ( UJR-AmLat , the acronym in Spanish and Portuguese ) in 2019 .",
      "The main concern of the time in the early 2000s was the vulnerability of the Jewish communities of Argentina , which was going through a serious social , economic and political crisis . The embryo of the organization was conceived in 2002 in S\u00e3o Paulo , by activists from liberal communities of Brazil , who chose that city as the regional headquarters of the organization .",
      "As of June 2020 , UJR-AmLat has 26 affiliated communities , being one Rabbinical Institute , one Jewish School ( both in Buenos Aires ) , two youth movements ( affiliated to Netzer Olami ) in S\u00e3o Paulo , and 22 synagogues in Brazil , Argentina , Chile , Ecuador , Peru , Costa Rica , and Guatemala .",

The following ten locos had the similar per hour type OK4616B and a reduced water capacity of , and this was perpetuated in the remaining production run which used the Stone Vapour per hour type L4610 boiler . These variations meant that the initial batch of 20 locomotives tipped the scales at ; the following 10 locomotives slightly lower at ; the remainder of the Class 24/0 at ; and the Class 24/1 at exactly . During subsequent years the boilers were removed from the majority of Class 24/1 locomotives , reducing the overall weight by . Ten locomotives ( D5102\u20135111 ) had no train heating , the space being occupied by the air compressors needed for operation of the Consett iron ore trains .",
      "Other systems .",
      "Several of the systems within the class 24s were standard . The braking system was the standard BR system , adopted as part of the Modernisation Plan , of locomotive air and train vacuum brake , both applied by a single handle via a proportional valve . Similarly , the connection for multiple working was the standard electro-pneumatic system designated Blue Star with each loco bearing a small blue coloured 5-pointed star above each buffer to denote this . Also common was the provision of a door to allow staff to pass between locomotives , or between a locomotive and adjacent coach . In practice , these were rarely used and were sealed shut at overhaul during the 1970s to reduce draughts in the cab .",
      "With production reaching 151 there were some differences between batches of locos too . Ten of the initial twenty had Athermos pressure-lubricated plain bearing axleboxes rather than the more usual roller-bearing axleboxes . Although these remained for the life of the locos they were the only ones so fitted . Much more noticeable were D5114\u2013D5132 which were fitted with tablet catchers on the side of the drivers cab for use on the Far North Line from Inverness . Also very visible were the roof-mounted headcode boxes fitted from D5114 giving an outward appearance very similar to the later Class 25 but without horn grilles .",
      "External condition .",
      "Liveries .",
      "The pilot scheme locomotives were delivered in overall green livery with a grey roof and black below the body . D5000 was delivered with a narrow light grey stripe at waist level while the remainder had a broad light grey stripe at solebar level . This light grey stripe may have appeared bluish and has been described as pale blue or eggshell , but in most illustrations , it appears to be off-white . At first , green liveried locos had plain green ends , but this was changed from 1962 to small yellow warning panels , and then from 1967 to full yellow ends , some locos receiving these while still in green livery . At least five locos were repainted in two-tone green livery ( applied along with the small yellow warning panel ) in a similar manner to Class 47s and some Class 25s .",
      "The first class 24 painted in Rail Blue livery was D5068 in December 1966 , and repainting continued into the mid-1970s , although some locomotives were withdrawn before being painted in this colour .",
      "Alterations .",
      "As with many large classes of locomotive , there were some variations during the Class 24s lifetime , some affecting all of the class ( nominally ) , and others just individual locos . One such locomotive was 24133 , one of the last survivors of the class and easily recognised as it had different headcode boxes on each end , the standard one for the class at one end and that at the other end matching those used on the Class 27 . This was not unique , as 24145 had a headcode box similar to those fitted to later batches of Class 25s . In each case , this is likely to be due to collision damage repairs . Some Inverness-based locomotives had car lights fitted to each nose . These were after-market car headlamps mounted in the plated-over nose doors , to provide extra visibility to users of level crossings on sharply curved branch lines . D5114-132 had pairs mounted in each nose . These were removed between 1975/6 , with small plates welded over the apertures . 12 Class 26s had similar modifications , some having pairs and others having a single lamp . Examples of Class 37s , class 47s and a solitary class 86 had single railway spotlights installed at each end but the class 24s and class 26s were the only ones fitted with proper car headlamps .",
      "In 1960 D5008 was fitted with a Pressure-charging Protection Unit which was designed to prevent the engine from running continuously above the smoke limit . The unit failed on one occasion allowing significant smoke emission , and in general did not demonstrate any significant impact on the amount of visible smoke emitted . The unit was subsequently removed .",
      "Operation .",
      "Initial deliveries were for operation in the Crewe and Derby areas , but fifteen of the initial twenty were diverted for use on the Southern Region to cover for delays in the Kent Coast Electrification scheme . Here the heavy weight was not acceptable and the locos in question had to have their boilers removed before they were accepted . Later some locos had their boilers re-fitted and these examples could be found , often in tandem with a Class 33 to provide steam heating to the coaches , the 33s only having electric train heat ( ETH ) .",
      "As deliveries continued allocations were made to both the London Midland Region and Eastern Region , and with the class becoming familiar to crews and staff around London they were used on freight trains over the Metropolitan Widened Lines , locos so used being fitted with London Transport tripcocks \u2013 although these were removed after closure of this route in 1971 . Locos allocated to East Anglia for use on freight soon became redundant due to the rundown of freight in that region , and these were , in turn , moved to Wales and Lancashire .",
      "Class 24s took over the Condor fast freight service between London ( Hendon ) and Glasgow ( Gushetfaulds ) in 1961 , the train having previously been hauled by the Metro-Vic Co-Bo locos for which it is best remembered . Thus the class was also used when a second Condor fast overnight freight service was introduced , running from Aston to Glasgow . These were the usual motive power from its introduction on 17 January 1963 when D5082 hauled the Down train and D5083 the up train until replaced by the first Freightliner service in 1965 .",
      "The batch D5096\u2013D5113 were all allocated to Gateshead depot in 1966 to replace 9F steam locos on the Tyne Dock to Consett iron ore trains . These workings used a special design of bogie hopper wagon , and these locos had an additional compressor and associated pipework . These workings , typically with loads of around 1,000 tons , were double-headed and continued until taken over by Class 37s in the 1970s , when these locos were reallocated to Scottish depots . Incidentally D5096 was , when delivered in January 1960 , the first main line diesel locomotive to be built at Darlington Works .",
      "The next batch of locos , D5114\u2013D5132 , were allocated to Inverness , and became synonymous with rail operations in the Scottish Highlands , as did a similar batch of Class 26 locos , the two being considered interchangeable in operation . Single Class 24s operated from Inverness on passenger and freight trains of up to 290 tons , and double-headed on trains up to 580 tons including the Royal Highlander which was regularly made up of 16 coaches . Class 24s and Class 26s were used turn and turn about until all Class 24s allocated to Inverness were replaced by Class 26s in 1975 .",
      "The final batch of Class 24s were allocated to the London Midland Region for use on the Western Lines which covered North Wales and Mid Wales . In the latter area , particularly on the ex-Cambrian Railways lines , Class 24s and the similar Class 25s were the only diesel types to be found , and crews from Aberystwyth shed were only trained on these types . This proved to be an issue on summer Saturdays , and after problems with timekeeping and failures in service , heavier trains were double-headed or hauled by the more powerful Class 40 locomotives between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth .",
      "Departmental use .",
      "In November 1975 , 24061 was transferred to BRs research department based at Derby Works , and was allocated the number RDB968007 . This loco was subsequently renumbered as 97201 and was finally withdrawn on 4 December 1987 , the last Class 24 to be operational on BR .",
      "After withdrawal in 1976 two Class 24s were converted into train pre-heating units and were allocated to the Western Region : 24054 was withdrawn in August and became TDB968008 , being allocated to Newton Abbot until withdrawn in October 1982 ; 24142 became TDB968009 and was allocated to Landore .",
      "Withdrawal .",
      "The very first Class 24 to be withdrawn was in November 1967 when a fire broke out on D5051 while it was working a train of empty coal wagons in Scotland . The damage was too severe for it to be repaired , and it was cut up at Inverurie in August 1968 . It had lasted exactly 8 years . The second Class 24 to be withdrawn was also as the result of an accident in Scotland , this time at Castlecary . In this case D5122 , running light engine , hit a stationary DMU at about , the impact and subsequent fire bending the main frames and completely destroying the No.2 end . The accident happened on 9 September 1968 but despite being withdrawn the same month , the locomotive was not finally cut up until March 1971 . A total of 14 Class 24s were withdrawn and scrapped without receiving their TOPS number .",
      "Some Class 24s were withdrawn in 1973 with the closure of the Waverley route , which linked and Edinburgh , but most of these were put into storage and subsequently re-entered traffic to fill gaps left by the movement of Class 25s to cover the withdrawal of Class 22s on the Western Region . Thus Class 24 withdrawals only started in earnest with completion of the Glasgow electrification in 1974 , and re-allocation of Class 26 and Class 27 locos saw the Class 24s concentrated around various Lancashire depots and at Carlisle . On 27 November 1976 there were just ten Class 24s still in operational service , all allocated to Crewe Diesel Depot ( depot code CD ) . However , with the reinstatement of 24082 and 24073 this number climbed to 12 by February 1977 .",
      "In January 1978 two farewell railtours were run \u2013 24082 and 24087 hauled the Merseyside Express from London St Pancras to Liverpool and return on the 14th , and 24087 and 24133 hauled the Cambrian Coast Express from Birmingham to Aberystwyth and Barmouth on the 28th . On the latter trip , 24087 failed on the outward journey , was dumped at Machynlleth on the return journey and never worked again .",
      "On 21 January , 24133 had also taken part in the Farewell to the 44s tour , providing steam heating for the coaches while 44008 Penyghent provided the motive power , on the Crewe to Chester leg of a circular tour from London .",
      "For the summer of 1978 , six class 24s remained in service \u2013 24023 , 035 , 047 , 063 , 081 and 082 . In May , a North Wales DMU passenger diagram was converted to loco haulage on Mondays to Fridays , comprising the 09:42 Llandudno - Manchester , 13:30 return , 16:42 Llandudno - Crewe , 20:30 Crewe - Bangor and 22.45 Bangor - Llandudno Junction . At least five different class 24s were recorded on this diagram during the summer . Additionally , on Saturday 10 June , 24082 worked a Llandudno Junction \u2013 London Euston relief train all the way to London due to a lack of a replacement loco at Crewe .",
      "By January 1979 , only three locos remained in use \u2013 24063 , 081 and 082 . 24082 was withdrawn on 1 March and 24063 on 9 April , leaving 24081 the last in service . The final recorded passenger duty of a Class 24 was on 2 August 1979 when 24081 rescued 40129 at Colwyn Bay on the 18:05 Holyhead \u2013 Euston , hauling the train as far as Crewe .",
      "Cutting up of some Class 24s was carried out at Swindon Works on the Western Region , an area which had never received an allocation of Class 24s . The first locos were 24042 , 24045 , 24048 and 24050 which were moved from Derby Works in December 1975 , and the last of the 67 Class 24s cut up at Swindon was 24084 in early December 1978 .",
      "The very last Class 24 to be withdrawn from operational service was 24081 . This loco , allocated to Crewe Diesel Depot had been considered something of a celebrity lasting over a year after the previous withdrawal of 24063 on 9 April 1979 . 24081 was finally withdrawn in October 1980 having worked its last revenue earning train , the 05.43 Grange - Shotwick freight on 7 January 1980 , and then making guest appearances at Nuneaton , Crewe Works Open Day , and Southport .",

      "Pat Sullivan ( film producer )",
      "Patrick Peter Pat Sullivan ( 22 February 1885 \u2013 15 February 1933 ) was an Australian-American cartoonist , pioneer animator , and film producer best known for producing the first Felix the Cat silent cartoons .",
      "Early life .",
      "Sullivan was born in Paddington , New South Wales , the second son of Patrick Sullivan , an immigrant from Ireland and his Sydney-born wife Margaret , n\u00e9e Hayes .",
      "Around 1909 , Sullivan left Australia and spent a few months in London , England , before moving to the United States around 1910 . He worked as assistant to newspaper cartoonist William Marriner and drew four strips of his own . When Marriner died in 1914 , Sullivan joined the new animated cartoon studio set up by Raoul Barr\u00e9 . In 1915 , Sullivan was fired by Barre for general incompetence . In 1916 , William Randolph Hearst , the newspaper magnate , set up a studio to produce animated cartoons based on his papers strips and hired Barres best animators . Sullivan decided to start his own studio and made a series called Sammy Johnsin based on a Marriner strip on which he had worked . This was followed by a series of shorts starring The Tramp .",
      "As Mickey Mouse was gaining popularity among theatre audiences through sound cartoons by late 1928 , Sullivan , after years of refusing to convert Felix to sound , finally agreed to use sound in Felixs cartoons . Unfortunately , Sullivan did not carefully prepare this process and put sound in cartoons that the studio had already completed . By 1930 , Felix had faded from the screen . Sullivan relented in 1933 , and announced that Felix would return in sound , but died that year before production began .",
      "By the early 1930s , Sullivans alcoholism had completely consumed him . According to artist George Cannata , Sulivan would often fire employees in a drunken haze , not remembering the next day , when they would return to work as if nothing had happened . According to Shamus Culhane , Sullivan artist Al Eugster recalled that Sullivan was [ t ] he most consistent man in the business\u2014consistent in that he was never sober . According to Otto Messmer , Sullivan drank all day long and was never in a sound enough state of mind to contribute creatively to the cartoons he produced . In later years , much of Sullivans staff was interviewed and claimed Messmer deserved all credit for the Felix characters creation and development , arguing that Sullivan was too sick to contribute or even really run the studio .",
      "Death .",
      "Sullivan died on 15 February 1933 in New York City at age 47 from health problems brought on by alcoholism and pneumonia . ( At the time , newspapers attributed his death to only pneumonia. ) He is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton , Pennsylvania .",
      "Character creations .",
      "- Felix the Cat ( disputed )",
      "- Great Idea Jerry",
      "- Old Pop Perkins",
      "- Johnny Boston Beans",
      "- Obliging Oliver",
      "Controversies .",
      "Rape conviction .",
      "In 1917 , Sullivan was convicted of rape in the second degree of a 14-year-old girl . He spent 9 months and 3 days in prison , during which time his studio went on hiatus .",
      "Racism .",
      "Sullivan reportedly carried a strong bias against African Americans . According to Rudy Zamora , when he and Eddie Salter tested for positions at the Sullivan studio , they were bested by a young African American boy . Zamora recalled that animator Dana Parker took the black boy [ aside ] and told him that they\u2019ll call him when they needed him , [ as they were ] not hiring anyone that day . But they kept Eddie and I . That was lousy . Then they would have hired this black guy and myself . Ed was third . When Zamora complained about this to Parker , he was told , The old man ( Sullivan ) didn\u2019t want any black guys .",
      "Involvement in the creation of Felix the Cat .",
      "It is a matter of some dispute whether Felix was created by Sullivan or his top animator Otto Messmer . Some animation historians accepted Messmers claim , as he was the principal animator on the Felix series .",
      "However , Sullivan was drawing cartoons for Paramount Magazine by 1919 and later when he signed a contract as an animator with Paramount Studios in March 1920 , one of the subjects specified in his curriculum vitae was a black cat named Felix who had first appeared in Paramount Magazine as a character named Master Tom in a cartoon series named Feline Follies , tending to support Sullivans claim definitively .",
      "Firsthand accounts were recorded in print , notably a recollection from 1953 by Australian writer Hugh McCrae , who was sharing an apartment with Pat Sullivan just before Felix was created . It comes properly as a postscript that in New York McCrae shared a flat with Pat Sullivan , the famed creator of Felix , the Cat . When a film about Felix was being planned , Sullivan suggested that McCrae should do the drawings while he ( Sullivan ) supplied the ideas . McCrae refused and has regretted it ever since .",
      "Australian cartoonists find the Messmer claim not credible . Messmer came forward decades after Pat Sullivans death , claimed Felix was his creation and placed the place of creation of the lucrative character in his own house , away from his bosss office . He excluded Pat Sullivan completely , and yet the lettering throughout the creation matches Pat Sullivans hand . It is also telling that a cartoon kitten says MUM in Feline Follies , with the Australian/British spelling , rather than MOM , the American spelling ; Messmer is less likely to have written that .",

      "Emirate of Diriyah",
      "The Emirate of Diriyah ( ) , also transliterated as the Emirate of Diriyah and also known as the First Saudi State , was established in the year 1744 ( 1157 AH ) when the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and tribal chief Muhammad bin Saud formed an alliance to found a socio-religious reform movement to unify the many states of the Arabian Peninsula . In 1744 , both Abd al-Wahhab and Saud took an oath to achieve their goal .",
      "Early establishment .",
      "The House of Saud and its allies quickly rose to become the dominant power in Arabia by first conquering Najd , and then expanding their influence over the eastern coast from Kuwait down to the northern borders of Oman . Furthermore , Sauds forces brought the highlands of Asir under their suzerainty , while Muhammad ibn Abd Al Wahhab wrote letters to people and scholars to enter the field of jihad . After many military campaigns , Muhammad bin Saud died in 1765 , leaving the leadership to his son , Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad . Sauds forces went so far as to gain command of the Shia holy city of Karbala in 1801 . Here they destroyed the shrine of the saints and monuments and killed over 5000 civilians . In retribution , Abdulaziz was assassinated by a young Shia in 1803 , having followed him back to Nejd .",
      "Muhammad bin Abd Al Wahhab died in 1792 . In 1803 , eleven years after Wahhabs death , the son of Abdulaziz bin Muhammad , Saud bin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud , sent out forces to bring the region of Hejaz under his rule . Taif was the first city to be captured , and later the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina . This was seen as a major challenge to the authority of the Ottoman Empire , which had exercised its rule over the holy cities since 1517 .",
      "Decline of sovereignty .",
      "The task of weakening the grip of the House of Saud was given to the powerful viceroy of Egypt , Muhammad Ali Pasha , by the Ottomans . This initiated the Ottoman\u2013Saudi War , in which Muhammad Ali sent his troops to the Hejaz region by sea . His son , Ibrahim Pasha , then led Ottoman forces into the heart of Nejd , capturing town after town . Sauds successor , his son Abdullah bin Saud , was unable to prevent the recapture of the region . Finally , Ibrahim reached the Saudi capital at Diriyah and placed it under siege for several months until it surrendered in the winter of 1818 . Ibrahim then shipped off many members of the clans of Al Saud and Muhammed Ibn Abd Al Wahhab to Egypt and the Ottoman capital , Istanbul . Abdullah bin Saud was later executed in the Ottoman capital Istanbul with his severed head later thrown into the waters of the Bosphorus , marking the end of what was known as the First Saudi State . However , both the Wahhabi sect and the remaining members of the Al Saud clan stayed committed . They founded a Second Saudi State that lasted until 1891 , and later a third state , Saudi Arabia , which the Al Saud continue to rule up to the present day .",

      "Villa del Balbianello",
      "The Villa del Balbianello is a villa in the comune of Lenno ( province of Como ) , a province in the north of the Lombardy region of Italy , overlooking Lake Como . It is located on the tip of the small wooded peninsula of Dosso dAvedo on the western shore of the south-west branch of Lake Como , not far from the Isola Comacina and is famous for its elaborate terraced gardens .",
      "History .",
      "A Franciscan monastery had existed on the tip of the peninsula of Dosso dAvedo since the 13th century . The two towers which remain on the property are the remnants of the campanili of the monasterys church .",
      "After failing in his attempts to buy the nearby Isola Comacina , Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini purchased this property in 1785 . In 1787 , he converted the monastery structure into a villa for use during the summer and added a loggia , which allowed viewers to obtain two different panoramas of the lake .",
      "After the cardinal\u2019s death in 1796 , the villa passed to his nephew , Luigi Porro Lambertenghi . During his ownership , the villa became a center for republican activity and meetings , where Italian patriots and Carbonari met . Among Lambertenghis guests at the villa was the writer Silvio Pellico , who tutored Lambertenghis sons . In 1820 , Pellico was arrested at the villa by the Austrian government and Lambertenghi was forced to move to Belgium , where he was supported by the Arconati-Visconti family . Lambertenghi subsequently sold the villa to his friend , Giuseppe Arconati",
      "Visconti , grandfather of Luchino Visconti .",
      "Visconti made improvements to its gardens and the loggia . To this day the balustrade in front of the church bears the Visconti emblem of a serpent with a man in its mouth . During the period of Visconti ownership , the villa hosted politicians and writers Giovanni Berchet , Alessandro Manzoni , Giuseppe Giusti , as well as the artist Arnold B\u00f6cklin . The gradual decline of the family resulted in a neglect of the villa for more than 30 years .",
      "Just prior to World War I American businessman Butler Ames saw the villa for the first time . He made an offer to purchase it from the Arconati Visconti family and was initially rejected . He kept returning with ever-larger cash offers , until in 1919 he was successful in obtaining ownership . Ames renovated the villa and its garden .",
      "In 1974 , Amess heirs sold the villa to businessman and explorer Count Guido Monzino ( leader of the first Italian expedition to climb Mount Everest ) . While Monzino left the exterior essentially unchanged he had the interior of the villa completely re-decorated , installing artifacts acquired on his expeditions as well as important pieces of English Georgian and French antique furniture from the 18th and 19th centuries , Beauvais tapestries , French boiseries and Oriental carpets . After the assassination of Aldo Moro in 1978 by the Red Brigade , Monzino became worried about his safety , and added a system of hidden passages , linking parts of the property .",
      "Monzino died in 1988 and left the villa along with most of the Dosso dAvedo and an endowment to pay for maintenance , to the Fondo Ambiente Italiano ( FAI ) , the National Trust of Italy . Its grounds now form part of the Grandi Giardini Italiani . Today , the Villa del Balbianello is the most visited among the 52 FAI properties with over 135,000 visitors in 2019 .",
      "In 2016 the Fondo per lAmbiente Italiano commenced a \u20ac413,000 project to restore and improve the villa\u2019s jetty , install new signage , new security , emergency lighting and fire prevention systems . The villas existing diesel fuel system will be replaced with a modern heating system , new visitors bathrooms and drainage systems , and improvements to the bookshop and ticket office space .",
      "In November 2018 Indian movie star and Bollywoods famous couple Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukones wedding took place at the villa .",
      "Film appearances .",
      "A number of feature films have used the villa for location shooting , including A Month by the Lake ( 1995 ) , His Demise starring Paul Zukowski ( 2016 disaster movie ) , Casino Royale ( 2006 ) . The villa was also used for the lake retreat scenes in ( 2002 ) , with computer-generated imagery used in place of the buildings true exterior .",

      "Mu2e , or the Muon-to-Electron Conversion Experiment , is a particle physics experiment at Fermilab in the US . The goal of the experiment is to identify physics beyond the Standard Model , namely , the conversion of muons to electrons without the emission of neutrinos , which occurs in a number of theoretical models . Project co-spokesperson Jim Miller likens this process to neutrino oscillation , but for charged leptons . Observing this process will help to narrow the range of plausible theories . The experiment will be 10,000 times more sensitive than previous muon to electron conversion experiments , and probe energy scales up to 10,000 TeV .",
      "Timeline .",
      "Prior work .",
      "Physicists have been searching for flavor violation since the 1940s . Flavor violation among neutrinos was proven in 1998 at the Super-Kamiokande experiment in Japan .",
      "In 1989 , Russian physicists Vladimir Lobashev and Rashid Djilkibaev proposed an experiment to search for lepton flavor violation . The experiment , called MELC , operated from 1992 to 1995 at the Moscow Meson Factory at the Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia , before being shut down due to the political and economic crises of the time .",
      "In 1997 , American physicist William Molzon proposed a similar experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory . Research and development on the MECO experiment began in 2001 , but funding was pulled in 2005 .",
      "Development .",
      "Mu2e is based on the MECO experiment proposed at Brookhaven , and the earlier MELC experiment at Russias Institute for Nuclear Research . Research and development for the Mu2e experiment began in 2009 , with the conceptual design complete in mid-2011 . In July 2012 , Mu2e received Critical Decision 1 approval ( the second of five critical decision levels ) from the Department of Energy , about one month after initial review . Project Manager Ron Ray asserted , I know of no other project that has received sign-off that quickly after review . Funding of the Mu2e experiment was recommended by the Department of Energys Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel , in its 2014 report .",
      "Construction and operation .",
      "Groundbreaking on the detector hall took place on April 18 , 2015 , with the hall expected to be complete in late 2016 . Commissioning of the experiment is anticipated in 2019 , and preliminary results are possible by around 2020 . The experiment is expected to run for three years .",
      "Later improvements to the detector may increase the sensitivity of the experiment by one to two orders of magnitude , allowing a more in-depth study of any charged lepton conversion that may be discovered in the initial run .",
      "Design .",
      "The Mu2e apparatus will be in length , and will consist of three sections . The total cost of the experiment is $271 million .",
      "Muon production .",
      "Repurposed elements from the Tevatron collider will be used to generate and deliver an 8 GeV proton beam . The protons would be extracted from Fermilabs Delivery Ring through a non-linear third-integer resonance extraction process and sent in pulses to the tungsten target . These protons will then collide with the tungsten production target in the production solenoid , producing a cascade of particles including pions , which decay into muons . Mu2e will produce between 200 and 500 quadrillion ( 2\u00d710 to 5\u00d710 ) muons per year . For every 300 protons hitting the production target , about one muon will enter the transport solenoid .",
      "Transport .",
      "The 4.5-Tesla magnetic field of a production solenoid will direct some of the particles produced into an S-shaped 2-Tesla evacuated transport solenoid , consisting of 50 separate superconducting electromagnets , which will select muons by charge and momentum , and carry the desired slow muons to the detector after some time delay .",
      "Detection .",
      "On entering the detector solenoid , the muons will hit ( and stop within ) an aluminum target that is about 0.2 mm thick , entering orbitals around nuclei within the target . Any muons which convert into electrons without emitting neutrinos will escape these orbitals and enter the detector with a characteristic energy of 104.97 MeV ( which is the muon mass minus the binding energy of about 0.5 MeV and nuclear recoil energy of about 0.2 MeV ) .",
      "The detector itself consists of two components : a straw tracker to measure the momentum of outgoing particles ; and an electromagnetic calorimeter to identify which particle interactions to record for further study , identify what type of particle passed through the tracker , and to confirm the measurements of the tracker . An electron with energy of around 105 MeV will indicate that the electron originated in a neutrinoless muon conversion .",
      "In order to disturb the path of the electrons as little as possible , the tracker uses as little material as possible . The wire chamber tracker consists of panels of 15-micron-thick straws of metalized mylar filled with argon and carbon dioxide , the thinnest such straws ever used in a particle physics experiment . Electronics at each end of the straws will record the signal produced when electrons interact with the gas in the straw , allowing the trajectory of the electrons to be reconstructed .",
      "Sensitivity .",
      "The rate of neutrinoless conversion of muons to electrons was previously constrained by the MEG experiment to less than 2.4\u00d710 , and further constrained to 7\u00d710 by the SINDRUM II experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland . Mu2e has an expected sensitivity of 5\u00d710 , four orders of magnitude beyond SINDRUM II , meaning that it will see a signal if as few as one in 100 quadrillion muons transforms into an electron .",
      "Collaboration .",
      ", the Mu2e collaboration included 240 people from 40 institutions in six countries . The collaboration is led by co-spokespersons Douglas Glenzinski ( Fermilab ) and Jim Miller ( Boston University ) . The project manager for Mu2e is Ron Ray ; the deputy project manager is Julie Whitmore ."

For an extra few coins visitors were allowed to scoop up the authentic pebbles from the grave . Zerelda replenished them from the stream where the boys used to play . Years later when Jesses wife , also named Zerelda , died , his mother had Jesse reburied alongside his wife at Mount Olivet in Kearney , MO . She further would play on the sympathies of her visitors by offering to sell old , rusted , often inoperable guns that she said belonged to Jesse before he died , which in reality she had bought second-hand , leading to a proliferation of people claiming to and sincerely believing that they owned a gun that had once belonged to Jesse James .",

      "2016 .",
      "P\u00e9rez experienced a difficult start to the season for the first four races due to an uncompetitive VJM09 , but scored points with a ninth place in Russia . Upgrades were introduced in Barcelona with a seventh-place finish indicating an improvement in the teams form .",
      "In Monaco , P\u00e9rez scored his sixth ( and Force Indias fourth ) podium finish in wet and changing conditions , and moved to ninth in the Drivers Championship standings . Tyre management played a significant role but in contrast to previous occasions he pitted as many times as Ferrari and Red Bull , at times catching up with the front runners and managing to hold Sebastian Vettel in fourth at a comfortable distance .",
      "In the European Grand Prix in Baku P\u00e9rez once again finished third , recovering from a gearbox change penalty as a result of a crash during free practice , having been fast enough to qualify on the front row . Despite having to start from seventh on the grid he made his way up to fourth before passing Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen on the last lap of the race for third , making it his second podium in three races .",
      "2017 .",
      "After the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix , P\u00e9rez confirmed he has committed to Force India for the 2017 season . He remained with the Indian team for a fourth consecutive season alongside new teammate Esteban Ocon , ending speculation of a possible move to Williams , Renault or Haas . He was very consistent with his highest finish in 2017 a fourth place in Spain after two rivals collided at the start , and a third retired mid-race with a power unit failure . He ended his streak of 17 points finishes as he ended up colliding with Daniil Kvyat in Monaco . He had a moment with his teammate in Canada when he would not allow his teammate through , who thought he could challenge Daniel Ricciardo for 3rd . He was again knocked out in Baku where he thought he could challenge for the win before colliding with Ocon . He finished 7th in Austria and moved up to 6th in the standings after Max Verstappen was out of the race on the first lap . He dropped to 7th in the championship after finishing 9th in Britain , behind his teammate and Verstappen finished 4th . He remained 7th in the standings for the rest of the season .",
      "2018 .",
      "P\u00e9rez finished the first three races of the season outside the points . He then achieved his eighth career podium finish at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix , finishing 3rd after an incident-strewn race . He passed then-championship leader Sebastian Vettel for 3rd place with a few laps to go , making him the first driver to finish on the podium twice at the Baku City Circuit ( in 2016 and 2018 ) . Another points finish came with 9th place in Spain . In France , he retired from the race with an engine failure . Three consecutive points finishes followed , with 7th-place finishes in Austria and Germany .",
      "After the Hungarian Grand Prix , Force India was put into administration . This was caused by a group of creditors ( including P\u00e9rez ) taking legal action against the team . P\u00e9rez said that this action was taken to save the team and its employees from a winding-up order instigated by other creditors , which would have resulted in the teams collapse . Shortly before the Belgian Grand Prix , Force Indias assets were purchased by a consortium of investors led by Lawrence Stroll , father of Williams driver Lance Stroll . The team was re-admitted into the championship as a new team\u2014Racing Point Force India\u2014keeping P\u00e9rez and Ocon as their drivers . At the Belgian Grand Prix , the team came back strong with P\u00e9rez and Ocon qualifying 4th and 3rd , and finishing 5th and 6th , respectively .",
      "P\u00e9rez took seven points finishes from nine races in the second half of the season . However , he faced criticism after a poor performance in Singapore . He collided with his teammate Ocon on the opening lap , causing Ocon to crash into a wall and retire from the race . He also collided with Sergey Sirotkin , an action that resulted in a drive-through penalty . He later stated that he thought his penalty was fair . He later suffered a brake failure and retired from his home race in Mexico . He ended the season in 8th place in the championship with 62 points , finishing ahead of teammate Ocon and being the only non-Mercedes , Ferrari or Red Bull driver to finish on the podium that season .",

      "2019 .",
      "The 2019 season saw Racing Point Force India become Racing Point , retaining P\u00e9rez as a driver . He was joined at the team by former Williams driver Lance Stroll . Racing Point saw 2019 as a transitional season , with much of the work on that years car being disrupted by the administration events of the previous year . A strong start to the season , including a 6th-place finish in Azerbaijan , was followed by a string of eight races without points , the longest such string of his career . This included the rain-affected German Grand Prix , where he crashed out early in the race whilst teammate Stroll briefly led the race and eventually finished 4th .",
      "In a similar manner to 2018 , P\u00e9rez fared far better during the second half of the season . Except for a retirement in Singapore due to an oil leak , he scored points in every race after the summer break , including a strong 6th-place finish in Belgium . Many of these points finishes came from low initial grid positions , including a 7th-place finish in Italy after starting 18th , 8th in Japan from 17th , and 10th in the United States after starting from the pit lane . He finished the season in 10th place in the championship with 52 points , comfortably ahead of teammate Stroll .",

Three days before the , he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19 . Due to this , he was unable to participate in the British Grand Prix . He was temporarily replaced by Nico H\u00fclkenberg . It was confirmed that he would also miss the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix , as he had again tested positive for COVID-19 . After testing negative for COVID-19 after the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix , P\u00e9rez returned to race at the Spanish Grand Prix , he qualified fourth and finished the race in fifth position . In September 2020 , P\u00e9rez announced that he would be leaving Racing Point at the end of the 2020 season . He will be replaced by Sebastian Vettel as Racing Point become Aston Martin for the season .",

P\u00e9rez inherited the lead after Stroll made a pitstop , and on lap 37 he got overtaken by Lewis Hamilton for the lead . The podium was Hamilton , P\u00e9rez and Sebastian Vettel . P\u00e9rez was 3rd for the majority of the Bahrain Grand Prix after starting 5th , but an MGU-K electrical issue struck with only a few laps to go , forcing him to pull over and retire the car with flames billowing out of the power unit .",
      "Since P\u00e9rez announced his departure from Racing Point there was support from the media for him , with The Race saying it will be a huge injustice were Perez not to be on the 2021 grid. . Ex F1 driver turned Sky Sports F1 commentator/pundit Martin Brundle also echoed similar thoughts in his online column review the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where Perez finished second and suggested that Perez should be on Red Bull Racings radar to partner Max Verstappen in place of Alex Albon .",
      "P\u00e9rez won his first race at the Sakhir Grand Prix , becoming Formula 1s 110th race winner . On the first lap P\u00e9rez was hit by Leclerc and went from 2nd place to 18th and last .

      "The London , Brighton and South Coast Railway E4 Class is a class of 0-6-2T side tank steam locomotive designed by Robert Billinton . They were introduced in 1897 and were essentially a larger version of the E3 Class . The cylinder diameter was reduced from by the Southern Railway .",
      "History .",
      "The E4 class of radial tanks were powerful for their size and were stalwarts of local passenger , freight and branch work for more than fifty years . They were very similar to the E3 tank engines from 1891 , but the key differences were that their driving wheels were enlarged from 4 foot 6 inches to 5 foot and their boiler pressure was increased to 160 lb . Several were named after towns , villages and geographical features in the LB&SCR area , for example No . 469 Beachy Head . Some of their names would be re-used for H2 Atlantics a few years later . They were so successful that they were more commonly assigned to passenger trains as opposed to freight work , which is what they were originally intended for . During World War I the Railway Operating Division borrowed several members of the class include Nos . 470 , 481 , 498 , 504 , 506 , 518 , 519 , 562 , 563 , 564 , 565 , 577 and 580 for work in France . They first worked at an ammunition dump in Audruicq , France in November 1917 and were later sent to the Arras area in February 1918 . All of them were returned to England in 1919 . After Grouping they were primarily to be found around the Central section of the Southern Railway , with some going away from their traditional routes to places like Waterloo , Eastleigh and Tonbridge .",
      "Seventy-five members of the class were built by Brighton Works between December 1897 and September 1903 . All of the class survived to enter Southern Railway ownership in 1923 . One example , No . 2483 Hellingly , was severely damaged as a result of enemy action against Eastbourne motive power depot in 1942 during a Luftwaffe air raid event known as the Baedeker Blitz . Hellingly was scrapped in July 1944 . One engine , No . 2510 , was tested on the railways of the Isle of Wright in 1947 , albeit unsuccessfully . The class continued in regular use following the nationalisation of the Southern Railway as part of British Railways in 1948 . However , with the arrival of diesel multiple units and the reduction in the number of branch lines after The Reshaping of British Railways in 1963 , the locomotives gradually became surplus to requirements , and withdrawals commenced in 1955 . Most of the class were withdrawn between 1958 and 1964 .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "- Locomotive No . 32468 ran into the buffers at station , Brighton , East Sussex - date unknown .",
      "Operations .",
      "The E4 class were initially used on local passenger and freight services , and on branch lines .",
      "Later in British Railways days , several examples were found new jobs as station pilots , most famously at London Waterloo , where they brought empty carriage rakes into the station from the yards at Clapham Junction . They were also used on services such as the locally famous Lancing Belle , which ran from Brighton to the Lancing Carriage Works of the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway , often double-headed with members of the same class or the larger E6 class .",
      "Numbering .",
      "British Railways ( BR ) numbers were 32463-32520 , 32556-32566 and 32577-32582 .",

      "In 1909 , four locomotives were rebuilt by D . E . Marsh with larger boilers and designated E4X . These became BR numbers 32466 , 32477 , 32478 and 32489 .",
      "Preservation .",
      "One of the last survivors in 1963 was No . 32473 . This was purchased by a group of preservationists and brought to the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex , where it has remained ever since , except for visits to other lines such as the Severn Valley Railway and Isle of Wight Steam Railway . The engine was withdrawn from traffic in 1971 and dismantled . Work however did not start in earnest until the 1980s and following a long overhaul , she returned to traffic in 1997 to celebrate her centenary in 1998 . After a short period running in the genuine LB&SCR livery it carried after 1912 , with the companys initials painted on the side tanks , these were re-lettered with its earlier LB&SCR name of Birch Grove . In 2005 she was repainted into British Railways lined black mixed traffic livery . Following withdrawal from service in May 2008 , the locomotive was soon brought into the Bluebell workshops for a fast track overhaul , including a repaint into 1920s Southern Railway green to match much of the lines coaching stock . This was completed during January 2010 , with the engine relaunched into traffic on 30 January 2010 . 32473 is the only ex LB&SCR preserved locomotive not to be designed by William Stroudley .",

      "Joseph Moisevich Chaikov ( , also spelled , among other spellings , Tshaykov , Tchaikov , and Tchaikovsky ; 1888 \u2013 1979 ) was a Russian Imperial and Soviet Russian sculptor , graphic designer and teacher of Ukrainian Jewish descent .",
      "Biography .",
      "Born in Kiev ( present-day Kyiv , Ukraine ) and initially trained as an engraver , Chaikov studied in Paris in the years 1910 through 1914 . In 1912 he co-founded a group of young Jewish artists called Mahmad , and published a Hebrew-language magazine with that name ; in 1913 he participated in the Salon dAutomne .",
      "He returned to Kiev in 1914 . He was co-founder , along with El Lissitzky , Boris Aronson and others , of the Jewish socialist Kultur Lige in Kiev , led sculpture classes there , supervised a childrens art studio and illustrated childrens books , and in post-revolutionary Kiev focused on billboards and agitational propaganda . In 1921 he published the Yiddish-language book Skulptur , advocating avant-garde sculpture as a contribution to a new Jewish art . This book was also the first book on sculpture to be published in Yiddish .",
      "Chaikov moved to Moscow to teach at Vkhutemas from 1923 to 1930 , alongside fellow sculptors Boris Korolev and Vera Mukhina . All three designed and taught cubist sculpture in the distinctively Russian Cubo-Futurism style , radically geometric and highly dynamic . From 1929 Chaikov was the head of the Society of Russian Sculptors . In 1932 , after the end of the period of artistic freedom , all of these cubists turned back to Socialist Realism and produced more classically styled work .",
      "In the 1930s his work was prominently shown at the two Soviet worlds fair pavilions , for the 1937 Paris Exposition and the 1939 New York Worlds Fair . His work in Paris was an extensive frieze of nine-foot figures , the People of the USSR , carved on two steles flanking the entrance to the pavilion . Fragments of the Paris work were unearthed in rural France in the 2000s , after having been presented to the French labor union after the fair , relocated to a holiday ch\u00e2teau , broken up by pro-Nazi youth during the occupation , and buried for 50 years .",
      "Chaikov continued to work in a variety of genres , techniques and scales . He was named an Honored Artist of the USSR in 1959 , and his work is in the permanent collection of MOMA .",

      "SECR N class",
      "The SECR N class was a type of 2-6-0 ( mogul ) steam locomotive designed in 1914 by Richard Maunsell for mixed-traffic duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway ( SECR ) . Built between 1917 and 1934 , it was the first non-Great Western Railway ( GWR ) type to use and improve upon the basic design principles established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer ( CME ) George Jackson Churchward . The N class was based on the GWR 4300 Class design , improved with Midland Railway concepts .",
      "The N class was mechanically similar to the SECR K class 2-6-4 passenger tank engine , also by Maunsell . It influenced future 2-6-0 development in Britain and provided the basis for the 3 cylinder N1 class of 1922 . Production was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , and the first N class rolled out of Ashford Works in 1917 , three years after design work was completed . The class replaced obsolete 0-6-0s as part of the SECRs fleet standardisation , as they used parts interchangeable with those of other classes .",
      "Eighty N class locomotives were built in three batches between the First and Second World Wars . Fifty were assembled from kits of parts made at the Royal Arsenal , Woolwich , giving rise to the nickname of Woolworths . They worked over most of the Southern Railway ( SR ) network , and were used by the Southern Region of British Railways ( BR ) until the last was withdrawn in 1966 . One N class locomotive is preserved on the Swanage Railway in Dorset , undergoing overhaul .",
      "Background .",
      "Three factors dictated the type of locomotive that could run on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway ( SECR ) : increased freight and passenger train loadings , poor track quality , and weak , lightly built bridges . An increasing number of passengers used the SECR to reach the cross-Channel ferries at Dover and Folkestone between 1910 and 1913 , and heavy goods trains between Tonbridge and Hither Green marshalling yard stretched the capabilities of existing locomotives and infrastructure . On the lines of the former London , Chatham and Dover Railway ( LCDR ) , flint beach pebbles on a bed of ash had been used for ballast . Conventional track ballast has irregular shapes that lock together to keep the track in place , whereas the smooth pebbles used by the LCDR failed to prevent track movement under strain . The economies in construction meant that only locomotives with low axle loadings could run safely on the track . These restrictions meant that the SECR was unable to follow a coherent locomotive strategy that reduced costs and increased serviceability . The railways Operating Department had to use mismatched classes of underpowered and obsolete 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 locomotives because they could run within the restrictions imposed by the infrastructure . This meant frequent double-heading that increased operational costs .",
      "Richard Maunsell was appointed CME of the SECR in 1913 , following the retirement of Harry Wainwright due to ill health . Wainwright left a legacy of competent but unspectacular locomotives that struggled to cope with the increased train lengths and loadings . Maunsell took control of the short-term situation by improving existing designs , and he introduced new engines to progressively replace obsolete classes . New designs could also cut costs on the SECR , as one capable mixed-traffic locomotive could undertake the work of two separate passenger or freight types . The first new design was to become Maunsells N class 2-6-0 .",
      "Design and construction .",
      "The N class was designed by Maunsell in 1914 to provide a sturdy mixed-traffic locomotive with high route availability . Intended to replace several obsolete 0-6-0 types , the N class was the first step in the SECRs fleet standardisation programme , which also included the K class 2-6-4T passenger tank locomotive . Maunsell enlisted the help of former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft , who suggested that a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement would allow the class to run on the poor-quality track in north Kent . This arrangement allowed for a longer wheelbase with leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on tight track curves , which had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR . A longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than an 0-6-0 , giving the N class sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains .",
      "The N class incorporated the principles of power and reliability established by George Churchward , using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version , a regulator located in the smokebox , long-travel valves for free running up to , a sharply tapered and domeless boiler , and a right-hand driving position . These features are attributed to Holcroft , who worked on the GWR 4300 class before joining the SECR . The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use on future SECR locomotive designs , thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works . The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsells proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the N class , the K class , and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis . The need to reduce overall weight also meant that the latter would feature lightly braced frames .",
      "Maunsells Chief Locomotive Draughtsman , James Clayton , brought functional Midland Railway influences to the design , such as the shape of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox , which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler . Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs . Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary , and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods . Innovations added by Maunsells team included steam-powered locomotive brakes , locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side , and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam . Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events , which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs . All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs .",
      "SECR batch .",
      "Production of the first batch was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War . Assembly began towards the end of the war and the first locomotive , No . 810 , emerged from Ashford Works for proving trials in July 1917 , one month after the first K class tank , whose design was derived from the N class . Entering service in August 1917 , No . 810 was trialled for three years before another 15 locomotives ( Nos . 811\u2013825 ) were ordered in 1919 . These were built between 1920 and 1923 ; their construction delayed by a backlog of repairs caused by the war . The first left Ashford Works in June 1920 , featuring a greater superheating surface area within the boiler as a result of operational experience with No . 810 . All locomotives were equipped with tenders .",
      "In 1922 modifications were made to No . 822 during assembly . This was because production delays at Ashford prevented the building of a proposed 3-cylinder design drawn-up in 1919 . Maunsell and Holcroft revised No . 822s cylinder arrangement to accommodate a third inside cylinder fitted between the frames . The outside cylinders were also reduced to diameter to accommodate the inside cylinder and its associated valve linkages . The differences between No . 822 and the rest of the N class meant that this locomotive was re-designated as the 1919 proposal , becoming the prototype of the SR N1 class when completed in March 1923 .",
      "Woolwich batch .",
      "The first batch of the N class proved successful in service , and few problems were encountered after settling-in . The Ministry of Supply drew up a contract for a second batch to the same specification \u2013 to be built at the Royal Arsenal , Woolwich . The government backing came as part of a proposal to nationalise the railways , which would require a standard fleet of locomotives to promote economies in production and maintenance . The nationalisation proposal was abandoned ; instead , the government passed the 1921 Railways Act , which grouped the railways into the Big Four in 1923 . Building of the second batch went ahead to retain skilled labour at Woolwich , but the fabrication of 119 boilers for allocation to the kits of parts was contracted-out because of limited production capacity at Woolwich and Ashford ; the North British Locomotive Company built 85 , Robert Stephenson and Company 20 , and Kitson & Co . 14 . By 1924 , the prefabricated components stored at Woolwich formed 100 complete N class kits for purchase from the government .",
      "The newly created Southern Railway , which had absorbed the SECR in the 1923 Grouping , undertook trials in early 1924 to compare the performance of its freight locomotives . Because the Ns were designed to haul both freight and passenger traffic , Maunsell , as the newly appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Railway , decided to compare the design with the N1 , LSWR S15 and LB&SCR K classes in trials that involved hauling trains of 65 loaded wagons . Although the S15 was superior in freight haulage capacity and operational economy , the N class\u2019 good all-round performance on passenger and freight meant that the type was adopted as the companys standard mixed-traffic design . The Southern Railway subsequently bought fifty Woolwich kits for assembly at Ashford between June 1924 and August 1925 . These were identical to the SECR batch and were given numbers in the series A826\u2013A875 . The Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland bought 12 kits prior to its amalgamation into the Great Southern Railways , which bought an extra 15 . The latter 15 locomotives were divided into eight GSR Class 372 with driving wheels and six GSR Class 393 with driving wheels : the final kit was kept for spares .",
      "The Metropolitan Railway bought six kits for conversion to the Metropolitan Railway K Class 2-6-4T tank engines , which were similar in outline to the SECR K class . The remaining 17 complete kits at Woolwich were bought by the Southern Railway , and formed the basis of later locomotive classes such as the three-cylinder SR W class 2-6-4 tank locomotive . The prototype W class was produced in 1932 from N class parts with the addition of water tanks , a coal bunker , a rear bogie and a third cylinder between the frames . Woolwich also stocked a surplus of N class bogie components , and these were bought by the Southern for rebuilding the LB&SCR E1 class 0-6-0 tanks into the E1R class 0-6-2 tanks .",
      "Southern Railway batch .",
      "In 1932 , the Southern Railway ordered a final batch of 15 locomotives ( Nos . 1400\u20131414 ) to expand class availability on the Southern Railways network . These were built at Ashford works and differed from the previous 65 in a number of ways . The cabs of the final eight locomotives ( Nos . 1407\u20131414 ) were fitted for left-hand driving , which was adopted as standard by the Southern Railway . The original N class chimney was replaced with the lower-profile version used on the U1 class , which increased route availability by allowing the locomotives to pass under lower bridges and tunnels . Maunsell had begun to research smoke deflection techniques to improve driver visibility on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927 , which resulted in the adoption of a standard smoke deflector design for the Southern Railway . A smaller version was fitted to Nos . 1400\u20131414 during building .",
      "Before entering service , the batch was attached to tenders to increase operational range over the Southern Railways long Western section routes . Despite this advantage , tenders fitted to the eight left-hand drive examples were intended for use with right-hand drive locomotives . This resulted in the location of the firemans fittings on the wrong side of the cab . The design also necessitated the addition of a step to the footplate , as the boiler backhead was lower than the fall-plate that connected the tender and cab floors . The new batch incorporated a new set of footsteps beneath the front buffer beam , modified slide-bars and the dome was redesigned to incorporate the regulator to ease access during routine maintenance .",
      "Operational details .",
      "The N class was used to haul services over most of the SECR network and became a familiar sight on the difficult cross-country route between and , on which the steep gradients had taxed the companys 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 designs . The success of the 2-6-0 in traversing this route was due to their higher-capacity tapered boilers that produced an ample supply of steam , and the small 5 ft 6 in ( 1.68 m ) driving wheels that delivered considerable tractive effort when climbing gradients such as the 1 in 100 between and .",
      "After The Grouping in 1923 , the N class remained on the former SECR network , which was incorporated into the Southern Railways Eastern section . Typical services included , Ashford and freights , and Cannon Street to Dover passenger trains . In early 1924 Nos . A815 and A825 were transferred to the former LSWR mainline between Waterloo and Guildford for trials . These proved successful , and paved the way for the allocation of most of the Woolwich batch to the Southern Railways Western section . The type regularly replaced Dugald Drummonds ageing LSWR T9 class 4-4-0s on portions of the Atlantic Coast Express over the steeply graded mainlines west of Exeter .",
      "The N class was also successful on the Central section , where they worked alongside L . B . Billintons LB&SCR K class 2-6-0s . However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the N class prevented use of the type on the Eastern sections Tonbridge\u2013Hastings line . The routes narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate the class , and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route . Despite these restrictions , the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds , a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War . The entire class came into British Railways ownership in 1948 and could be seen in most areas of the Southern Region .",
      "Performance of the class and modifications .",
      "When introduced in 1917 , the N class proved adept at hauling both passenger and freight services on the SECR . They were well liked by crews who appreciated the general robustness of the design , although the lightly built frames caused excessive vibration and rough riding on the footplate when worked hard . Despite there being little wrong with the original design , the N class\u2019 full steaming potential was not realised because of the failure to capitalise upon a larger boiler , which was a direct consequence of Maunsells standardisation policy . Instead , the SECR batch was trial-fitted with stovepipe chimneys in an attempt to improve draughting . This was initially applied to No . 812 in 1921 , although two more were fitted to Nos . 817 and 819 during building because of a shortage of chimneys at Ashford Works . The chimney fitted to No . 819 was transferred to No . 818 sometime between 1921 and 1924 , though all stovepipes had been replaced with the standard N class type by April 1927 . Another trial saw the addition of a second slidebar to No . 825 , which gave better support to the valve gear and helped protect it from spillage from the driving wheel sander fillers .",
      "The quality of the original design was such that No . A866 was put on display at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley from May to November 1925 , and no class-wide modifications were made until 1934 . This was when the SECR and Woolwich batches began to receive new domes and front footsteps during overhauls and general repairs . These were the same design as those used on Nos . 1400\u20131414 , and were intended to standardise components between the batches . The SECR and Woolwich batches also received smoke deflectors to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring the drivers vision ahead . The U1 chimneys replaced the standard N class type on the earlier locomotives , which , along with the removal of the piston tail rods on the earlier batches , created a truly standardised appearance .",
      "In 1937 , Maunsells replacement Oliver Bulleid saw no need to improve draughting of the class , and spared them from trials with Lema\u00eetre multiple-jet blastpipes and wide-diameter chimneys . However , he had Maunsells smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum snifting valves removed at the end of the Second World War in an effort to reduce maintenance . Bulleid also had eight new tenders built specially for the left-hand drive locomotives . In 1947 , No . 1831 was given electric lighting and converted to oil-burning as part of government-backed fuel trials in anticipation of a post-war coal shortage , though it was reverted to coal-firing in December 1948 .",
      "The class was heavily used by British Railways : 29 locomotives required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear . Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use , and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted : the inside steam pipes of Maunsells original design were replaced by outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox , behind the smoke deflectors . From 1957 , some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class 4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal , though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class . Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption . The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System ( AWS ) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively .",
      "Experiments .",
      "Although sufficient for the Southern Railways needs , the N class was an ideal test-bed for experiments with new steam technology . The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington feed pump to No . A819 in 1924 . The trial was moderately successful , and the pump remained in use until removal in 1927 . In June 1930 , No . A816 was withdrawn from service for the application of experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works . This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman , Mr . A.P.H . Anderson , who proposed the use of a fan system to condense spent steam and improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water .",
      "No . A816 emerged from Eastleigh in August 1931 for trials , but was stopped when temperature variations within the condensing equipment caused water leakage . Modifications were made to improve the draughting of the locomotive , incorporating a box-like chimney attached to the condenser array by pipes . No . A816 was released for more trials , and produced performances well-below those displayed by the unmodified members of the class . The experiment was ended when the systems developers ran out of money , and the locomotive was converted back to standard form between May and August 1935 , re-entering service as No . 1816 .",
      "The final experiment with performance enhancement began in October 1933 , when No . 1850 had its Walschaerts valve gear replaced with J.T . Marshall valve gear at Eastleigh Works . The engine was trialled on the Western section , where the gear showed promise at slower speeds , with reduced consumption of coal and water . Problems were encountered at speeds over , at which a severe knocking sound was reported by the footplate crew . When trialled on a Basingstoke\u2013Waterloo semi-fast ( a high-speed passenger train that stops at selected intermediate stations ) , the valve gear disintegrated near . After immediate withdrawal from traffic , the locomotive had its Walschaerts valve gear re-fitted and No . 1850 re-entered traffic in April 1934 .",
      "Withdrawal .",
      "Suitable work for the class began to decline after completion of the Kent Coast route electrification in 1959 . The reduction of work precipitated a phased reduction of the class that began with the withdrawal of No . 31409 in November 1962 . The withdrawal programme intensified after boundary changes on the Southern Region placed the lines west of Salisbury under Western Region control in 1963 . Class members based at Exmouth Junction shed were withdrawn in 1964 , whilst the Southern Regions allocation was gradually replaced by Bulleids Light Pacifics . The last operational members of the class were Nos . 31405 and 31408 ; both were withdrawn in June 1966 .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "- On 4 April 1958 , locomotive No . 31867 was hauling a parcels train that overran signals and collided with an electric multiple unit at Gloucester Road Junction , Croydon , Surrey . Nine people were injured .",
      "Livery and numbering .",
      "SECR and Southern Railway .",
      "N class locomotives were initially painted in an unlined dark grey livery with white lettering and numbering . This Maunsell grey livery was introduced by the SECR as a wartime economy measure . After Grouping in 1923 , the Southern Railway replaced the different liveries of the constituent companies with a standard sage green livery ( the colour was that previously used by Robert Urie on the LSWR ) with black and white lining , primrose yellow numbering and Southern on the tender . This livery was first applied to No . 825 .",
      "From 1925 , the class was repainted in a darker olive green livery , introduced by Maunsell , with plain white lining , black borders and primrose yellow markings . In 1939 , shortly after the start of the Second World War , locomotives Nos . 1413 and 1850 were painted in unlined olive green because of labour shortages . In 1941 , Nos . 1821 , 1825 , 1847 , 1878 and 1403 were run in unlined olive green with Bulleids gilt block lettering . Labour and paint shortages during the Second World War meant that all N class locomotives were painted in plain black by 1945 . In 1946 , two locomotives , Nos . 1817 and 1854 , were repainted in Bulleids malachite green livery , with yellow and black lining and Sunshine yellow lettering .",
      "The 15 locomotives built by Ashford Works for the SECR between August 1917 and December 1923 were numbered 810\u2013824 . The Royal Arsenal batch of 50 locomotives purchased by the newly formed Southern Railway from 1923 were numbered A825\u2013A875 ; the numbers followed consecutively from the Ashford batch but with a prefix A to denote a locomotive allocated for overhaul at Ashford Works . The prefix was gradually applied to the SECR batch . From 1928 , a new system was adopted where all Southern Railway locomotives were renumbered into one sequence . The SECR and Woolwich N class batches became Nos . 1810\u20131875 . The final batch of 15 locomotives , built between 1932 and 1934 , were numbered 1400\u20131414 from new .",
      "British Railways .",
      "The class was absorbed by British Railways in 1948 , and initially given the power classification 4MT in 1949 . Under British Railways ownership , the class was reclassified from 4MT to 4P5FB in 1953 ; the B denoting the brake power rating when used on unfitted ( non-vacuum braked ) goods trains . The locomotives at first retained their Southern Railway livery , but with British Railways painted on the tender in Bulleid block lettering . Eight locomotives had light repairs prior to 1950 and were given an S prefix to the Southern number ( e.g . s1405 ) . From 1949 to 1950 N class locomotives were repainted in the British Railways mixed-traffic lined black livery with red , cream and grey lining and the British Railways crest on the tender . Numbering was changed to the British Railways standard numbering system : the series 31810\u201331875 was allocated to the earlier locomotives , and 31400\u201331414 to the final 15 .",
      "Operational assessment and preservation .",
      "The N class was the first to combine Churchward design principles with the best practices of other railways ; it was an important step in the development of the British 2-6-0 , providing inspiration for the LMS Hughes Crab of 1926 and subsequent Maunsell designs . The locomotives were well received by crews , who nicknamed them Woolworths , because the majority were fabricated from inexpensively produced parts from Woolwich . The robustness and reliability of the design ensured that their sphere of operation was expanded to cover most of the Southern Railway network . The utility of the N class as capable mixed-traffic locomotives ensured their continued use until withdrawal in 1966 .",
      "One member of the class is preserved , No . ( 3 ) 1874 , which was rescued in March 1974 from the Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry , Vale of Glamorgan , South Wales . One of the Woolwich batch , this locomotive was bought and restored for use on the Mid-Hants Railway ; it was steamed for the first time in preservation in 1977 , and was operational at the railways re-opening as a heritage attraction in April 1977 . The locomotive received two names during the late 1970s , the first one was Aznar Line , which was the shipping company that helped move the locomotives out of the scrapyard , and the second one was Brian Fisk who helped out with the locomotives restoration . The locomotive was withdrawn in 1998 due to problems that require firebox reconstruction . In 2012 , the locomotive was repainted into its SR Wartime Black guise of 1874 for the first time in decades . The locomotive was moved from the Mid-Hants Railway to the Swanage Railway in 2014 along with U Classes 31806 and 31625 . In August 2014 , the overhaul to return 31874 to operational condition began .",

      "Paul Whitehead Sturrock ( born 10 October 1956 ) is a Scottish football player and coach .",
      "As a player , Sturrock spent his entire senior career with Dundee United , making more than five hundred appearances between 1974 and 1989 . He won the Scottish Football League title with United in 1982\u201383 and the Scottish League Cup twice , in 1979 and 1980 . He was named the SFWA Footballer of the Year in 1982 . At international level , Sturrock played twenty times for Scotland and appeared at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups .",
      "Sturrocks managerial career began with St Johnstone in 1993 , where he went on to win the Scottish First Division title in 1996\u201397 before returning to Dundee United as manager . Since 2000 , Sturrock has worked as a manager in English football , initially with Plymouth Argyle where he helped the club to win two promotions before moving on to a brief spell with Southampton . He has subsequently also managed Sheffield Wednesday , Swindon Town and Southend United as well as returning to Plymouth for a second spell . He became Yeovil Town manager in April 2015 , but left the club eight months later . According to an analysis by the Financial Times he was among the countrys best ever managers , even though he has mostly managed clubs at Championship level and below .",
      "He is known by fans as Luggy ( from the Scots language word lugs , Eng : ears ) . Sturrock announced in July 2008 that he was suffering from a mild form of Parkinsons disease . His son , Blair , was also a professional footballer .",
      "Early life .",
      "Sturrock was born in Ellon , Aberdeenshire , and grew up in Pitlochry , Perthshire , where he was educated at the local primary and secondary schools and played for amateur side Grandtully Vale . In 1972 , he joined Vale of Atholl of the Perthshire Amateur First Division ( where he returned as coach in his latter days with Dundee United ) , and in the 1972\u201373 season he scored approximately 100 goals . He then moved on to Bankfoot Athletic , and in the 1973\u201374 season he scored 53 goals as they finished 2nd in the Scottish Junior FA First Division . He had trials with Morton and St Johnstone , but was signed for Dundee United by then manager Jim McLean on 1 July 1974 .",
      "Playing career .",
      "Club .",
      "Sturrock made his debut in the European Cup Winners Cup match v Juil Petrosani of Romania on 18 September 1974 and his league debut on 28 December 1974 as a substitute against Motherwell .",
      "In his first season at Tannadice he made nine League appearances and came on from the substitutes bench for three more and in the process he scored six goals . His first goal for Dundee United was one of two he scored in a 2\u20132 draw with Rangers at Tannadice on 5 April 1975 . Dundee United finished fourth in the League that year . In the following season , he made 18 League appearances , eight as sub , and scored three times . He was also played as a substitute in two of the three Scottish Cup ties and was on from the start in five out of six League Cup games and scored once . He also started in three of the four UEFA Cup games netting one in that competition , too .",
      "1976\u201377 not only saw Dundee United consolidate their Premier League position but throughout the campaign Sturrock was an ever-present , playing in all 36 League games and scoring 15 times . Adding that total to one each in the Scottish Cup and League Cup he was top scorer at the Club that year . He played in Uniteds only Scottish Cup tie , a 4\u20131 defeat at St Mirren . He also appeared four times plus once as sub out of the six League Cup ties . In a short-lived Anglo Scottish Cup campaign he was brought on as sub in one leg of the tie against Aberdeen .",
      "In 1982\u201383 , Dundee United won the Scottish League Championship , losing only four League games during the season . Sturrock contributed to this success with eight goals in his 28 appearances . He also set up Ralph Milne for his fourth-minute opener against Dundee in the final League game . The Scottish Cup that year had been yet another early exit at the hands of St Mirren . Sturrock scored seven in the nine games he turned out in on the way to a League Cup quarter-final exit . He also played in seven of the eight games and scored once in a UEFA Cup run that ended with an exit in Prague .",
      "His playing career ended in 1989 . His final goal for United came on 8 April 1989 in a 2\u20131 victory over local rivals Dundee . In 385 league appearances from 1974 to 1989 he scored 109 goals for the club . His final tally of 171 goals in 576 games in all competitions makes him the second highest goalscorer in Dundee Uniteds history . Sturrock stayed at Tannadice for the next five years , in the role of coach . He left the club in 1993 after twenty years continuous service .",
      "International .",
      "Sturrock made his first appearance for the Scotland under-21 team on 12 October 1976 , in a goalless draw with Czechoslovakia . Four months later , he scored in a 3\u20132 win against Wales under-21s on 9 February 1977 .",
      "Sturrock made his full international debut for Scotland against Wales on 16 May 1981 , and on 8 November 1981 , he scored his first goal for Scotland in the 2\u20131 World Cup qualifier defeat against Portugal in Lisbon . Sturrock won 20 caps for his country , scoring three goals . He was a non-playing member of the Scotland squad for the 1982 World Cup finals in Spain and appeared twice in Mexico in 1986 .",
      "Management career .",
      "In a 2012 study by Stefan Szymanski , economics professor at the University of Michigan , Sturrock was rated as one of the best managers in English football .",
      "St Johnstone .",
      "In 1993 , Sturrock became the manager of First Division team St Johnstone , having been recommended by the outgoing manager , John McClelland . Despite some early poor form \u2013 which included a 4\u20130 Scottish Cup humbling at the hands of Stenhousemuir \u2013 Sturrock eventually guided the team to a comfortable promotion in 1996\u201397 .",
      "Dundee United .",
      "In September 1998 Sturrock was appointed manager at Dundee United . He made a bright start to his time as manager at Tannadice , where he was feted by the fans for his excellent spell as a player . His United team failed to recover from the sale of top scorer Billy Dodds in December 1999 , when they were lying third in the table . The team scored few goals following Doddss departure , and Sturrock resigned after two games of the 2000\u201301 season .",
      "Plymouth Argyle .",
      "In October 2000 Sturrock joined Plymouth Argyle , a club which had reached the lowest ebb in its history , struggling in the English Football League Third Division . A shake-up at boardroom level took place , Sturrock began to build his own squad . The following season , he guided them to the Third Division title breaking numerous records in the process , including a club and league points total of 102 . In October 2003 , Sturrock had successfully taken Argyle back to the top of the Football League Second Division and left when Plymouth had just 12 games to play in what would prove to be another season when they would finish as divisional champions and return to the Football League Championship , formerly known as the First Division . As a result of his success at Home Park he was named as the manager of Argyles Team of the Century in a BBC Devon poll .",
      "Southampton .",
      "Sturrock was named as the successor to Gordon Strachan as manager of Southampton on 4 March 2004 . On 23 August 2004 it was announced that Sturrock was leaving the club by mutual consent , after a disappointing run of form and rumours of player unrest and boardroom dissatisfaction with his management .",
      "Sheffield Wednesday .",
      "He was then appointed by League One club Sheffield Wednesday languishing in 14th place on 23 September 2004 , and he guided the club to the League One play-offs . After beating Brentford in the semi-final with an aggregate score of 3\u20131 , Sturrock took Wednesday to the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium and beat Hartlepool United 4\u20132 after extra-time , winning promotion to the Championship . Despite numerous injuries to key players he helped Wednesday to finish 10 points clear of relegation in their first season back in The Championship .",
      "A slow start to the 2006\u201307 season sparked rumours that Wednesday were about to sack Sturrock , but this speculation looked to be false when he agreed a new four-year contract on 14 September . But he was sacked on the evening of 19 October , just five weeks and three games after agreeing this new deal . The new contract was agreed while the club were at the bottom of the League , while he was sacked when they were fourth from bottom .",
      "Swindon Town .",
      "In late October 2006 , Swindon Town allowed their management team of Dennis Wise and Gustavo Poyet to join Leeds United . Swindon pounced at the opportunity to acquire the services of Sturrock and on 7 November 2006 Sturrock was confirmed as manager with Kevin Summerfield and John Blackley following him from Wednesday . Sturrocks first season in charge at Swindon was a success , achieving promotion from League Two to League One .",
      "Swindon made a decent start to the 2007\u201308 season , maintaining their position in the top half of the league table after the first 8 games .",
      "Return to Plymouth .",
      "On 27 November 2007 , Sturrock resigned his post as Swindon Town manager after just over a year with the club to rejoin previous club Plymouth Argyle . Sturrock also brought back to the club assistants Kevin Summerfield and John Blackley , who were previously with him during his first successful spell as manager . Sturrock then proceeded to take the club to its highest league position in 20 years : tenth in the Championship . However , the team subsequently struggled and finished five points and one place outside the Championship relegation zone in the 2008\u201309 season . On 10 December 2009 , Sturrock was removed as Plymouth Argyle manager and put into a business support role by chairman Sir Roy Gardner . On 22 April 2010 the Plymouth board confirmed that Paul Sturrock had left his role within the club to pursue other managerial opportunities . Following Sturrocks departure , it emerged that the board had mis-managed the finances of the club and Argyle entered administration .",
      "Southend United .",
      "On 5 July 2010 he was confirmed as manager of League Two Southend United . Former Salisbury City manager Tommy Widdrington was named as Sturrocks assistant manager while one of Sturrocks former players at Plymouth Argyle and Sheffield Wednesday , who served as captain at the latter , Graham Coughlan was soon appointed as a player-coach .",
      "Sturrock faced the tough task of rebuilding the Southend side with only five first team players available for selection at one stage of pre-season , with only Anthony Grant , Matt Paterson and Scott Spencer surviving . Sturrock soon appointed new signing Craig Easton , who he had previously managed at Swindon Town , as captain while another player from one of Sturrocks old clubs , Chris Barker , was later appointed as vice-captain , having initially been signed on loan , and then permanently on deadline day . It was not an easy task for Sturrock as his assistant , Tommy Widdrington left for footballing reasons on Wednesday 15 December 2010 . After a mid table finish in his first season , he enjoyed more success during the 2011\u201312 season where Southend led League Two for most of the campaign . Sturrock was named Manager of the Month for September 2011 by the Football League .",
      "Sturrock was sacked as manager of Southend United on 24 March 2013 although it was agreed that he could lead out the players in the final of the Football League Trophy to be held at Wembley on 7 April . Sturrock declined the offer .",
      "Yeovil Town .",
      "After a brief spell as an advisor to Conference Premier side Torquay United , he departed just four days after taking the job , after being appointed manager of Football League One side Yeovil Town on 9 April 2015 , with the club all but relegated .",
      "Following a poor start to the season , Yeovil announced on 1 December 2015 that they had parted company with Sturrock .",
      "Post-retirement .",
      "Following his retirement from professional management , Sturrock returned to live in the South West of England . He remained involved in local football , being given an advisory role at non-League club Plymouth Parkway . He also writes a regular column for local newspaper , the Plymouth Evening Herald .",
      "On 8 March 2018 , Sturrock renewed his involvement with Dundee United when he was appointed as the clubs chief scout in England . Later in March , Sturrock was added to the United coaching staff . He left United during the 2018\u201319 season .",

Sam Huis first Cantonese hit , Eiffel Tower Above the Clouds ( ) -- originally titled Here and Now ( ) -- was first played on the Hui Brothers Show in April 1972 .",
      "Hui signed a contract with Polydor and produced his first single in English , April Lady .",
      "Huis first Cantonese album , Games Gamblers Play ( ) , was the partial soundtrack to the Michael Hui-directed film of the same name . This album became popular , selling 200,000 copies , and was one of the major musical works that helped to start the popularity of Cantopop .",
      "Huis music gained popular appeal , particularly with the working class , for its simplicity and the relevance of the lyrics . A prolific songwriter , a noted recurring theme in his music is that it often describes or humorously satirises Hong Kong society and events .",
      "In 1976 , Huis singing and acting career took off after the release of the breakout album The Private Eyes , the soundtrack to the 1976 film The Private Eyes .",
      "In the album The Private Eyes , it humorously reflected on the harsh realities of middle and lower-income Hong Kongers . Others such as Song of Water Use ( ) , which referenced the days of water rationing during the 1960s , and Could Not Care Less About 1997 ( \u8a71\u77e5\u4f6097 ) , which encouraged Hong Kong people to adopt a carpe diem attitude instead of worrying about the imminent handover to the Peoples Republic of China on 1 July 1997 , were more topical in nature and referenced local events . While some of his songs are lighthearted , others carried philosophical messages brought out through artful use of Chinese words that have multiple symbolism . Examples can be seen in his farewell song in 1992 and From the Heart of a Loafer ( ) , where for Cantopop , the sophisticated language and messages were rare in the lyrics of contemporary artists .",
      "On June 17 , 1979 , Hui became the first singer from Hong Kong to perform at the Tokyo Music Festival .",
      "Film .",
      "Hui signed a contract with Golden Harvest in 1971 . On a personal note , Hui is closer to his middle brother Ricky ( deceased 8 November 2011 ) than to their oldest brother Michael . Sam and Michael reportedly fell out with each other after their pre-1985 successes . However , in Michaels Chicken and Duck Talk ( 1988 ) , Hui appeared in a short 1-minute cameo , playing the role of himself as master of ceremonies at the grand opening of Dannys Chicken , and contributed to its theme song for its end credits entitled You Have Your Say ( ) . Then in 1990 , the three brothers reunited in Front Page , a lampoon on Hong Kongs sometimes over-zealous entertainment news industry . Hui also collaborated with several popular singers such as Leslie Cheung both musically and on-screen culminating in the hit single written by Hui and composed by Cheung entitled Silence is Golden ( ) , which Cheung also sung as a solo track on his 1987 album , Hot Summer , as well as the catchy tune , Ive Never Been Afraid ( ) in 1989 as the end theme for .",
      "Hui also starred in the Aces Go Places , a series of Hong Kong action\u2013comedies in the 1980s , with Karl Maka .",
      "He was once seriously injured while filming The Legend of Wisely in Tibet due to lack of oxygen , thereafter falling very ill and many of his fans pointed out that this near fatal accident may have been pivotal on his decision to retire as they superstitiously believed that he was haunted by a spirit .",
      "Retirement .",
      "During the late 1980s , Huis father advised him to retire to avoid the stresses he endured from hosting concerts . Huis lack of oxygen suffered on a previous film , was actually carbon monoxide poisoning . His mother purportedly also had reservations about his performing , including that he might injure himself on stage .",
      "A Hong Kong concert in 1990 supposedly marked his early retirement , however Hui then agreed to host a 42-show concert series . Around the time of the 30th show , Huis father died but despite his grief , he continued to host .",
      "Farewell concerts .",
      "In 1991 to 1992 , Hui held a many farewell concerts . Hui hosted a total of 14 shows in Hong Kong preempting his actual retirement .",
      "Hui is known as the Canto-pop godfather and the Elvis Presley of Hong Kong .",
      "Hui also hosted shows in Canada , in Vancouver , at the Pacific Coliseum , and Toronto , Ontario , which he dedicated to his late father . Despite reiterating his plans for retirement , Hui came back for a short stint in the movie Winner Takes All co-starring Nicholas Tse and Ruby Lin . This he maintained , was a result of being unable to ignore his hearts desire .",
      "Widely acclaimed as the God of Song in Hong Kong ( the first singer to be so acknowledged ) , he decided to come out of retirement in 2004 and held multiple comeback concerts in which he was welcomed by a Hong Kong public at sell-out shows . In these concerts , he paid tribute to his recent passed close colleagues , Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui in 2003 and claimed that their deaths had influenced his decision to return to performing , culminating in his 2004 comeback song 04 Bless You ( 04 \u795d\u798f\u4f60 ) . Hui performed in a concert in Kuala Lumpur on 19 and 20 February 2005 with his brother , Ricky Hui , and sons but has not made active plans for any follow-ups . He also performed in Vancouver on 15 December 2005 and in Singapore on 29 March 2008 .",
      "In 2007 , Hui signed with EC Music and released his first album in 17 years , named Life is Good ( ) .",
      "Personal life .",
      "In December 1971 , Hui married Rebecca Rebu Fleming , a Filipino-American . They have two sons , Ryan Hui and Scott Hui . Hui and his family live in Hong Kong . Ryan Hui is a singer-songwriter and has released several albums , and Scott Hui is a film director .",

      "Georges Duby",
      "Georges Duby ( 7 October 1919 \u2013 3 December 1996 ) was a French historian who specialised in the social and economic history of the Middle Ages . He ranks among the most influential medieval historians of the twentieth century and was one of Frances most prominent public intellectuals from the 1970s to his death .",
      "Born to a family of Proven\u00e7al craftsmen living in Paris , Duby was initially educated in the field of historical geography before he moved into history . He earned an undergraduate degree at Lyon in 1942 and completed his graduate thesis at the Sorbonne under Charles-Edmond Perrin in 1952 . He taught first at Besan\u00e7on and then at the University of Aix-en-Provence before he was appointed in 1970 to the Chair of the History of Medieval Society in the Coll\u00e8ge de France . He remained attached to the Coll\u00e8ge until his retirement in 1991 . He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1987 .",
      "Impact of the M\u00e2connais book .",
      "Although Duby authored dozens of books , articles and reviews during his prolific career\u2014for academic as well as popular audiences\u2014his reputation and legacy as a scholar will always be attached to his first monograph , a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aux XIe et XIIe si\u00e8cles dans la r\u00e9gion m\u00e2connaise ( Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the M\u00e2connais region ) . La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 exerted a profound influence on medieval scholarship in the second half of the twentieth century , placing the study of medieval feudal society on an entirely new footing . Working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian monastery of Cluny , as well as the dioceses of M\u00e2con and Dijon , Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the M\u00e2connais region , charting a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000 .",
      "Duby argued that in early eleventh century , governing institutions\u2014particularly comital courts established under the Carolingian monarchy\u2014that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the ninth and tenth centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence . The emergence of this new , decentralized society of dynastic lords could then explain such later eleventh-century phenomena as the Peace of God , the Gregorian reform movement and the Crusades .",
      "Following upon this , Duby formulated a famous theory about the Crusades : that the tremendous response to the idea of holy war against the Muslims can be traced to the desire of disinherited ( but well-armed ) second and third sons of this French parvenue aristocracy to make their fortunes by venturing abroad and settling in the Levant . While Dubys theory had long-lasting influence , later scholars such as Jonathan Riley-Smith have done much to discredit it , arguing that there was no large-scale shortage of land in Western Europe at the time , that knights actually lost money going on crusade , and that lay religious sentiment was their primary motivation .",
      "Dubys intensive and rigorous examination of a local society based on archival sources and a broad understanding of the social , environmental and economic bases of daily life became a standard model for medieval historical research in France for decades after the appearance of La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 . Throughout the 1970s and 80s , French doctoral students investigated their own corners of medieval France , Italy and Spain in a similar way , hoping to compare and contrast their own results with those of Dubys M\u00e2connais and its thesis about the transformation of European society at the end of the first millennium .",
      "Although he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre that came to be known as the Annales School , Duby was in many ways the most visible exponent of the Annaliste tradition , emphasizing the need to place people and their daily lives at the center of historical inquiry .",
      "Histoire des mentalit\u00e9s .",
      "Duby was also a pioneer in what he and other Annaliste historians in the 1970s and 80s came to call the history of mentalities , or the study of not just what people did , but their value systems and how they imagined their world . In books like The Three Orders : Feudal Society Imagined and The Age of Cathedrals , Duby showed how ideals and social reality existed in dynamic relationship to one another . His distilled biographical essay on William Marshal set the knights career in the context of feudal loyalties , honour and the chivalric frame of mind .",
      "Dubys interest in the idea of historical mentalities extended to thinking about the position of contemporary society vis-a-vis its past . In Le Dimanche de Bouvines ( 1973 ) on the pivotal 1214 battle of Bouvines , Duby chose not to analyze the battle itself , but the ways it had been represented and remembered over time and the role its memory had played in the formation of French ideas about its medieval past . The book remains a classic of Annales-style historiography , eschewing the great man and event-oriented theories of political history in favor of asking questions about the evolution of historical perceptions and ideas over the long term , the longue dur\u00e9e . Duby also wrote frequently in newspapers and popular journals and was a regular guest on radio and television programs promoting historical awareness and support for the arts and social sciences in France . He served as the first director of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9dition de programmes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision ( aka La Sept ) , a French broadcast network dedicated to educational programming .",
      "His last book , Lhistoire continue ( History Continues ) ( 1991 ; Engl . trans . 1994 ) , is an intellectual autobiography . In it , Duby stresses the importance of the historian as a public figure who can make the past relevant and exciting to those in the present .",

      "Clubul Sportiv Aerostar Bac\u0103u , commonly known as Aerostar Bac\u0103u or simply as Aerostar , is a Romanian professional football club from the city of Bac\u0103u , Bac\u0103u County , currently playing in the Liga II .",
      "Founded in 1977 as Aripile Bac\u0103u , the yellow and blues are known as the team of the citys aeronautical manufacturing company . After the fall of communism , the country has undergone a series administrative changes , and in the early 1990s the company changed its name to Aerostar , a name which was also adopted by the football club . During the 1993\u201394 season , the club encountered serious financial problems that led to the exclusion from the Divizia C championship and bankruptcy . In the summer of 1995 , the side was refounded with the same name of Aerostar Bac\u0103u and enrolled in the fourth division .",
      "History .",
      "Aripile , first years and the ascension ( 1977\u20131992 ) .",
      "Founded in 1977 as Aripile Bac\u0103u ( The Bac\u0103u Wings ) the club was enrolled directly in the Divizia C , being assigned to the second series . The team obtained only a 14th place out of 16 in the first season and a 15th place at the end of the second , being relegated to the fourth tier of the Romanian football league system . After one season of absence Aripile promoted back to Divizia C and changed its name in Victoria IRA Bac\u0103u .",
      "As Victoria IRA , the results started to appear : 1980\u201381 \u2013 6th and 1981\u201382 \u2013 5th . In the summer of 1982 the club ownership decided to change the teams name back to the old one , Aripile Bac\u0103u . A fantastic season followed , in which Aripile fought for promotion until the last rounds , finishing 2nd , at 5 points behind the local rival , Partizanul Bac\u0103u and two points over another team from Bac\u0103u County , Petrolul Moine\u0219ti . In the next season the Airmen were even closer to the goal of promotion , being separated from the leader , Fepa 74 B\u00e2rlad , by only one point . Finally the yellow and blues promoted for the first time in the Divizia B at the end of the 1984\u201385 season , when they secured the first place in the detriment of Mecanica Vaslui , another team from Vaslui County , just like those from Fepa 74 .",
      "The first season in the Divizia B was ended with a well-deserved salvation from relegation after a tough battle with teams such as : Metalul Plopeni , Dun\u0103rea C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i or Chimia F\u0103lticeni . At the end of the season the club changed again its name , this time in Aripile Victoria Bac\u0103u , a mix between the two previous names : Aripile Bac\u0103u and Victoria IRA Bac\u0103u . The club relegated at the end of the season as the first one placed below the red line , at only one point from the first safe place , occupied by CS Boto\u0219ani . Back in the third tier , the Airmen turned out to be a very good team , finishing with nine points over the same Mecanica Vaslui , team that also lost the promotion battle in front of Aripile , back in 1985 .",
      "In the summer of 1988 , with the occasion of promotion , Aripile Victoria became again just Aripile and finished on the 13th place , at only one point from the relegation zone where were the old rivals from Metalul Plopeni and Fepa 74 . The next season , 1989\u201390 was the best in the history of the club which achieved an unexpected 8th place , being situated over teams such as : Foresta F\u0103lticeni , Poiana C\u00e2mpina or Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b , among others . After the Romanian Revolution of 1990 the aeronautical company and implicitly the team have been affected by disorganization from the leadership of public institutions and followed two disappointing rankings : 1990\u201391 \u2013 13th and 1991\u201392 \u2013 16th , the last result meaning also the relegation to the third league .",
      "Aerostar , a classic of Liga III ( 1992\u2013present ) .",
      "A notable event occurred in the summer of 1992 , when the club changed its name in Aerostar Bac\u0103u , change that was in fact a normal move , after the parent company also changed its name in Aerostar SA . At the end of the 1992\u201393 season the yellow and blues finished only 4th , after Constructorul Ia\u0219i , Mure\u0219ul Topli\u021ba and Harghita Odorheiu Secuiesc and nothing announced at the time the disaster that will destroy the club during the 1993\u201394 season , when due to financial problems the club was excluded from Divizia C , being subsequently dissolved . After one year of inactivity the club was refounded with the same name of Aerostar Bac\u0103u , in the summer of 1995 . The Airmen were enrolled in the Divizia D , having in the lead also a new president , in the person of Doru Damaschin . But the return of Aerostar in the national football was difficult compared to other clubs , after five tough years spent at the county level , the team from Bac\u0103u promoted back to Divizia C at the end of the 1998\u201399 season .",
      "Returned to the third tier , Aerostar never relegated again , but also has failed to promote in the second league for the next 18 years . In this period the club obtained better or less good results : 2nd ( 2007\u201308 ) , 3rd ( 1999\u20132000 , 2003\u201304 , 2004\u201305 ) , 4th ( 2005\u201306 , 2014\u201315 , 2016\u201317 ) , 5th ( 2006\u201307 ) , 6th ( 2011\u201312 ) , 7th ( 2001\u201302 , 2008\u201309 , 2015\u201316 ) , 9th ( 2000\u201301 , 2002\u201303 , 2012\u201313 ) , 10th ( 2010\u201311 ) , 11th ( 2013\u201314 ) and 12th ( 2009\u201310 ) .",
      "In the summer of 2017 due to the lack of strong football clubs in the city fact owed to the dissolution of the most important club , FCM Bac\u0103u , in the summer of 2014 , the relegation of SC Bac\u0103u at the end of the 2016\u201317 season and also to the disappearance of other clubs such as Letea , Pambac or Willy , Aerostar has also received financial support from the Municipality of Bac\u0103u in order to reach the promotion to the second tier . Cristian Popovici was chosen to be the new manager of the team and important players such as : Ionu\u021b Mih\u0103l\u0103chioaie and C\u0103t\u0103lin Vraciu signed contracts with the Airmen . The promotion battle was a very tough one and went to the last rounds when Aerostar won 1\u20130 against O\u021belul Gala\u021bi and assured its promotion in front of the Steelworkers and in front of FK Miercurea Ciuc . Therefore , Aerostar promoted back to Liga II after 26 years of absence and 18 years after its return in the Liga III , in 1999 . This promotion came as a mouth of oxygen for the football from Bac\u0103u and Bac\u0103u County at a time when Aerostar has come to be the only team that represent the city and the county in the first three leagues and at a time when the Municipal Stadium has become a ruin .",

      "Formula BMW .",
      "Sainz raced in Formula BMW Europe in 2010 with the EuroInternational team . He is also part of the Red Bull Junior Team programme . He made his Formula BMW debut during a guest drive in the Formula BMW Pacific series at Sepang . Because he was a guest driver , he was ineligible to score points , however his first races in Malaysia went very well , as he managed to get second place at the opening race .

At Valencia he scored a 7th and 10th place . A weekend at Silverstone saw him take 3rd place and a victory in the following race , his first that season . Hockenheim saw him take 11th and 6th place . A 4th and a podium position of 3rd enlightened his championship hopes but Robin Frijns was on a charge , scoring a podium position in every race but 3 , two he finished in 4th . A double retirement at Spa put an end to his championship dreams . An 8th and 6th at the season finale at Monza followed . He finished the season 4th with 227 points .",

      "During the 2012 season , Sainz raced in both British and Euro Series Formula 3 championships . Racing for Carlin , he won four races , finished nine times on the podium , as well as scoring a pole position in the British championship , finishing sixth overall in the final championship standings . He scored two podiums and two pole positions in the Euro Series championship , finishing in ninth position overall .",
      "GP3 .",
      "In 2013 , Sainz signed with Arden to compete in the GP3 series . Most Red Bull Racing Juniors race for Arden as it is co-owned by Red Bull boss Christian Horner and driver Mark Webber . His first race weekend in the series did not go as expected . During the first qualifying session of the year , he managed to qualify in 5th place and was only 5 tenths off pole sitter Kevin Korjus . However he , as well as Alex Fontana and Patrick Kujala , were penalised 10 places for ignoring yellow flags during free practice . During the beginning of race one , Sainz managed to get up to 13th place by passing Alex Fontana and Jimmy Eriksson off the start . By the start of lap 3 , he was already 13 seconds behind the leader , however , this was due to him being stuck in traffic . Sainz had made it all the way up to 8th place with his teammate Daniil Kvyat until both cars lacked grip . Because they were both pushing to get into the top ten for points , neither driver decided to manage their Pirelli tryes and so by the end of the race , Kvyat was 20th and Sainz managed to get 15th place and so effectively he never gained or lost any positions . However , worryingly for him , he finished 51 seconds off first placed man Tio Ellinas . Sainz started in 15th place for race 2 on Sunday morning . At the end of lap 1 , he managed to gain 6 places to find himself in 9th place . As they approached lap 2 , the safety car was deployed due to an accident behind , giving Sainz time to save his tyres . With 5 laps remaining , Sainz was up to 8th place . During the next lap , he managed to put a move on Jack Harveys ART car to move up into 7th place . Sainz eventually would finish in 7th place . However , post race investigating revealed the Sainzs car was underweight , and so he was disqualified from the final results from race 2 , thus scoring no points during what was a difficult weekend for not only Sainz , but for his teammate , Kvyat , who retired during the race due to contact with another driver .",
      "In Valencia , Sainz began , and finished , the race in 8th place . In race 2 , he started in 4th place and managed to get up into 3rd place by the end of lap 1 . He remained in that position , scoring a podium for the first time in GP3 . Before the weekend , Sainz had not tallied any championship points . By the time the weekend was over , Sainz had managed to obtain 24 world championship points , 4 for fastest laps in both races . He was now in 6th place in the championship and was looking healthy in the title fight .",
      "It was another bad weekend for Sainz at Silverstone , as in both races he got poor results . During the first race , Sainz was squeezed off track , falling to 9th place . By mid distance , it was all looking good and it looked even better when he managed to overtake Lewis Williamson to get into 8th place . Williamson then moved alongside Sainz to try and overtake but Sainz kept moving over towards him until there was contact . Williamson was sent into a spin whilst Sainz continued to circulate round the track . Due to the damage to his car , Sainz fell down the order until he crossed the finish line in 13th place . In race 2 , he finished where he started , in 13th place .",

He left Monza with 25 points , beating his previous seasons score by 3 points . Another win at Aragon meant he doubled his score and in race 2 , he finished in 4th . Another 4th place followed at the one race in Monaco . The weekend at Spa followed with another 2 wins . Moscow followed and he did not perform well . 14th and 6th meant that he only took 8 points from a possible 50 . At the Nurburgring Gp Circuit , he won race 1 but in race 2 , he retired . In Hungary , he was no match for Roberto Merhi who led by half a minute from the rest of the field in the wet . Another 6th place followed in race 2 .

In his first race for Renault , Sainz finished the race in 7th and outqualified Nico H\u00fclkenberg , a feat Jolyon Palmer failed to do throughout the year , although it meant very little as H\u00fclkenberg opted not to post a lap time in Q2 due to his impending grid penalties . A less impressive performance followed at the next race in Mexico . He qualified 9th , three and a half tenths down on H\u00fclkenberg in 8th , and started the race in 7th following Ricciardos engine penalties . After the first lap , he found himself in 5th place , behind H\u00fclkenberg , after championship contenders Vettel and Hamilton collided at the start of the race .

However , earlier work had also been done by the Department of Mathematics , which had built the Imperial College Computing Engine , an early digital relay computer . In 1966 , the postgraduate Centre for Computing and Automation came into being and consumed the pre-existing Computer Unit , with John Westcott migrating his Control Group from the Electrical Engineering department and joining Stanley Gill as joint head . In 1970 , Gill left for industry , the department was renamed to The Department of Computing and Control , and Westcott became the head .",
      "In 1972 , Manny Lehman joined the department and with Westcott , developed the first undergraduate course ( BSc ) . Before Lehman joined , there was some progress towards the design of an undergraduate course ; however , Lehman found this to be too mathematical and also Westcott didnt wish to compete with the hardware focus of Manchester University . Therefore , it was decided to focus the course on the creation of software and related methodologies . The first intake for the course was in 1973 , and the first graduates in 1976 . On the research front , the department held a logic programming workshop , which evolved into the ICLP ( International Conference on Logic Programming ) .",
      "The department moved to the Huxley Building in 1977 . In 1979 Westcotts term as head of department came to an end and the position was up for renewal , it was given to Lehman . During Westcotts term , the control engineers had been doing most of the research in the department , and the computer scientists doing most of the teaching ; in order to establish Computing as its own subject , then Rector Lord Flowers advised Lehman to send Westcott and his control group back to Electrical Engineering , and the department assumed its current name , the Department of Computing . Lehman started designing a Software Engineering course , his belief was that software engineering is practical by nature and as part of the course wanted students to have industrial experience . However , professional software engineering was not as it is today and Lehman founded IST to provide a place for Imperial students to get some practical experience .",
      "Throughout the 80s , the department was recognised as a leading centre for logic programming , and by 1985 the size of the logic programming group had grown to 50 . In 1980 , Keith Clark co-founded Logic Programming Associates , which aimed to apply the results of the logic programming groups research to industrial problems .",
      "When Lehmans term came up for renewal in 1984 , he was not reappointed and instead went to work full time for IST . Bruce Sayers , the then head of Electrical Engineering was appointed as head of the department . Over the course of his term , Sayers doubled the size of the department , but this increase caused office spaces to become over-occupied , and required more teaching space . To remedy this the Holland Club moved out of the Huxley Building and lecture theatres 308 and 311 were constructed in their place , furthermore , the William Penney Laboratory was constructed in 1988 . Sayers later became the head of the Centre for Cognitive Systems , which resided in the newly built William Penney Laboratory . In 1993 , IC-PARC was founded , also residing in the William Penney Laboratory . It span out in 1999 to create Parc Technologies and the centre was later shut down in 2005 .",

      "Undergraduate .",
      "The department offers both courses in Computing and joint courses in Maths and Computing . Students can apply for either the three year BEng or four year MEng course , however , the first two years are common and so students are able to switch between these courses up until the start of the third year ( provided they meet academic requirements ) . Masters students can choose to specialize in a particular field , or also study management and finance as part of their degree . The department also has ties to universities in Europe and further abroad , including UC Berkeley and MIT , allowing students on the masters course to study abroad for one year of their program . All students who obtain an undergraduate degree from the department are also awarded the Associateship of the City & Guilds Institute , ACGI .",
      "Postgraduate .",
      "The department offers MSc taught masters programs in either Computer Science , designed for graduates of other subjects , and Advanced Computing , designed for graduates of bachelors courses . The department also offers specialist masters degrees which focus on particular fields of study within computer science . The department also offers an MRes course as part of the EPSRC , and takes on PhD students . All students graduating with any of the postgraduate degrees ( MSc , MRes or PhD ) are also awarded the Diploma of Imperial College , DIC .",
      "Reputation .",
      "The department ranks seventh in the world in the Times Higher Education 2020 subject rankings , ranking third in the UK , as well as twelfth in the QS World University Rankings . Domestically , the department ranks third on the Complete University Guides 2020 computer science table , and fourth in The Guardians 2020 computer science university subject rankings . The department also produces graduates with the highest average pay of any course six months after graduation , and the highest in the subject five years out , earning an average of \u00a360,000 , ahead of second place Oxford by \u00a34,200 .",
      "Student Life .",
      "Student activities are organised by DoCSoc , the departmental society for computing students . DoCSoc is organised by a team of student volunteers , and is funded by corporate sponsors , organised as part of the City and Guilds College Union , a constituent union of Imperial College Union . It runs events social and educational events throughout the year , including ICHack , an annual hackathon open to university students from both the college and elsewhere , with over 300 participants in 2018 .",
      "DoCSoc was refounded in 1986 , and ran a magazine Whats up DoC ? by 1995 . By 1997 , student magazine was called Data , however , today the society no longer runs a magazine .",

      "Teodor Atanasiu",
      "Teodor Atanasiu ( ; born 23 September 1962 ) is a Romanian engineer and politician . A member of the National Liberal Party ( PNL ) , he was Minister of National Defence in the C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu cabinet from December 2004 to October 2006 . He was a member of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies for Alba County from 2008 to 2016 .",
      "He and his first wife had one daughter before divorcing in 2005 after twenty years of marriage . Soon afterward , he married Laura Bi\u0219boac\u0103 , a 25-year-old employee of the Alba County Council whom Atanasiu brought to Bucharest as an adviser at the Defence Ministry after being named to head that institution . The two married shortly thereafter , and have one daughter . Atanasiu later drew controversy for having Bi\u0219boac\u0103s brother hired at the Agriculture Ministry ( then controlled by a PNL colleague ) and at the Authority for State Assets Recovery once Atanasiu was in charge there ; as well as giving out jobs to his best man and business partner and to a business partner of his wifes .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early career .",
      "He was born in Cugir , Alba County and from 1982 to 1987 attended the Vehicle Construction Technology section of the Technical University of Cluj-Napocas Mechanics Faculty . From 1987 to 1995 , he was an engineer at the mechanical plant in his native town , serving as chief of production from 1995 to 1996 and as director from 1997 to 2001 . From 1994 to 1996 , he belonged to the administrative council of another factory there , while heading a water company in Alba Iulia from 1996 to 1997 . From 1997 to 2000 , he was on the administrative council of the former State Property Fund , and from 2001 to June 2004 , he administered a Dinu Patriciu-owned , Rompetrol subsidiary , pipe manufacturer in Sibiu .",
      "Atanasiu entered politics shortly after the 1989 Revolution , joining the PNL in February 1990 . From the following month until 1992 , he was secretary of the partys Cugir organisation , and its president from 1992 to 1993 . Since 1993 , he has been president of the Alba County PNL chapter . From 1992 to 1996 , he was a member of the Cugir town council , and in 1996 joined the Alba County Council , of which he was president from June to December 2004 . He was on the PNLs permanent central bureau from 2001 to 2002 and from 2005 to 2006 , also serving as a party vice president from 2006 to 2008 .",
      "Defence Minister .",
      "He was named Defence Minister at the end of 2004 , among the cited reasons being his work at the Cugir plant ( which specialised in military equipment ) and his co-authorship in 2000 of a strategy for restructuring Romanias defence industry . Among his initiatives as minister were a reorganisation of the ministry , including a fight against corruption there and an elimination of redundancies ; rest homes for combatants and houses for soldiers ; and compensatory pay for personnel dismissed as part of an ongoing reduction in size of the Romanian Armed Forces . He also promoted a law ending conscription from 2007 , a change he said would promote stability and discipline . He was in office during severe flooding in 2005 that the Army helped combat . He promoted a close strategic partnership with the United States , including a plan for building American military bases in Romania . However , despite affirming his commitment to Romanias participation in both the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan in 2005 , the following year he sought Romanias withdrawal from Iraq , a decision opposed and blocked by President Traian B\u0103sescu . Other controversies came when he implied but later backed away from the possibility of intervening militarily in Transnistrias frozen conflict ; and when he disciplined crew members of the Romanian frigate Regina Maria who went on a hunger strike .",
      "Atanasius downfall as minister began in July 2006 , when he remarked on television that the military intelligence service was spying on the presidential administration , and specifically on spokeswoman Adriana S\u0103ftoiu . This prompted S\u0103ftoiu to sue him for abuse of office , In September , by which time the Social Democratic parliamentarian Eugen Bejinariu had also sued , B\u0103sescu suspended the minister , citing the need to avoid any suspicion that the investigation might be compromised . The PNL objected to the decision , with T\u0103riceanu calling the step legal but not obligatory , and party spokesman Varujan Vosganian viewing it as retaliation for his Iraq stance . Shortly thereafter , prosecutors decided not to pursue charges , but Atanasiu remained suspended and in late October , with B\u0103sescu poised to dismiss him , resigned , despite a vow several days earlier to stay on until a judicial request he had made to be reinstated was resolved .",
      "Subsequent developments .",
      "T\u0103riceanu immediately named Atanasiu head of the Authority for State Assets Recovery ( AVAS ) , a position he held until December 2008 . He resigned because he had just been elected to the Chamber of Deputies , where he served until September 2009 on the economics , reform and privatisation committee , and continues to serve on the joint parliamentary committee providing oversight to the activities of the Romanian Intelligence Service .",
      "At the 2012 local election , he ran for president of the Alba County Council , coming in second with 40.5% of the vote and losing to the Democratic Liberal Party incumbent , the only one of his party to win such a post at the election . That autumn , he was returned to parliament . In late 2014 , he was a candidate for the PNL presidency , but withdrew from the race shortly before it was decided , casting his support behind the winner , Alina Gorghiu . Atanasiu ran for a Buz\u0103u County seat in the Senate at the 2016 election , but lost ."

      "Line 2 ( Linea Due in Italian ) , is a subway line serving Milan , Italy , operated by ATM as part of the Milan Metro . It is also called the Green Line , ( Linea Verde in Italian ) , as it is visually identified by green signs .",
      "The line runs from the southern to the north-eastern neighborhoods passing through the city centre , serving the north-eastern metropolitan area with two different branches . The line is long and has 35 stations . Line 2 is the longest line of the Milan Metro and is the only one running partially overground . The branch to Cologno Nord runs mostly on viaducts , while those to Assago and Gessate run on the surface .",
      "The line has the southernmost and easternmost stations on the network ( Assago Forum and Gessate ) .",
      "History .",
      "The first part of the line , from Caiazzo to Cascina Gobba , was opened on September 1969 .",
      "The interurban sections of Line 2 were originally built as part of a fast tramway , the Linee celeri dellAdda ( Adda fast lines ) , opened in 1968 from Cimiano up to Gorgonzola . After few years , in 1972 , the section was included in the newly born Metro line . The same section was extended in 1985 up to Gessate , the present terminus .",
      "Route .",
      "The line , 40.4-kilometre long with 35 stations , has a central section that runs from Cascina Gobba to Famagosta , and forks at both ends . The North branch runs from Cologno Sud to Cologno Nord , the North-East branch runs from Vimodrone to Gessate , the South-East branch consists of the Abbiategrasso station , the South branch runs from Assago Milanofiori Nord to Assago Milanofiori Forum .",
      "Rolling stock .",
      "There are 2 types of trains in service on the line . The first type is the ET245 , which was introduced in 1969 with the opening of the line and was the first train operated on Line 2 . ET245 are formed by three-car consists , with Bo-Bo powered units at both ends and a car between them ; normally , two consists are coupled to form a single train .",
      "This series came in two different versions for urban and suburban routes . The first had 8 doors per car and regular seats , while the latter was equipped with only 6 doors per car and more seats .",
      "Original ET245 trains are still in service on the line . Of these , some have been renewed in latest years .",
      "The second type in operation is the new AnsaldoBreda Meneghino train . The first train was introduced in April 2009 . In 2015 , the 3000 Series Leonardo followed , with the two newer series jointly replacing all the other stock , which is due to be retired by 2020 .",
      "Originally , as its own trains were not ready yet , Line 2 provisionally operated with 100/200 Series trains transferred from Line 1 .",
      "As the 300/400 Series trains were delivered starting from 1970 , the 100/200 Series trains were moved back to line 1 .",
      "The three-doors 300/400 Series trains were manufactured between 1970 and 1981 , and in 1985 the 350 Series was introduced , which was an improved version of the earlier 300 Series with four doors instead of three . 350 Series trains were produced in 2 batches between 1985 and 1991 . In 1987 the 500 Series was introduced , consisting of three experimental trains designed to test the new GTO-VVVF inverters that were to equip Line 3s 8000 Series .",
      "Planned extensions .",
      "An extension on the north from Cologno to Vimercate is planned .",

      "The 11th Army ( ) was a World War II field army .",
      "History .",
      "The 11th Army was established on 5 October 1940 as Kommandostab Leipzig , but changed its designation to Kommandostab M\u00fcnchen on 23 April 1941 . It was restructured into Heeresgruppe Don on 21 November 1942 . After being reformed on 26 January 1945 and taking part in various counter-offensives against the Soviet and US advance , the army surrendered to American troops on 23 April 1945 .",

      "The 11th Army was activated in 1940 to prepare for the forthcoming German attack on the Soviet Union .",
      "The 11th Army was part of Army Group South when it invaded the USSR during Operation Barbarossa . In September 1941 , Erich von Manstein was appointed its commander . His predecessor , Colonel-General Eugen Ritter von Schobert , perished when his Fieseler Storch aircraft landed in a Soviet minefield .",

      "The 11th Army was tasked with invading the Crimea and the pursuit of enemy forces on the flank of Army Group South during its advance into the Soviet Union .",
      "The 11th Army order of battle included three Corps : XXX Corps , which was composed of the 22nd , 72nd and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler divisions and the XI Corps , consisting of the 170th Infantry Division and the 1st and 4th Mountain Divisions ; and LIVth Corps , consisting of the 46th , 73rd and 50th Infantry Divisions . The latter formation had been in charge of the advance into the Crimean peninsula earlier in September . The Romanian 3rd Army , three Mountain brigades and three cavalry brigades , were also under von Mansteins command .",
      "Einsatzgruppe D was attached to the 11th Army .",
      "Battle of Sevastopol .",
      "The 11th Army fought in southern USSR from 1941 until mid-summer 1942 and laid siege to Sevastopol . It did not take part in Fall Blau when Army Group South attacked in Southern Russia towards the Caucasus and Stalingrad . The 11th Army cut the Soviets off from the sea at Sevastopol , thus sealing the fate of the remaining defenders . After a 248-day-long siege , an estimated 100,000 prisoners marched into captivity . For his achievements in this battle , Manstein was promoted to field marshal . A grateful Adolf Hitler also authorized the Crimean Shield to commemorate the efforts of the 11th Army . It was a costly victory , however : the 11th Armys casualties and material losses were so high it was no longer a viable fighting force in its own right . Manstein recommended that the 11th Army either cross the straits of Kerch and push into the Kuban area to aid in the capture of Rostov , or be placed into Army Group South reserve . Instead , part of the 11th Army , along with the heavy siege train , was transferred to Army Group North . Ordered to oversee Leningrads reduction , Manstein transferred with them . The remainder of the 11th Army was parcelled out to Army Group Center and Army Group South .",
      "This breakup of the 11th Army and its disappearance from the order of battle of Army Group South would have dire consequences for Nazi Germany . During the course of the following fall and winter of 1942 , the Battle of Stalingrad took place . The Luftwaffe had largely reduced the city to rubble and the presence of the Volga behind the city made it virtually impossible for the Germans to follow the classical dual pincer envelopment strategy . The Red Army now opted hugging tactics , ( keeping the front lines as close to the Axis forces as possible ) , thereby rendering tanks , aircraft , and artillery largely redundant , and placing the entire responsibility on the infantry .",
      "Although the 6th Army had managed to capture most of the city and had pushed the Soviets to the banks of the Volga river in several places , it needed several more infantry divisions ( as explained above ) , to take the city completely . In spite of repeated requests to the German high command , the 6th Army was not reinforced because no other reinforcements were available in the region , or close enough to support them . As the battle grew more intense , the Soviets counterattacked on both sides of the 6th Armys flanks and destroyed the Romanian 3rd and 4th Armies . The Soviet pincers then linked up , thereby surrounding and ultimately destroying the 6th Army .",
      "The 11th Army was de-activated on 21 November 1942 and was used to form the newly created Army Group Don .",
      "Order of Battle During the Battle for Sevastopol .",
      "The 11th Army , during the battle of Sevastopol , consisted of nine German infantry divisions ( including two taken on strength during the battle ) , in two corps , and two Romanian rifle corps , plus various supporting elements , including 150 tanks , several hundred aircraft and one of the heaviest concentrations of artillery fielded by the Wehrmacht .",

      "Preston Earnest Smith ( March 7 , 1912 October 18 , 2003 ) was the 40th Governor of Texas from 1969 to 1973 , who previously served as the lieutenant governor from 1963 to 1969 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Smith was born into a tenant farming family of 13 children in Corn Hill , a town in Williamson County , Texas , that has since been absorbed into nearby Jarrell . The family later moved to Lamesa , Texas , where Smith graduated in 1928 from Lamesa High School . In 1934 , he graduated from Texas Technological College ( now Texas Tech University ) in Lubbock with a bachelors degree in business administration . Staying in Lubbock , he founded a movie theater business and invested in real estate .",
      "Political career .",
      "Smith was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1944 and then to the Texas State Senate in 1956 . He won the Senate seat by defeating in the primary the incumbent Kilmer B . Corbin , the father of actor Barry Corbin . In 1962 , Smith won the lieutenant governors race , securing majorities in all but 16 of the 254 counties to defeat the Republican O.W . Bill Hayes .",
      "In 1968 , Smith was elected governor , a position he held for two two-year terms . He succeeded the popular Democratic Governor John B . Connally Jr. , who later switched to the Republican Party in 1973 . To win the governorship , Smith first defeated Don Yarborough in the 1968 Democratic runoff election . Several other candidates , including Dolph Briscoe , a large landholder from Uvalde in the Texas Hill Country , and former Texas Attorney General Waggoner Carr , also of Lubbock , were eliminated in the primary .",
      "Smiths inauguration on January 21 , 1969 , had what was called the flavor of the South Plains . The Texas Tech University marching band led the parade just behind the marshal and the color guard . A mounted masked Red Raider rode with the band . Governor and Mrs . Smith , both Tech graduates , followed in an open convertible . Other Smith family members rode in the parade , followed by the new lieutenant governor , Ben Barnes . The band of Lamesa High School , Smiths alma mater , was the first among the high school groups . Before the oath taking , the first to be televised in Texas history , Smith had been feted with a $25-per-place victory dinner in the Austin Municipal Auditorium , now the Long Center for the Performing Arts .",
      "Smith twice defeated Republican nominee Paul W . Eggers , a tax attorney from Wichita Falls and later Dallas , and a close friend of U.S . Senator John G . Tower . In the high-turnout general election of 1968 , Smith received 1,662,019 ballots ( 57 percent ) to Eggers 1,254,333 ( 43 percent ) . In the general election of 1970 , Smith , who had been unopposed in the Democratic primaries , received 1,197,726 votes ( 53.6 percent ) to Eggers 1,037,723 ( 46.4 percent ) - still the highest midterm year turnout in past 50 years . The state switched to four-year terms in 1974 , two years after Smith left office .",
      "In 1971 and 1972 , Smith was embroiled in the Sharpstown scandal stock fraud scheme , which eventually led to his downfall . Smith lost his third-term bid for the governorship of Texas to Dolph Briscoe of Uvalde in the Democratic primary in 1972 . He ran a distant fourth in the primary , behind Briscoe , womens activist Frances Sissy Farenthold of Corpus Christi , and Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes , formerly of Comanche County .",
      "Among his appointments , Smith in 1970 named Paul Pressler of Houston , a former state representative , as judge of the Texas 133rd District Court in Harris County . Pressler , who later switched to the Republican Party , subsequently became known as a prime leader in the Southern Baptist Convention Conservative Resurgence which began in Houston in 1979 .",
      "He appointed former State Senator Grady Hazlewood of Amarillo and Austin as a regent of Hazlewoods alma mater , West Texas A&M University in Canyon . In 1969 , Smith named state Representative Randy Pendleton of Andrews to head the Office of State and Federal Relations in Washington , D.C .",
      "Later life and attempted political comeback .",
      "In 1974 , Smith joined banker Stanton Leon Koop ( 1937\u20132008 ) , a native of Pampa , in forming the West Texas Savings Association in Lubbock . In 1986 , Koop moved to Dallas , where he was affiliated with Great Western Mortgage Company , until his retirement in 1994 .",
      "In 1978 , at the age of 66 , Smith again entered the Democratic gubernatorial primary against his intraparty rival , Governor Briscoe . Both Smith and Briscoe lost in the primary to former Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice John Hill , who in turn was narrowly defeated in the general election by Republican Bill Clements .",
      "Toward the end of his life , Smith worked as a political liaison officer for Texas Tech University . After his death in Lubbock , the airport was renamed in 2004 in his memory as Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport .",
      "Smith termed himself a conservative Democrat ; although he was generally supportive of President Lyndon B . Johnson , he refused to support his partys nominees for president in 1980 and for governor in 1982 . Instead of voting to reelect President Jimmy Carter and Mark White in the gubernatorial race , Smith cast his ballot for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clements , respectively .",
      "On October 18 , 2003 , Smith died at age 91 in the Texas Tech University Medical Center in Lubbock after being hospitalized for pneumonia . He is interred with his wife , the former Ima Mae Smith ( 1911\u20131998 ) , at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin .",

      "Frans Hals Museum",
      "The Frans Hals Museum is a museum located in Haarlem , the Netherlands .",
      "The museum was established in 1862 . In 1950 , the museum was split in two locations when the collection of modern art was moved to the Museum De Hallen ( since 2018 called Hal ) . The main collection , including its famous 17th-century Frans Hals paintings , for which the museum is named , is located in the former Oude Mannenhuis on the Groot Heiligland .",
      "The museum was founded in 1862 in the newly renovated former Dominican church cloisters located in the back of the Haarlem city hall known as the Prinsenhof , and when it needed more space , it moved to the recently vacated location of the town orphanage in 1913 . The collection is based on the large number of paintings owned by the City of Haarlem , which includes over 100 artworks seized from Catholic churches in the 1580s after the Protestant Reformation , and Haarlem art rescued from demolished local buildings from the 15th century onwards .",
      "In 2018 the museum re-merged with Museum De Hallen to form a single museum called the Frans Hals Museum with two locations : Hof ( located on Groot Heiligland ) and Hal ( located on Grote Markt ) .",
      "History of the Old Mens Almshouse .",
      "The Haarlem Oude Mannenhuis was a hofje founded in 1609 . The residential rooms were situated around a courtyard in the style of contemporary Haarlem Hofjes . Each of the thirty little houses was inhabited by two men ; to be eligible to living there they had to be at least 60 years old , honest Haarlem residents , and single . They were required to bring their own household goods listed as a bed , a chair with a cushion , a tin chamberpot , three blankets , six good shirts and six nightcaps . They were locked in each night at eight oclock in the summer and at seven in the winter . The residents had to make a weekly collection with a poor-box , and a statue of a man holding this can be seen in the entrance hall of the museum . The old mens home was governed by five regents , whose portraits , painted by Frans Hals in 1664 , are on display .",
      "Though the mens home dates from 1609 , only the main hall is still mostly intact . During the intervening centuries the complex was renovated beyond recognition , most notably by the previous inhabitants , the Haarlem municipal orphanage which made use of the complex from 1810 until 1908 , when it moved to the Coen Cuserhof . During the French occupation , the old men still living in the hofje were moved a block away to the present-day Proveniershuis , when the art collections of the two institutions were merged . The art of both locations , as well as the art of several other former Haarlem institutions , is now in the Frans Hals museum collection . The most notable artworks from the Oude Mannenhuis are the two group portraits of regents and regentesses by Frans Hals . The inventory of the Proveniershuis was drawn up by Pieter Langendijk and though some of the paintings have since been reattributed , his list is largely intact . The impressive regents rooms have been rebuilt from other Haarlem locations . A room on the street side has a curious keystone above the door with masonic symbols denoting a masons society and the text Metsselaars Proef-Kamer 1648 12/29 .",
      "History of the collection .",
      "The older pieces of the museum collection , consisting of primarily religious themes , are Haarlem relics from the Reformation , when all Roman Catholic art was formally seized by the city council in 1648 . Frans Hals himself worked as the first official city-paid restorer for some of these pieces . The city council then proceeded in the 17th century to rewrite Haarlem history , and purchased various large pieces to decorate the city hall , telling stories such as the legend of Damiate , or the legend of the Haarlem Shield . During this time the city hall functioned as a semi-public museum , though the term didnt even exist yet . The first signs of an official museum with a curator occurred when the Dutch Society of Science , founded in 1752 , started to rent the Prinsenhof room of the city hall in 1754 for its meetings and began to furnish it as a Cabinet of curiosities . From an inventory list in the city archives it can be seen that they used as a model for their system of naming and presentation , the book Amboinsche Rariteitkamer by Georg Eberhard Rumphius . They shared the room with the Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church , that used it once every six years for its meetings . They hired a woman for the dusting and serving tea , and in 1768 they hired a man as curator , who was responsible for the entire collection and the medical Hortus garden in the yard .",
      "The spacious room soon proved too small for the number of donated artifacts it received from its members , thanks to the increase in shipping and associated travel . In the late 18th century and early 19th century , Haarlem became a bedroom community of Amsterdam , with many wealthy bankers becoming members of the young Society . The old paintings became just a colorful backdrop for chests filled with stuffed animals and prepared specimens . In 1777 the Society moved its overflowing collection to a renovated house on the Grote Houtstraat , where the new young curator Martin van Marum would live the rest of his life . This building , situated next to the Mennonite church , was mortgaged with the Mennonite banker Pieter Teyler van der Hulst , who was not a member of the Society , but who created his own arts society and whose later testament would be the basis for the Teylers Museum , where van Marum would also become curator .",
      "This move essentially split the collection , and the natural history half is currently in the collection of the Teylers Museum . Though the paintings and the garden remained back at city hall , 40 years after Carl Linnaeus had published his Systema Naturae no one was interested in the garden ( which was set up as a living version of that book ) , and still fewer people were interested in the religious art . The city hall was seen as a depot of large pieces of historical importance , and the next large group of paintings to join the collection occurred when Napoleon disbanded the guilds in the Netherlands in 1794 . The guilds property reverted to the state . This is how the larger pieces that Hals painted for the guilds came into the collection . Without an official curator , the painting collection was only available to be seen by appointment with the city clerk , a situation that has remained up to the present day for the large pieces still located there , such as the whalebone from Willem Barentsz trip to Nova Zembla or the portrait of Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer .",
      "Collection as of 1862 .",
      "In the mid-19th century the back cloisters were given an extra floor for additional showing space , and it was at this time that the museum opened its doors to the public via a separate entrance than the main city hall entrance . This was also the first time that all the group portraits could be shown hanging near each other . No works of modern art were bought at that time , and the decision to form the museum was to cater to the visitors of other Haarlem museums . At the time , modern art could be seen at the nearby Teylers Eerste Schilderijenzaal in Teylers Museum , and also in the gallery of the Museum voor Levende Nederlandsche Meesters , otherwise known as the Haarlemsche Paviljoen , a museum that was open from 1838 until 1885 in the former home of Henry Hope he called Villa Welgelegen . The art critic Victor de Stuers was very angry about Haarlem being the location of such museums , as there was no artistic climate there to speak of . He criticized the collection at the Paviljoen for lacking works by contemporary painters such as Isra\u00ebls , Bosboom , Bles , Bisschop , van de Sande Bakhuijzen , Bakker Korff , and Alma Tadema , and though works by these painters were already on view at Teylers at the time , the Frans Hals museum collection only has a few paintings by the first two in their collection today . Stuers also felt it was a scandal that the city fathers in charge of the municipal museum made no effort to stop the sale of a to the Brussels museum in 1872 .",
      "Thus this antiquated collection is the one that was transferred to the Groot Heiligland in 1913 , and large pieces that were not in the cloisters at that time , such as the painting by Dirck Ferreris installed in the mayors room , remained at city hall . A few of these were formally given to the museum in 1962 , such as The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627 and The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630 . In 1962 when the museum celebrated its 100th anniversary as a municipal collection , the collection had already been split again into a modern and a classical one , with the modern art housed in a new wing on the north side of the complex . Today the modern art is displayed in the Verweyhal . The museum celebrated its 100th anniversary on the Groot Heiligland in 2013 with a Frans Hals exhibition that included reproductions being placed around the city in original locations .",
      "Collection on display .",
      "Aside from several works by Hals and other artworks originally from the collections of many former guilds , monasteries and churches of Haarlem , the collection of over 750 works also includes objects relating to Haarlem that have been acquired by local donations and purchases . The museum is specialized in restoration and research on the works of Haarlem painters in the 17th century and of the painters of the 16th century who taught them to paint , most notably Jan van Scorel , Maerten van Heemskerck , Hendrick Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem . In the late 19th century the museum became something of a pilgrimage site for young impressionists , who were fascinated by the loose brushwork visible in the two group portraits of regents by Hals that he painted when he was in his eighties . This is the reason that after the move to the present location in 1913 , the museum took on the name of Frans Hals as these were considered the most prominent paintings of the collection at the time . The museum is still famous for group portraits by Hals , but since the group portraits from the military guilds were cleaned in the early 20th century , it is these which most visitors come to see today . Most of the objects and paintings can not be displayed for lack of space , and the museum rotates its collection through exhibitions at various locations in Haarlem , though works by some prominent painters cannot be lent out and remain in storage .",
      "Installed art from other Haarlem locations .",
      "Several stately rooms saved from torn-down Haarlem houses have been partially reconstructed and a collection of Haarlem silver saved from various local churches can be seen in the former regent rooms of the almshouse , which now seem much grander than they were originally . The windows have been decorated with art by anonymous Haarlem glass artists , most of which has been acquired through municipal demolitions work . Spread along the corridors are beautiful Dutch tiles from local salvage operations that have been installed along the walls , accompanied by 17th century furniture including clocks , chairs , and chests .",
      "The museum as an institution is only responsible for its collection , which is mostly oil paintings . Other applied art that has been installed is the responsibility of the municipal culture department , and the museum rents the premises from them . This is the reason that visitors are offered much more information about the paintings than about other aspects of the building , including the objects in the courtyard .",
      "List of painters .",
      "Between 1605 and 1635 over 100,000 paintings were produced in Haarlem . Not all of these have survived , and most have left town , but this does say something about the artistic climate in the city . At that time art ownership in the city was 25% , a record high . More art has survived up to today from that period in Haarlem than from any other Dutch city , thanks mostly to the Schilder-boeck published by Karel van Mander there in 1604 . The former curator Pieter Biesboer has created inventories of Haarlem art and worked on several catalogues for the museum , mostly based on the works created before 1800 .",

In 1935 , Tarnogsky District was split off from Nyuksensky District . In 1936 , Northern Krai was transformed into Northern Oblast , and in 1937 , Northern Oblast itself was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast . Nyuksensky District remained in Vologda Oblast ever since .",

He held public office both in the German Empire and in the Weimar Republic . In 1926 , he served as interior minister of Germany in the cabinets of chancellors Hans Luther and Wilhelm Marx .",
      "Early life .",
      "K\u00fclz was born on 18 February 1875 at Borna near Leipzig in the Kingdom of Saxony . He was the son of Otto K\u00fclz ( 1839\u20131921 ) , a Protestant priest , and his wife Anna ( 1849\u20131914 , n\u00e9e Paschasius ) . He had a sister , K\u00e4the ( 1878\u20131924 ) and a twin brother , Ludwig ( 1875\u20131938 ) . From a conservative family , Wilhelm studied law at the University of Leipzig . He then served in the military ( as Reserveleutnant ) .",
      "K\u00fclz married Erna Freymond ( 1881\u20131963 ) in 1901 . They had one son , Helmut . Also in 1901 , he was awarded a doctorate at the Staatswissenschaftliche Fakult\u00e4t of the University of T\u00fcbingen with a thesis on the peacetime strength of the army . He then joined the civil service , working at various courts and as city councillor at Leipzig , Hainichen , Zittau and Meerane . In 1904 , he became mayor of B\u00fcckeburg and president of the Landtag of the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe . As an expert in administration , the Reichskolonialamt ( the Imperial ministry for the colonies ) made him Reichskommissar of the colony German South-West Africa , where he worked on establishing self-government in 1907 to 1908 .",
      "After returning to B\u00fcckeburg , K\u00fclz was a Reichstag candidate for the National Liberals in 1912 but was not elected . The same year , he was elected Oberb\u00fcrgermeister ( mayor ) of Zittau , an office that he held until 1923 .",
      "During World War I , K\u00fclz served as Hauptmann ( captain ) and Kompanief\u00fchrer .",
      "Weimar Republic .",
      "In 1919 , he joined the German Democratic Party ( DDP ) , which he represented first in the Weimar National Assembly and then from 1922 to 1932 in the Reichstag . In 1923 , he was elected as 2 . B\u00fcrgermeister of Dresden .",
      "In 1926 to 1927 , K\u00fclz served as Reichsminister des Innern ( interior minister ) in the second cabinet of Hans Luther and the third cabinet of Wilhelm Marx .",
      "Elected as Oberb\u00fcrgermeister ( mayor ) of Dresden in 1931 , K\u00fclz was removed from office by the Reichskommissar for Saxony in March 1933 , after he had refused to hoist a flag with the Nazi swastika over city hall . Until 1945 , he was active as a private entrepreneur .",
      "Postwar .",
      "After 1945 , he took a leading role in establishing the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany ( LDPD ) . He founded the Berlin branch of the LDPD in the summer of 1945 and acted as LDPD chairman from November 1945 after the first leader , Waldemar Koch , had been deposed by Soviet orders .",
      "On 17 March 1947 , in a conference in Rothenburg ob der Tauber K\u00fclz and Theodor Heuss were elected co-chairmen of the planned Democratic Party of Germany ( DPD ) , aimed at uniting liberals of both the Soviet and the Western occupation zones .",
      "The plans were never realised since Wilhelm K\u00fclz , unlike the East German CDU leader , Jakob Kaiser , participated in SED-dominated Deutscher Volkskongress ( German Peoples Congress for Unity and True Peace ) that took place on 6 December 1947 . That brought about internal confrontations both within the LDPD as well as between the East and West German partners in the DPD . Although the LDPD leadership criticised that participation , it was unable to take any further steps demanded by the West German liberals .",
      "During a session of the united leadership of the DPD that took place on 18 January 1948 and K\u00fclz refused to attend , Heuss argued that the Liberal Democrats unwillingness to take any measures against K\u00fclz proved their commitment to the Russian conception of German unity . Arthur Lieutenant , the spokesman of the LDPD on the matter , declared that under those circumstances and considering reproaches laid against East German liberals , no further co-operation was possible . That was in fact the end of DPD .",
      "Together with Otto Nuschke ( CDU ) and Wilhelm Pieck ( SED ) , Wilhelm K\u00fclz led the German Peoples Council ( Deutscher Volksrat ) , forerunner of Volkskammer of GDR . From 1945 on , K\u00fclz was the publisher of the LDPD daily Der Morgen .",
      "In March 1948 , K\u00fclz once again was the representative of the LDPD at the Deutscher Volkskongress , organized at the behest of the Soviet authorities and the SED .",
      "On the morning of 10 April 1948 , K\u00fclz was found by his party deputy , Arthur Lieutenant , to have died in the night at his Berlin apartment , apparently from a heart attack .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Although he was mostly unknown in West Germany and still is in Germany , K\u00fclz was viewed in East Germany as a prime example of a bourgeois but upright citizen who found his way to socialism . He was seen as one of the founding fathers of East Germany .",

      "Namesake .",
      "Frank Olga Slater was born on 19 December 1920 in Kennamer Cove , Alabama , one of twelve children of James Lafayette Slater , a sharecropper and Lenora ( Morgan ) Slater . He grew up in Fyffe , Alabama . He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 10 February 1942 . Upon completion of his basic training , he was transferred to the Receiving Station at Pearl Harbor , and assigned to the heavy cruiser on 4 April 1942 . On 12 November 1942 he was killed in action at his battle station during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal . He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross .",
      "Construction and career .",
      "USS Slater was laid down on 9 March 1943 , she was christened on 20 Feb 1944 by Lenora Slater , mother of Frank Olga Slater and launched on 20 February 1944 . The ship was commissioned on 1 May 1944 . She was built at the Tampa Shipbuilding Company in Tampa , Florida .",
      "After a shakedown cruise near Bermuda in June 1944 , Slater was sent to Key West where she served as a target ship and a sonar school ship . In the latter part of 1944 , Slater escorted two convoys to the United Kingdom . She continued serving in this capacity from January 1945 until May 1945 .",
      "When the war in Europe ended , Slater headed to the Pacific , stopping at Guantanamo Bay and Panama . She went through the Panama Canal on 28 June 1945 and stopped at San Diego before sailing to Pearl Harbor . From there she joined Task Unit 33.2.4 at Manila in September and escorted it to Yokohama . Slater engaged in support operations in the Pacific through the remainder of the year . She made another passage through the Canal on her way to Norfolk for deactivation . Slater was placed in the reserve fleet at Green Cove Springs , Florida in 1947 .",
      "Greek service .",
      "On 1 March 1951 , Slater was transferred to the Hellenic Navy under the Truman Doctrine , and renamed Aetos ( Eagle ) ( D01 ) . Along with three other Cannon-class ships , she made up what was known as the Wild Beasts Flotilla . The ship did patrol duty in the eastern Aegean and the Dodecanese and also served as a training vessel for naval cadets . Aetos was decommissioned in 1991 , and Greece donated the ship to the Destroyer Escort Sailors Association .",
      "Retirement .",
      "Destroyer escort sailors from around the nation donated more than a quarter of a million dollars to bring Slater back to the United States as a museum ship . A Russian ocean-going tugboat towed the ship from Crete to New York City in 1993 , where it was docked next to the aircraft carrier . Volunteers began restoring the ship and seeking a permanent home for her ; Albany , New York was decided upon . On Sunday 26 October 1997 , Slater arrived at the Port of Albany . In January 2006 , a welder accidentally started a fire aboard Slater which caused some minor damage to the ship . Repairs were completed within a few months . Restoration of the ship remains an ongoing project .",
      "On 7 May 1998 , Slater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
      "Slater was refitted several times during her long service with two navies . One of her depth-charge racks and four K-gun depth charge launchers have been removed . Two twin Bofors 40 mm guns have been added , and the ten single 20 mm guns have been replaced with nine twin mounts .",
      "Appearances in film .",
      "Slater has been featured in two motion pictures .

      "HMS Warrior ( R31 )",
      "HMS Warrior was a light aircraft carrier which was ordered in 1942 by the British Royal Navy during World War II . Construction was finished in 1945 and upon completion , the aircraft carrier was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy from 1946 to 1948 as HMCS Warrior . Warrior was returned to the Royal Navy in 1948 and entered service with the British . While in service with the Royal Navy , Warrior was modernised twice , including the installation of an angled flight deck in 1956 . In 1948\u20131949 , the ship was used in aircraft landing experiments and fitted with a rubber flight deck and in 1957 , was used as the headquarters ship during nuclear testing at Christmas Island . In 1958 , the vessel was sold to the Argentine Navy and entered Argentine service in 1959 as ARA Independencia . The aircraft carrier remained in service until 1970 when Independencia was placed in reserve . The following year , the ship was sold for scrap .",
      "Description .",
      "Warrior was a Colossus-class light aircraft carrier that was long between perpendiculars and overall with a beam at the waterline of and an overall width of . The ship had a mean draught of . Warrior had a standard displacement of when built and a full load displacement of . The aircraft carrier had a flight deck long that was wide and was above the water . The flight deck tapered to at the bow . For takeoffs , the flight deck was equipped with one BH 3 aircraft catapult capable of launching aircraft at . For landings , the ship was fitted with 10 arrestor wires capable of stopping a aircraft , with two safety barriers rated at stopping a 15,000-pound aircraft at Warrior had two aircraft elevators located along the centreline of the ship that were and could handle aircraft up to 15,000 pounds on a 36-second cycle . The aircraft hangar was with a further section beyond the aft elevator , all with a clearance of . The hangar was divided into four sections by asbestos fire curtains . The hangar was fully enclosed and could only be entered by air locks and the lifts , due to the hazardous nature of aviation fuel and oil vapours . The vessel had stowage for of aviation fuel .",
      "The ship was powered by steam created by four Admiralty 3-drum type boilers driving two Parsons geared turbines , each turning one shaft . The machinery was split into two spaces , each containing two boilers and one turbine , separated by spaces containing aviation fuel . The spaces were situated en echelon within the ship to prevent a single disabling torpedo strike . The engines were rated at and the vessel had a capacity for of fuel oil , with an range of at . The ships maximum speed was . There was no armour aboard the vessel save for mantlets around the torpedo storage area . There were no longitudinal bulkheads , but the transverse bulkheads were designed to allow the ship to survive two complete sections of the ship being flooded .",
      "Warrior was designed to handle up to 42 aircraft . The aircraft carrier carried a wide range of ordnance for their aircraft from torpedoes , depth charges , bombs , 20 mm cannon ammunition and flares . For anti-aircraft defence , the aircraft carrier was initially armed with four twin-mounted and twenty single-mounted 40 mm Bofors guns . The original radar installation included the Type 79 and Type 281 long-range air search radars , the Type 293 and Type 277 fighter direction radar and the YE aircraft homing beacon . The ship had a maximum ships company of 1,300 , which was reduced in peacetime .",
      "Construction and career .",
      "The contract to construct Warrior was placed on 7 August 1942 . Warrior was built by Harland and Wolff at their yard in Belfast and given the yard number 1224 , originally to be called Brave . Before construction began , the ships name was changed to Warrior and the keel was laid down on 12 December 1942 . The aircraft carrier was launched on 20 May 1944 and was the last of the Colossus class to finish construction . The Royal Navy had originally intended to rush Warrior into service for operations in the Indian Ocean during the Second World War , thus she was built without heaters for some onboard equipment since heat was unnecessary in tropical operations .",
      "Royal Canadian Navy service .",
      "As the focus of future operations at sea during the Second World War shifted to the Pacific theatre , planning began in May 1944 that the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) would require a larger fleet both in numbers and in size of ships . In the effort to get bigger , the RCN returned the escort carriers then on loan , and , in exchange for the loan of two light fleet carriers . A formal approach was first made in July , with negotiations being finalised in April 1945 when Warrior and were acquired on loan with the option to purchase them outright at a later date . Negotiations were completed in May for the naval air squadrons that would be needed to man the aircraft carrier , however the war ended before the ships were completed .",
      "After the agreement with Canada went through , Canadian naval aviation was established with the formation of four squadrons transferred from the Fleet Air Arm intended to fly from Warrior ; 803 Squadron and 883 Squadron equipped with Supermarine Seafires and 825 Squadron and 826 Squadron with Fairey Fireflys . Warrior was completed , transferred to the RCN and commissioned as HMCS Warrior on 24 January 1946 and placed under the command of Captain Frank Houghton . Sea trials were completed in March and flying trials were performed at Spithead following that . For the voyage to Canada , 803 and 825 Squadrons were embarked , while 883 and 826 Squadrons were paid off .",
      "Warrior entered Halifax harbour on 31 March 1946 , a week after leaving Portsmouth . She was escorted by the destroyer and the minesweeper , having officially joined the Canadian Atlantic Fleet on 23 March . April through May was spent alongside fixing builders defects before the ship began major fleet operations . In August , the aircraft carrier had its first loss , when a Firefly from 825 Squadron ditched , though both the pilot and observer were recovered . That same month , on 23 August while transiting the St . Lawrence River , Warrior ran aground at Pointe Sainte Antoine , near Montreal while en route to the city after her rudder jammed . Tugboats got the aircraft carrier unstuck from the mud bank she had run into the same day and Warrior continued on to Montreal where she became the largest ship to visit that port to that date .",
      "The RCN experienced problems with the unheated equipment during operations in cold North Atlantic waters off eastern Canada during 1946 . The ship was transferred west to Esquimalt , British Columbia in November 1946 , visiting Bermuda , Acapulco , Mexico and San Diego , California before arriving in December . On 18 January 1947 , Commodore Harry DeWolf took command of Warrior while the vessel was undergoing repairs to the damages to her hull that had been received during her August grounding . On 31 January , one 825 Squadrons Fireflys was lost along with its pilot off Portland Island during a training mission . It was during this period , that the RCN , facing reduced defence spending and manning constraints , came to the conclusion that they could not operate two aircraft carriers . Negotiations began to return Warrior when Magnificent became ready , with the RCN deeming Warrior unfit for service due to her lack of heating . In February 1947 , the aircraft carrier began her voyage back to Halifax , accompanied by the cruiser and destroyer . The Canadian group stopped at San Pedro , California before the aircraft carrier transited the Panama Canal by herself , meeting the destroyers and Micmac on the other side . The three Canadian ships visited Havana , Cuba , marking the first time a Canadian warship had visited the Cuban capital since 1929 . Warrior returned to Halifax on 27 March . The ship then sailed for Bermuda with Nootka to take part in a naval exercise with the Royal Navy . Most of mid-1947 was spent undergoing repairs at Halifax and performing short cruises along east coast . In August , Warrior sailed for the United Kingdom where her squadrons would be re-equipped with Firefly Mark IV and Hawker Sea Fury aircraft , returning to Halifax on 28 August . Meanwhile , preparations were being made for the return of Warrior and the acquisition of Magnificent . In November , Magnificents air group consisting of 826 and 883 Squadrons trained aboard Warrior off the coast of Nova Scotia . Following this , Warrior , escorted by the destroyer sailed to Bermuda where the ship was prepared to be paid off . The ship sailed for the UK on 12 February , arriving at Belfast on 20 February . On 1 March the ship moved to Spithead where the aviation fuel was removed . Warrior was returned to the Royal Navy on 23 March 1948 at Portsmouth .",
      "Royal Navy service .",
      "HMCS Warrior returned to the United Kingdom and was recommissioned as HMS Warrior on 23 March 1948 . Warrior was then refitted at Devonport and equipped with a flexible flight deck to test the feasibility of receiving undercarriage-less aircraft ; modified de Havilland Sea Vampire aircraft were used to test the concept , which was successful but not introduced into service . The flexible deck was composed of a rubber sheet supported by air bags . The new deck extended from the bow to the barrier forward of the island and was superimposed on the existing flight deck . Aft of the flexible deck , a light steel ramp was placed over the flight deck rising to in height with a single arrestor wire . The trials lasted from November 1948 to March 1949 and upon completion , Warrior was paid off into the reserve at Portsmouth .",
      "Warrior was reactivated in June 1950 and modified to carry troops and aircraft to the Far East during the Korean War , departing in August on the first such mission . In June 1951 , with 16 Parachute Brigade embarked , Warrior sailed to Cyprus in response to a crisis in the Middle East . The ship underwent refit during most of 1952 and 1953 at Devonport Dockyard . The ship was fitted with a new lattice mast and new radars with Type 281Q fitted to the mast and Type 277Q radars installed fore and aft of the island . Identification friend or foe aerials were also installed on the mast . The bridge was enlarged and enclosed . The Fleet Air Arm 811 Squadron in Sea Furys and 825 Squadron in Fireflys were embarked after sea trials . During 1954 Warrior was deployed to the Far East , patrolling off the coast of Korea , following the ceasefire . In September the ship was among those sent to evacuate non-Communist refugees from Haiphong , North Vietnam to Vung Tau , South Vietnam , transporting more than 3,221 people in two voyages , and being awarded a South Vietnamese Presidential Citation .",
      "After returning to England another refit was carried out in 1955 at Devonport . This time Warrior received an angled flight deck of 5 degrees for trials . To install the angled deck , portside sponsons were removed , the angled deck installed portside amidships and the deck itself was upgraded to take aircraft up to . Furthermore , the catapult was upgraded to launch 20,000-pound aircraft and the arrester wire system improved to take the same weight of aircraft at . The aircraft carrier also received a mirror landing aid and Type 961 CCA radar . As the only ship in the class to receive the upgrade , it was intended to turn Warrior into a training and trials ship .",
      "Following a short period as a training ship , Warrior was dispatched to the Pacific Ocean , where the aircraft carrier took part in Operation Grapple , the first British hydrogen bomb tests , as the headquarters ship embarking a flight of Westland Whirlwind helicopters and Grumman Avenger AS4 aircraft to collect air samples from the tests and ferry them back for examination . After the operation was completed the Avengers were catapulted into the sea as they were contaminated with radioactivity . Considered surplus to requirements by the late 1950s , the Royal Navy decommissioned Warrior in February 1958 and offered her for sale . The return voyage from the Grapple tests was via Argentina , with port visits and demonstrations to the Argentine Navy , to whom the Admiralty was trying to sell her .",
      "Argentine Navy service .",
      "Warrior was sold to Argentina in 1958 and renamed ARA Independencia on 6 August 1958 . The Argentinian naval ensign was raised on 4 November at Portsmouth and sailed for Argentina on 10 December . Argentine Naval Aviation began air operations from Independencia on 8 June 1959 , even before the vessel was officially commissioned into the fleet . The ship was commissioned into the Argentine Navy on 8 July 1959 . The anti-aircraft armament was initially reduced to twelve 40 mm guns , soon further reduced to eight . In May 1962 the ship was however provided with one quadruple and nine double mountings of that caliber . After all the modifications the displacement of the ship had climbed to while the vessels maximum speed had declined to .",
      "The air group , which had a maximum 24 aircraft , was mainly formed from Vought F4U Corsairs , North American SNJ-5Cs Texans and Grumman S2F-1 ( S-2A ) Trackers . Naval Aviation inventory also included Grumman F9F Panther ( the first jet fighters in service with the Argentine Naval Aviation , starting from August 1963 which launched from Independencia ) and TF-9J Cougar jets , although Independencia proved to be unsuitable for operating them . The ship also used the North American T-28 Trojan trainer . After the aircraft carrier entered service in 1969 , Independencia moved to the reserve in 1970 . She was scrapped in 1971 ."

      "Isidores father H\u00e9lie Taylor was English born and took French nationality . His mother was the Belgian Marie-Jacqueline Walwein ( from what was then the Austrian Netherlands ) . Originally destined for a military career , the young man neglected this in favour of travelling about Europe and later the Near East . Among the fruits of his travels was a series of books on the French regions , Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans lancienne France ( 1820\u201363 ) , the nearly 7000 lithographs in which were the first to catalogue the French artistic patrimony . Another book , La Syrie , l\u00c9gypte , la Palestine et la Jud\u00e9e ( Paris , 1839 ) , was illustrated with the authors watercolours , two of which are now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum .",
      "George Borrow describes meeting Taylor in his The Bible in Spain . He has visited most portions of the earth , and it is remarkable enough that we are continually encountering each other in strange places and under singular circumstances . Whenever he descries me , whether in the street or the desert , the brilliant hall or amongst Bedouin haimas , at Novgorod or Stambul , he flings up his arms and exclaims , O ciel ! I have again the felicity of seeing my cherished and most respectable B\u2026 . Ennobled in 1825 by King Charles X , he was by this time collecting Spanish art on behalf of the new French King Louis Philippe I , who made him a Commissioner of Art in 1838 . These paintings constituted the then named Spanish gallery of the Louvre .",
      "Previously , he had been very active in the theatrical world and was made Royal Commissioner of the Theatre Francaise between 1825-38 . During this period he used his position to encourage the production of Romantic drama . Among those he helped was Alexandre Dumas , who dedicated to Taylor his first successful play , Henri III et sa cour ( The court of Henry III , 1829 ) . Taylor himself authored plays with a Levantine background , Ismael et Maryam , ou larabe et la chr\u00e9tienne ( The Arab and the Christian , 1821 ) and La fille de lH\u00e9breu et le chevalier du temple ( The Jewess and the Templar , 1823 ) and co-authored with Charles Nodier an adaptation of Charles Maturins successful drama , Bertram ou le pirate ( 1821 ) .",
      "From the 1840s he began his philanthropic activity by setting up a series of mutual societies for members of the artistic professions that have continued to this day as the Taylor Foundation . In recognition of his work he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1847 , named a senator of the Second Empire in 1869 and made an officer of the Legion of Honour in 1877 .",
      "Artistic representations .",
      "After his death , Taylor was buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery with a memorial statue by sculptor Gabriel-Jules Thomas . A decorative bust by Tony Noel ( 1845-1909 ) was also erected on behalf of the Taylor Foundation on the Boulevard Saint Martin . Both of these show the baron in old age . There were attractive earlier portraits of him by Jean Alaux when he was 22 , and by Federico de Madrazo y Kuntz at the age of 44 . The latter is a three-quarters bust that pictures him in his official uniform in 1838 . He also figures in the crowded canvas of Edouard Manets Music in the Tuileries ( 1862 ) . Taylor is pictured in the mid-foreground to the left with his cane beneath his arm as he talks to Charles Baudelaire and Theophile Gautier .",

      "Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton , FBA ( ; 17 February 1900 \u2013 17 September 1993 ) was a Canadian classical scholar and leading Latin prosopographer of the twentieth century . He is especially noted for his definitive three-volume work , Magistrates of the Roman Republic ( 1951-1986 ) .",
      "Life and career .",
      "Broughton was born in 1900 in Corbetton , Ontario . He attended Victoria College at the University of Toronto . There he received a B.A . in 1921 with honors in classics . He earned his M.A . in 1922 . After studying at the University of Chicago , he was made a Rogers Fellow at Johns Hopkins University , where he received a Ph.D . in Latin in 1928 , having studied under the famed ancient historian Tenney Frank ( 1876-1939 ) .",
      "He began his teaching career at Victoria College , Toronto . Broughton would go on to teach at Amherst College , Bryn Mawr College ( 1928-1965 ) and , later , serve as George L . Paddison Professor of Latin at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ( 1965-1971 ) , where the Library Epigraphy Room , created at his behest , remains a seminal resource . Although he retired from UNC in 1971 ( then aged 71 ) , he would continue to work and advise students until his death in 1993 .",
      "In 1931 , he married Annie Leigh Hobson Broughton of Norfolk , Virginia . They had two children , Margaret Broughton Tenney and T . Alan Broughton ( b . 1936 ) , a poet and pianist and professor emeritus of the University of Vermont . Mrs . Broughton died on September 19 , 2005 , in Charleston , South Carolina .",
      "Magistrates of the Roman Republic .",
      "Broughtons main scholarly work was his massive , three-volume Magistrates of the Roman Republic ( commonly abbreviated MRR ) , published 1951 to 1986 and requiring more than 30 years to complete . The project provides an unparalleled accounting of the names of men elected to office during the Roman Republic and has become a standard reference work . It provides a year-by-year list of all known office-holders , including not only the magistracies of the cursus honorum from consul to quaestor , but also promagistracies and military commands in the provinces , legates ( both official and ad hoc ) , military prefects , priesthoods , and special commissions . Each entry is documented with ancient sources and selected works of modern scholarship . An index by name , listing each mans known offices , appears in volume 2 .",
      "In 1953 the Magistrates of the Roman Republic was recognized with the Charles J . Goodwin Awards of Merit from the American Philological Association .",
      "Achievements and awards .",
      "Broughtons career included a variety of academic appointments and awards : visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University , Simon F . Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow , holder of a Fulbright research grant to Italy and professor in charge of the School of Classical Studies of the American Academy in Rome .",
      "Broughton served as president of the American Philological Association and as vice president of the International Federation of Societies of Classical Studies for 10 years . He was a member of the American Philosophical Society , a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , an honorary member of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies , a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute and a corresponding Fellow of the British Academy . Three universities awarded him honorary LL.D . degrees : Johns Hopkins University in 1969 , the University of Toronto in 1971 and UNC in 1974 .",
      "After Broughtons death in September 1993 , a Colloquium was organised for November 1994 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in honour of his memory . The papers delivered on this occasion , including those by eminent scholars such as T.P . Wiseman , Erich S . Gruen , and Ernst Badian , later formed the basis of the honorific volume Imperium Sine Fine : T . Robert S . Broughton and the Roman Republic , edited by J . Linderski .",

      "Writers Guild of America West",
      "The Writers Guild of America West ( WGAW ) is a labor union representing film , television , radio , and new media writers . It was formed in 1954 from five organizations representing writers , including the Screen Writers Guild . It has around 20,000 members .",
      "History .",
      "The Screen Writers Guild ( SWG ) was formed in 1921 by a group of ten screenwriters in Hollywood angered over wage reductions announced by the major film studios . The group affiliated with the Authors Guild in 1933 and began representing TV writers in 1948 . In 1954 , the SWG was one of five groups who merged to represent professional writers on both coasts and became the Writers Guild of America , East ( WGAe ) and West ( WGAw ) . Howard J . Green and John Howard Lawson were the first two presidents during the SWG era . Daniel Taradash was president of the WGAw from 1977 to 1979 .",
      "In 1952 , the Guild authorized movie studios to delete onscreen credits for any writers who had not been cleared by Congress , as part of the industrys blacklisting of writers with alleged Communist or leftist leanings or affiliations .",
      "From March to August 1988 , WGAw members were on strike against the major American television networks in a dispute over residuals from repeat airings and foreign/home video use of scripted shows and made-for-TV movies . The 22-week strike crippled American broadcast television and drove millions of viewers , disgusted with the lack of new scripted programming , to cable channels and home video , a blow to ratings and revenues from which , some industry watchers argue , the networks have never fully recovered .",
      "In 2004 , Victoria Riskin resigned as WGAw President after being accused by her opponent Eric Hughes during the 2003 election of using a sham writing contract to maintain her membership status . She was replaced by vice-president Charles Holland , who resigned a few weeks later when questions arose about statements he had made about his college football career and his claim of having secretly served in combat as a Green Beret , a claim his army records did not support . After Riskins resignation , the U.S . Department of Labor investigated the sham contract and concluded that Riskin was indeed ineligible to run . The WGAw entered into a settlement by offering to re-run the election under DOL supervision . A new election was held in September 2004 between Eric Hughes and Daniel Petrie , Jr . which Petrie won .",
      "On April 17 , 2019 , WGA West and WGA East filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against the four dominant Hollywood talent agencies , William Morris Agency , Creative Artists Agency , United Talent Agency and ICM Partners , citing movie packaging fee practices , which the WGA asserts are a violation of state and federal laws . Approximately 95 percent of Guild members voted in favor of a code of conduct that would cease packaging fees .",
      "During the week following its lawsuit filing ; en masse , over 7,000 Guild members fired their talent agents , as not just drastically out-earning them , but preventing them from receiving better pay . WGA president David A . Goodman was then quoted as stating to NPR that in a period of unprecedented profits and growth of our business .. . writers themselves are actually earning less .",
      "Reality united .",
      "In June 2005 , WGAw started a reality rights campaign to allow writers of reality television shows to qualify for guild rights and benefits . The union maintained that the storytellers who conceive the tests and confrontations on such shows were bona fide writers . The Guild also expressed concern the 1988 strike showed that lack of representation in the genre would weaken their future bargaining position . Studio executives maintained that these employees were primarily editors , not writers , and that the shows needed to appear to be unscripted in order for viewers to feel they were real .",
      "As part of this campaign , on September 20 , 2006 the WGAw held a Los Angeles unity rally in support of the Americas Next Top Model writers strike . President Patric Verrone said , Every piece of media with a moving image on a screen or a recorded voice must have a writer , and every writer must have a WGA contract .",
      "On November 6 , 2006 , the WGAw filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board after Top Model producers said the shows next season would be produced using a new system that would not require writers . In response , Verrone said , as they demanded union representation , the company decided they were expendable . This is illegal strikebreaking .",
      "2007\u201308 strike .",
      "On November 2 , 2007 , the Guild again went on strike , this time over writers share of revenues from DVD releases and from Internet , cellphone shows , and other new media uses of programs and films written by members . The strike vote followed the expiration of the guilds contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers .",
      "Governance .",
      "The WGAw is governed by its membership . Elections for a board of directors are held annually by secret mail-in ballot . Half of the board is elected each year to a two-year term of office , and a board member may not serve more than four consecutive terms . In 2017 the officers are :",

      "David Young is employed as the Guilds executive director and Tony Segall is general counsel . Young served as the Guilds chief negotiator during the 2007 contract negotiations and subsequent 100-day strike .",

( born November 15 , 1988 ) , known professionally as B.o.B , is an American rapper , singer , songwriter , record producer , and conspiracy theorist from Decatur , Georgia . In 2006 , B.o.B was discovered by Brian Richardson , who then introduced him to TJ Chapman , who subsequently brought him to American record producer Jim Jonsin . After hearing his music , Jonsin signed B.o.B to his Rebel Rock Entertainment imprint . Two years later , Jonsin and B.o.B signed a joint venture deal , with Atlantic Records and American rapper T.I.s Grand Hustle Records .",
      "B.o.B quickly rose to fame after his commercial debut single Nothin on You ( featuring Bruno Mars ) , reached number one in both the United States and the United Kingdom in 2009 . He would later release his third single Airplanes ( featuring Hayley Williams of Paramore ) , which also topped several major music charts .

      "Bobby Ray Simmons Jr . was born on November 15 , 1988 in Winston-Salem , North Carolina . He played the trumpet in his school band from elementary school through high school . Although his parents wanted him to continue his education , B.o.B decided in sixth grade that he wanted to pursue a music career . His father , a pastor , disapproved of his sons choices , until he realized B.o.B was using music as a form of therapy and a creative outlet . B.o.B later reflected on his experience , saying , Theyve always supported me . They got my first keyboard to make beats on and they helped me out getting equipment here and there . But it was kind of hard for them to really understand what I was really trying to accomplish . B.o.B attended Columbia High School in Decatur , Georgia , where he played the trumpet in the school band , until he landed a record deal and decided to drop out of school in the ninth grade .",
      "In 2002 , after meeting his mentor and co-manager B-Rich at the age of 14 , B.o.B sold his first beat to former Slip-n-Slide recording artist Citti , for the song Im the Cookie Man . B.o.B felt he had established a substantial career . I went and blew all of my money on fast stuff like a chain and ballin . Soon I was broke again , but I learned two important things from it ; make sure I save my money and that I was hooked on music . He continued performing at open mics and underground venues to perfect his craft . In 2006 , because he was underage , B-Rich helped sneak B.o.B into Club Crucial , a night club owned by Atlanta-based rapper T.I . There , B.o.B performed a song titled Cloud 9 , a self-produced , spoken word-like ode to marijuana . In attendance was producer and industry veteran T.J . Chapman , chief executive officer ( CEO ) of TJs DJs . Chapman agreed to co-manage B.o.B , which only a month later led to B.o.Bs signing with Atlantic Records and subsidiary imprint Rebel Rock , run by Florida-based producer Jim Jonsin . His first single for Atlantic , 2007s Haterz Everywhere , reached the top five of Billboards Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop singles chart . Along with his solo production career , B.o.B is part of the production/rap group HamSquad , along with Playboy Tre , DJ Swatts , DJ Smooth , Moss B , B-Rich and TJ Chapman .",

His influence on her spiritual development is apparent in her diaries ; as well as teaching her how to deal with her depressive and egocentric episodes he introduced her to the Bible and St . Augustine and helped her develop a deeper understanding of the work of Rilke and Dostoyevsky .",
      "Her diaries record the increasing anti-Jewish measures imposed by the occupying German army , and the growing uncertainty about the fate of fellow Jews who had been deported by them . As well as forming a record of oppression her diaries describe her spiritual development and deepening faith in God .",
      "When round-ups of Jews intensified in July 1942 she took on administrative duties for the Jewish Council , voluntarily transferring to a department of Social Welfare for People in Transit at Westerbork transit camp . She worked there for a month , but returned in June 1943 , by which time she had refused offers to go into hiding in the belief that her duty was to support others scheduled to be transported from Westerbork to the concentration camps in German-occupied Poland and Germany . On 5 July 1943 , her personal status was suddenly revoked and she became a camp internee along with her father , mother and brother Mischa .",
      "On 7 September 1943 , the family were deported from Westerbork to Auschwitz . Only Jaap Hillesum did not go with them ; he arrived in Westerbork after their removal and in February 1944 was sent to Bergen-Belsen , dying shortly after its liberation in April 1945 .",
      "Etty Hillesums parents are recorded as having died on 10 September 1943 , suggesting they died in transit or were gassed immediately upon their arrival . Mischa Hillesum remained in Auschwitz until October 1943 , when he was moved to the Warsaw Ghetto , where , according to the Red Cross , he died before 31 March 1944 . Etty died in Auschwitz on 30 November 1943 .",
      "Personal growth and philosophy .",
      "Etty Hillesum\u2019s youth was chaotic and turbulent , possibly resulting from her emotionally unstable family , to which she herself referred as a madhouse . Her diaries reflect the inner turmoil that she experiences during her young adulthood , as well as the healing and growth during the years before her murder .",
      "Russian authors and Christian mystics likely contributed to Hillesum\u2019s understanding of spirituality . She did not strive for ecstasy , but longed to meet the depth of her own interior and life itself . Her spirituality was not confined to her intellectual",
      "understanding of a greater power and is reflected in her diaries . In the concentration camp of Westerbork , she had unusual experiences of spiritual awakenings and insight : Those two months behind barbed wire have been the two richest and most intense months of my life , in which my highest values were so deeply confirmed . I have learnt to love Westerbork . Hillesum addressed God repeatedly in her diaries , regarding him not as a saviour , but as a power we must nurture inside of us : Alas , there doesn\u2019t seem to be much You Yourself can do about our circumstances , about our lives . Neither do I hold You responsible . You cannot help us , but we must help You and defend Your dwelling place inside us to the last .",
      "Rachel Bremer described Hillesum\u2019s life in two stages the stage of preparation and the stage of test . The preparatory stage refers to Hillesum\u2019s self-reflection and development during her time in Amsterdam . The testing stage , on the other hand , refers to her life at the concentration camp . Still in Amsterdam , Hillesum developed an ideology of showing others the way to their own interior in a time of great adversity \u2013 the Nazi terror . Her time at Westerbork \u2013 as reflected in her diaries \u2013 portrays the redemption of her spirit , while her body was captured and eventually murdered . She neither denies the horror of the Nazi terror , nor identifies with her victimhood . In the midst of extreme conditions , Hillesum develops an awareness of the indestructible beauty of this world . She writes during her time at Westerbork : The sky is full of birds , the purple lupins stand up so regally and peacefully , two little old women have sat down for a chat , the sun is shining on my face \u2013 and right before our eyes , mass murder.. . The whole thing is simply beyond comprehension . Hillesum continuously writes from a place of great tenderness , empathy , and realization .",
      "Hillesum suffers great inner turmoil during her young adulthood , but increasingly transforms into a woman of maturity and wisdom . She writes : Everywhere things are both very good and very bad at the same time . The two are in balance , everywhere and always . I never have the feeling that I have got to make the best of things ; everything is fine just as it is . Every situation , however miserable , is complete in itself and contains the good as well as the bad . In touch with the equilibrium of a bigger picture she is aware of , she continuously draws from this place to find meaning in her current reality . On 7 September 1943 , less than 3 months before her murder , she threw a postcard with her final words out of a train : Opening the Bible at random I find this : \u2018The Lord is my high tower . I am sitting on my rucksack in the middle of a full freight car . Father , Mother , and Mischa are a few cars away . In the end , the departure came without warning.. . We left the camp singing.. . Thank you for all your kindness and care .",
      "Others\u2019 views .",
      "Hillesum has repeatedly been referred to as a mystic .",
      "Richard Layard has spoken with great appreciation of Hillesums view that one must preserve ones inner self , or core .",
      "Rowan Rheingans has drawn on Hillesums writing , particularly on the coexistence of beauty and horror , and on allowing room for sorrow , in her album The lines we draw together .",
      "The diaries .",
      "Before she left for Westerbork , Etty Hillesum gave her diaries to Maria Tuinzing , with the instruction they be passed to Klaas Smelik for publication , should she not survive . Attempts to have them published proved fruitless until 1979 , when Smeliks son , the director of the Etty Hillesum Research Centre , approached publisher J . G . Gaarlandt . An abridged edition of her diaries appeared in 1981 under the title Het verstoorde leven [ An Interrupted Life ] , followed by a collection of her letters from Westerbork . A complete edition of her letters and diaries was published in Dutch in 1986 and translated into English in 2002 . Her diaries were translated into 18 languages . Her letters were sent to friends and Hillesum\u2019s final postcard was thrown from the train in Westerbork , where it was discovered by Dutch farmers after her death .",

      "Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp n\u00e9e Hermine Luise Berkenkamp ( 15 May 1901 \u2013 11 April 1976 ) was a German painter , colour designer , the avant-garde author of childrens books , fairy-tale illustrator and costume designer .",
      "Early life .",
      "Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp was born in Wesel and was the daughter of Adalbert Berkenkamp ( 1868-1947 ) and his wife Laura Johanna Katharina Darmst\u00e4dter ( 1872-1956 ) . She had two brothers Alfred ( 1896-1917 ) and Walter ( 1910-1994 ) . Her father and her uncle Heinrich , managed the paper and paper bag factory in Wesel which had been founded by her grandfather Heinrich Berkenkamp in 1865 .",
      "Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp graduated from elementary school , then attended a grammar school for four years and went on to attend the Viktoria-Schule in Essen , a girls grammar school with progressive teaching . Through the art teacher Margarete Schall ( 1896-1939 ) her talent for colours and painting was discovered . Hermine Louise Berkenkamp originally wanted to study medicine or German philologie . But Margarete Schall , who herself later enrolled in the Bauhaus for a semester , suggested she study at the art school as it was known for its progressive teaching methods .",
      "The Bauhaus period .",
      "After graduating from high school in 1920 , Lou Berkenkamp enrolled at the Bauhaus in Weimar and studied under Johannes Itten , Lyonel Feininger , Paul Klee and Georg Muche . She became acquainted with Hinnerk Scheper , a classmate in the mural painting workshop there and married him on December 24 , 1922 in Weimar . Berkenkamp lived with her parents in Wesel during the first years of her marriage , with their son Jan Gisbert , born in November 1923 . During this time the first pictures letters were created .",
      "In 1922 the couple left the Bauhaus Weimar and while Lou focused on her artistic work , Hinnerk Scheper worked as a colour designer . In 1925 , he was called to the Bauhaus in Dessau as a master of the mural painting workshop at the Bauhaus Dessau . In 1926 their daughter Britta was born in Dessau . After Georg Muche , master woodcarver , left for Berlin in 1927 , a semi-detached house became available and the Scheper family was able to move in . Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp worked - without matriculation - in the stage workshop of the Bauhaus under the direction of Oskar Schlemmer . Lou supported an important area of Schlemmers work with the development of costumes , choreographies , sets and puppets for Triadisches Ballett , premiere 1922 in Stuttgart , further developed by Oskar Schlemmer in 1926 with music by Hindemith . She designed and directed costumes and sets for the plays Ojdar\u201c and Circus and directed . In the group exhibition Junge Bauhausmaler ( Young Bauhaus Painter ) , in Halle ( Saale ) , she took 1928 part . She also created also a number of childrens books until the couples 1929 departure from Dessau . Family Scheper remained associated with the Bauhaus until its closure in 1933 and beyond .",
      "Moscow 1929 to 1931 .",
      "From July 1929 to August 1930 the Schepers followed a call to Moscow . Hinnerk Scheper , a specialist in colour design , was to set up a Consultation Centre for Colour in Architecture and Cityscapes ( Russian Maljarstroj ) for the entire Soviet Union . Together they worked on the colour plans . During this time Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp wrote articles for the German-language weekly Moskauer Rundschau ( Moscow Review ) In her contributions she captured the everyday life of people in the big city with an artistic hand and in a socially critical manner . In the service of her husband , she did not publish her own works in Moscow and supported Hinnerk in organizational problems . Inspired by the figures of the Triadic Ballet , she created collages of the basic forms circle , triangle and square . With her abstract work she critically opposed the standardization of architecture and the Soviet citizens . She painted Moscows street life with ink and opaque colours . This resulted in ironic text and skillful picture designs .",
      "The National Socialism period .",
      "After another shorter stay in Moscow in 1931 , the Schepers returned to the Bauhaus in Dessau under the new director Ludwig Mies van der Rohe . When the Bauhaus moved in 1932 , they also moved to the capital Berlin .",
      "Due to the worsening political situation in Germany in 1932 , further cooperation with Soviet colleagues was no longer conceivable . The right-wing magistrate in Dessau , the leading faction in the city council since 1931 , cut all funding for the Bauhaus . On October 1 , 1932 , the Bauhaus Dessau closed down involuntarily and under high political pressure . The building was used as the Gauf\u00fchrerschule of the NSDAP . Mies van der Rohe wanted to continue the Bauhaus in Berlin with his own funds under the title Free Teaching and Research Institute in the former Steglitz telephone factory , but the fascists forced him to close the institute on 20 July 1933 . From then on , the teachers had to secure their livelihood with casual jobs . Some Bauhaus artists emigrated to Palestine and the USA .",
      "Since the closure of the Bauhaus in 1933 , Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp worked as a freelance painter in Berlin . Between 1933 and 1945 , Scheper-Berkenkamp designed a number of childrens books , many of which were published following the Second World War by the publisher Ernst Wunderlich , Leipzig . Her son Dirk was born in Berlin in 1938 . Lou accompanied Hinnerk on his Norddeutsche Reportage-Reisen and wrote texts for his various landscape photo series of landscapes . Repressions in 1934 against her husband Hinnerk , who was forbidden by the Nazis to join the Reich Association of German Photojournalists , also cut off this source of income for the family . So they concentrated on the colour design of public houses , murals and restoration work . Hinnerk Scheper did military service in Germany from 1942 to 1945 . During this time , Lou provided for the family alone . She invented picture stories , which were not published as childrens books until by Ernst Wunderlich Verlag in Leipzig . The family survived the war years in complete seclusion .",
      "After World War II .",
      "Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp and her children Britta , Jan Giesbert , Dirk and her parents , whose house in Wesel was destroyed by the war , had experienced the end of the war in Badbergen .",
      "In 1945 the Berlin magistrate appointed Hinnerk Scheper as a monument conservator and state curator of Berlin and his wife supported him in his work . From now on she devoted herself again to her artistic work and looked for a way to publish childrens books . In the publisher Ernst Wunderlich from Leipzig she found the right contact person , with the best technical possibilities of offset printing and a great supporter .",
      "In 1950/51 she took part in exhibitions of picture book originals . Her works were shown in America Houses in Kassel , Darmstadt , Frankfurt , Gie\u00dfen , Marburg and Wiesbaden . These American institutions were established around 1950 in West Germany in the spirit of democratic educational work by the Allies . In the open , democratic and friendly atmosphere of these houses , Lous timelessly artistic picture stories were able to unfold the narrative stream flow of their art .",

      "Tingmissartoq",
      "Tingmissartoq was the name given to a Lockheed Model 8 Sirius flown by Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh in the 1930s . Tingmissartoq means one who flies like a big bird ; the plane was thus christened by an Inuit boy in Godthaab ( Nuuk ) , Greenland , who painted the word on its side .",
      "First flight .",
      "Lockheed had introduced its Sirius model in 1929 ; this particular craft appears to have been built to specifications sometime between then and 1931 , when the Lindberghs planned to fly to the Orient via the Great Circle Route . A low-wing monoplane , Tingmissartoq was outfitted with Edo floats , as much of the planned route was over water .",
      "The trip was described solely as a vacation flight , with no start or finish , no diplomatic or commercial significance , and no records to be sought . It began in North Haven , Maine , from which point the couple flew to Ottawa . From there they flew to various other sites in Canada , including Moose Factory , Churchill , Baker Lake , and Aklavik , before heading to Point Barrow , Alaska . They continued on to Shismaref and Nome , after which they crossed the Pacific Ocean to Petropavlosk . From here they continued over the Kuril Islands to Tokyo , where they were enthusiastically welcomed . The trip continued on to China , with its final stop on Lotus Lake near Nanking made on September 19 .",
      "Anne Morrow Lindbergh described the trip , and her impressions and experiences , in her book North to the Orient .",
      "Accident at Hankow .",
      "While at Hankow , the plane , with the Lindberghs aboard , was being lowered into the Yangtze River from the British aircraft carrier when it capsized accidentally . One wing hit a ships cable and was damaged , necessitating the crafts return to the United States for repairs .",
      "Second journey .",
      "Tingmissartoq was to see action again in 1933 as a result of international interest in the development of commercial air transport . Pan American Airways , Imperial Airways , Deutsche Luft Hansa , KLM , and Air France collaborated on a study of international air routes . The assigned areas were Newfoundland to Europe via Greenland ; Newfoundland via the great circle route to Ireland ; Newfoundland southeast to the Azores and Lisbon ; Miami , Bermuda , the Azores , and Lisbon ; and across the South Atlantic from Brazil , to Cape Verde . Pan American was given the responsibility for the first of these , and sent Lindbergh , as the companys technical advisor , to survey the route . Accompanied once more by Anne , he took off from New York City on July 9 in the rebuilt craft . The purpose of the trip was to gain as much data as possible on the area to be covered .",
      "The plane had been fitted with a Sperry artificial horizon and a directional gyro since its previous flight . The engine , too , was new , a Wright Cyclone SR1820-F2 of 710 hp . All possible spaces were used , including the wings and floats ; these contained the gasoline tanks . There was also plenty of emergency equipment for use in the event of a forced landing .",
      "To maintain radio contact with the couple , Pan American hired a Danish ship , the Jellinge , to stay within range in the area of Labrador , Greenland , and Iceland . It also delivered advance supplies for them to Halifax , St . Johns , Cartwright , Greenland , and Iceland .",
      "Tingmissartoq flew first from New York to Hopedale , Labrador , hugging the eastern Canada\u2013US border along the way . From here the Lindberghs made the first major hop over water , flying 650 miles to Godthaab . The couple then crisscrossed Greenland to Baffin Island and back , and then flew to Iceland . They continued the trip by flying around the world ; visiting first the major cities of Europe , they continued to Moscow , then down Africas west coast , and across the South Atlantic to South America . Here , they flew down the Amazon River , and then turned north through Trinidad and Barbados before returning to the United States . They returned to New York on December 19 , having traveled 30,000 miles and visited four continents and twenty-one countries . The information they provided proved invaluable in planning transatlantic air transport routes .",
      "Tingmissartoq was on display in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City until 1955 , when it was acquired by the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton , Ohio . It was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959 , and is currently on display in the Pioneers of Flight gallery of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC .",

      "Siemens AG ( ) is a German multinational conglomerate company headquartered in Munich and the largest industrial manufacturing company in Europe with branch offices abroad .",
      "The principal divisions of the company are Industry , Energy , Healthcare ( Siemens Healthineers ) , and Infrastructure & Cities , which represent the main activities of the company . The company is a prominent maker of medical diagnostics equipment and its medical health-care division , which generates about 12 percent of the companys total sales , is its second-most profitable unit , after the industrial automation division . The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index . Siemens and its subsidiaries employ approximately 385,000 people worldwide and reported global revenue of around \u20ac87 billion in 2019 according to its earnings release .",
      "History .",
      "1847 to 1901 .",
      "Siemens & Halske was founded by Werner von Siemens and Johann Georg Halske on 1 October 1847 . Based on the telegraph , their invention used a needle to point to the sequence of letters , instead of using Morse code . The company , then called Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens & Halske , opened its first workshop on 12 October .",
      "In 1848 , the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe ; 500 km from Berlin to Frankfurt am Main . In 1850 , the founders younger brother , Carl Wilhelm Siemens , later Sir William Siemens , started to represent the company in London . The London agency became a branch office in 1858 . In the 1850s , the company was involved in building long-distance telegraph networks in Russia . In 1855 , a company branch headed by another brother , Carl Heinrich von Siemens , opened in St Petersburg , Russia . In 1867 , Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European telegraph line stretching over 11,000 km from London to Calcutta .",
      "In 1867 , Werner von Siemens described a dynamo without permanent magnets . A similar system was also independently invented by \u00c1nyos Jedlik and Charles Wheatstone , but Siemens became the first company to build such devices . In 1881 , a Siemens AC Alternator driven by a watermill was used to power the worlds first electric street lighting in the town of Godalming , United Kingdom . The company continued to grow and diversified into electric trains and light bulbs . In 1887 , it opened its first office in Japan . In 1890 , the founder retired and left the running of the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm .",
      "1901 to 1933 .",
      "Siemens & Halske ( S & H ) was incorporated in 1897 , and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert & Co. , Nuremberg in 1903 to become Siemens-Schuckert . In 1907 , Siemens ( Siemens & Halske and Siemens-Schuckert ) had 34,324 employees and was the seventh-largest company in the German empire by number of employees . ( see List of German companies by employees in 1907 )",
      "In 1919 , S & H and two other companies jointly formed the Osram lightbulb company .",
      "During the 1920s and 1930s , S & H started to manufacture radios , television sets , and electron microscopes .",
      "In 1932 , ( Erlangen ) , Ph\u00f6nix AG ( Rudolstadt ) and Siemens-Reiniger-Veifa mbH ( Berlin ) merged to form the Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG ( SRW ) , the third of the so-called parent companies that merged in 1966 to form the present-day Siemens AG .",
      "In the 1920s , Siemens constructed the Ardnacrusha Hydro Power station on the River Shannon in the then Irish Free State , and it was a world first for its design . The company is remembered for its desire to raise the wages of its under-paid workers only to be overruled by the Cumann na nGaedheal government .",
      "1933 to 1945 .",
      "Siemens ( at the time : Siemens-Schuckert ) exploited the forced labour of deported people in extermination camps . The company owned a plant in Auschwitz concentration camp .",
      "Siemens exploited the forced labour of women in the concentration camp of Ravensbr\u00fcck . The factory was located in front of the camp .",
      "During the final years of World War II , numerous plants and factories in Berlin and other major cities were destroyed by Allied air raids . To prevent further losses , manufacturing was therefore moved to alternative places and regions not affected by the air war . The goal was to secure continued production of important war-related and everyday goods . According to records , Siemens was operating almost 400 alternative or relocated manufacturing plants at the end of 1944 and in early 1945 .",
      "In 1972 , Siemens sued German satirist F.C . Delius for his satirical history of the company , Unsere Siemenswelt , and it was determined much of the book contained false claims although the trial itself publicized Siemens history in Nazi Germany . The company supplied electrical parts to Nazi concentration camps and death camps . The factories had poor working conditions , where malnutrition and death were common . Also , the scholarship has shown that the camp factories were created , run , and supplied by the SS , in conjunction with company officials , sometimes high-level officials .",
      "1945 to 2001 .",
      "In the 1950s , and from their new base in Bavaria , S&H started to manufacture computers , semiconductor devices , washing machines , and pacemakers . In 1966 , Siemens & Halske ( S&H , founded in 1847 ) , Siemens-Schuckertwerke ( SSW , founded in 1903 ) and Siemens-Reiniger-Werke ( SRW , founded in 1932 ) merged to form Siemens AG . In 1969 , Siemens formed Kraftwerk Union with AEG by pooling their nuclear power businesses .",
      "The companys first digital telephone exchange was produced in 1980 . In 1988 , Siemens and GEC acquired the UK defence and technology company Plessey . Plesseys holdings were split , and Siemens took over the avionics , radar and traffic control businesses\u2014as Siemens Plessey .",
      "In 1977 , Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) entered into a joint venture with Siemens , which wanted to enhance its technology expertise and enter the American market . Siemens purchased 20% of AMDs stock , giving the company an infusion of cash to increase its product lines . The two companies also jointly established Advanced Micro Computers ( AMC ) , located in Silicon Valley and in Germany , allowing AMD to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field , in particular based on AMDs second-source Zilog Z8000 microprocessors . When the two companies vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged , AMD bought out Siemens stake in the American division in 1979 . AMD closed Advanced Micro Computers in late 1981 after switching focus to manufacturing second-source Intel x86 microprocessors .",
      "In 1985 , Siemens bought Allis-Chalmers interest in the partnership company Siemens-Allis ( formed 1978 ) which supplied electrical control equipment . It was incorporated into Siemens Energy and Automation division .",
      "In 1987 , Siemens reintegrated Kraftwerk Union , the unit overseeing nuclear power business .",
      "In 1989 , Siemens bought the solar photovoltaic business , including 3 solar module manufacturing plants , from industry pioneer ARCO Solar , owned by oil firm ARCO .",
      "In 1991 , Siemens acquired Nixdorf Computer AG and renamed it Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG , in order to produce personal computers .",
      "In October 1991 , Siemens acquired the Industrial Systems Division of Texas Instruments , Inc , based in Johnson City , Tennessee . This division was organized as Siemens Industrial Automation , Inc. , and was later absorbed by Siemens Energy and Automation , Inc .",
      "In 1992 , Siemens bought out IBMs half of ROLM ( Siemens had bought into ROLM five years earlier ) , thus creating SiemensROLM Communications ; eventually dropping ROLM from the name later in the 1990s .",
      "In 1993\u20131994 , Siemens C651 electric trains for Singapores Mass Rapid Transit ( MRT ) system were built in Austria .",
      "In 1997 , Siemens agreed to sell the defence arm of Siemens Plessey to British Aerospace ( BAe ) and a German aerospace company , DaimlerChrysler Aerospace . BAe and DASA acquired the British and German divisions of the operation respectively .",
      "In October 1997 , Siemens Financial Services ( SFS ) was founded to act as a competence center for financing issues and as a manager of financial risks within Siemens .",
      "In 1998 , Siemens acquired Westinghouse Power Generation for more than $1.5 billion from the CBS Corporation and moving Siemens from third to second in the world power generation market .",
      "In 1999 , Siemens semiconductor operations were spun off into a new company called Infineon Technologies . Its Electromechanical Components operations were converted into a legally independent company : Siemens Electromechanical Components GmbH & Co .

      "2005 and continuing : worldwide bribery scandal .",
      "Beginning in 2005 , Siemens became embroiled in a multi-national bribery scandal . One component of this scandal was the Siemens Greek bribery scandal over deals between Siemens and Greek government officials during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games . Siemens activities came under legal scrutiny when complaints from prosecutors in Italy , Liechtenstein and Switzerland lead to German authorities opening investigations , followed by a US investigation in 2006 concerning their activities while listed on US stock exchanges . The investigators found that bribing officials to win contracts was standard operating procedure . Over that time period the company paid around $1.3 billion in bribes in many countries and kept separate books to hide them . Settlement negotiations took place through most of 2008 with settlement terms announced in December 2008 . The company paid a total of about $1.6 billion , around $800 million in each of the US and Germany . This was the largest bribery fine in history , at the time . The company was also obligated to spend $1 billion on setting up and funding new internal compliance regimens . Siemens pleaded guilty to violating accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ; the parent company did not plead guilty to paying bribes ( although its Bangladesh and Venezuela subsidiaries did ) .",
      "In 2005 Germany opened investigations into Siemens business practices worldwide , prompted by requests from prosecutors in Italy , Liechtenstein and Switzerland ; US investigators joined in 2006 and the US investigators addressed violations only since 2001 , when Siemens started selling shares in a US stock exchange . The investigators found that bribing officials to win contracts was standard operating procedure . Over that time period the company paid around $1.3 billion in bribes in many countries and kept separate books to hide them .",
      "Fines were anticipated to be as high as $5 billion as the investigation unfolded . Settlement negotiations took place through most of 2008 and when they were announced in December they were far less , driven in part by Siemens cooperation , in part by the imminent change in US administrations ( the Obama administration was about to take over from the Bush administration ) , and in part by the dependence of the US military on Siemens as a contractor .",
      "The company paid a total of about $1.6 billion , around $800 million in each of the US and Germany . This was the largest bribery fine in history , at the time . The money paid to Germany included a $270 million fine paid the year before ( related to bribes in Nigeria ) . The US payment included $450 million in fines and penalties and a forfeiture of $350 million in profits . The company was also obligated to spend $1 billion on setting up and funding new internal compliance regimens . Siemens pleaded guilty to violating accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ; the parent company did not plead guilty to paying bribes ( although its Bangladesh and Venezuela subsidiaries did ) ; such a guilty plea would have barred Siemens from contracting for the US government . As the scandal had started breaking , Siemens had fired its chairman and CEO Heinrich von Pierer , and had hired its first non-German CEO , Peter L\u00f6scher ; it also had appointed a US lawyer , Peter Solmssen as an independent director to its board , in charge of compliance , and had accepted oversight of Theo Waigel , a former German finance minister , as a compliance monitor . The compliance overhaul eventually entailed hiring around 500 full-time compliance personnel worldwide . Siemens also enacted a series of new anti-corruption compliance policies , including a new anti-corruption handbook , web-based tools for due diligence and compliance , a confidential communications channel for employees to report irregular business practices , and a corporate disciplinary committee to impose appropriate disciplinary measures for substantiated misconduct .",
      "The culture of bribery was old in Siemens , and led to the 1914 scandal in Japan over bribes paid by both Siemens and Vickers to Japanese naval authorities to win shipbuilding contracts .",
      "The culture of bribery had further had grown up inside Siemens after World War II as Siemens attempted to rebuild its business by competing in the developing world , where bribery is common . Until 1999 in Germany , bribes were a tax-deductible business expense , and there were no penalties for bribing foreign officials . In 1999 the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention came into effect , to which Germany was a party , and Siemens started to use off-shore accounts and other means of hiding its bribery .",
      "As the investigation opened a midlevel executive in the telecommunications unit , Reinhard Slekaczek , was identified as a key player ; Slekaczek quit Siemens in 2005 after the company required him to sign a document saying he had followed law and company policy , and turned states evidence and led investigators to documents he had saved and to other documents . He had controlled an annual global bribery budget of $40 to $50 million . The usual method of bribery was to pay a local insider as a contractor who would in turn pass money to government officials ; as part of the settlement Siemens disclosed that it had 2,700 such contractors worldwide . Bribes were generally around 5% of a contracts value but in very corrupt countries they could be as high as 40% . It paid the highest bribes in Argentina , Israel , Venezuela , China , Nigeria , and Russia .",
      "Examples of bribery the investigation found included :",
      "- $40 million in bribes in Argentina to win a $1 billion contract to make national identity cards .",

      "- $5 million in Bangladesh for mobile phones",

      "The investigation led directly to several prosecutions while it was unfolding , and led to settlements with other governments and prosecution of Siemens employees and bribe recipients in various countries .",
      "In May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about \u20ac6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win natural gas turbine supply contracts with Enel , an Italian energy company . The contracts were valued at about \u20ac450 million . Siemens was fined \u20ac38 million .",
      "In July 2009 , Siemens settled allegations of fraud by a Russian affiliate in a World Bank-funded mass transit project in Moscow by agreeing to not bid on World Bank projects for two years , not allowing the Russian affiliate to do any World Bank funded work for four years , and setting up a $100 million fund at the World Bank to fund anti-corruption activities over 15 years , over which the World Bank had veto and audit rights ; this fund became the Siemens Integrity Initiative . The first payments were made out of the funds in 2010 in a tranche of $40 million . A second set of projects was funded in 2014 totaling $30 million .",

      "S\u00e9rgio Paulo Marceneiro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o ( ; born 15 November 1974 ) is a Portuguese professional football manager and former player who mostly played as a right winger . He is the current manager of Porto .",
      "Throughout his career , he played for ten teams in five countries . After gaining international recognition with Porto he switched to Italy , where he appeared for three clubs . He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 97 games and 13 goals over four seasons , adding 136 matches and 13 goals in Serie A .",
      "Having won more than 50 caps for Portugal , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o represented the nation in one World Cup and one European Championship . In 2012 , he started working as a manager , winning two league titles for Porto and the double in 2019\u201320 .",
      "Playing career .",
      "Club .",
      "Born in Coimbra , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o began his career playing for the youth teams of hometowns Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica . He started professionally in the second division , consecutively for F.C . Penafiel , Le\u00e7a F.C . and F.C . Felgueiras , before moving to FC Porto in 1996 ; two highly successful years with the latter saw his runs down the right flank , combined with a good goalscoring record , help it to back-to-back Primeira Liga championships and a Ta\u00e7a de Portugal triumph .",
      "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o joined S.S . Lazio and played a significant part in their 1998\u201399 UEFA Cup Winners Cup success , while also scoring five goals in 33 games in his first season in Serie A . He also helped the team to a Scudetto , a Coppa Italia ( in a 1999\u20132000 conquest of the double ) and the 1999 UEFA Super Cup .",
      "In July 2000 , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o transferred to Parma A.C . as a makeweight in Hern\u00e1n Crespos transfer , along with Mat\u00edas Almeyda . The following campaign , he was used in the same fashion in the transfer of S\u00e9bastien Frey , which saw him go to Inter Milan while Frey went in the other direction . After two seasons and a good number of starts , he would eventually leave Inter by mutual agreement and re-joined Lazio , leaving for former club Porto towards the end of 2003\u201304 , again by mutual agreement , and adding his third Portuguese national championship .",
      "In summer 2004 , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o signed for Belgiums Standard Li\u00e8ge on a one-year deal . He won the Belgian Golden Shoe for best player of the year in his first season . However , in March 2006 , he was banned for three years \u2013 the first 4.5 months of the ban taking effect immediately and the rest suspended\u2013 depending on good behaviour , for spitting on an opposing player and assaulting a referee .",
      "After the 2006\u201307 season , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o failed to win any silverware with Standard , finishing runner-up in 2005\u201306s league and losing the 2007 final of the Belgian Cup . He decided to move to Kuwait and Qadsia SC on an annual salary of \u20ac1.1 million but , quickly unsettled , left .",
      "In January 2008 , after failed deals in Portugal , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o agreed to join PAOK FC in Greece , signing an 18-month contract . His unlikely signing was largely attributed to club director of football Zisis Vryzas , and the presence of Portuguese manager Fernando Santos on the bench ; though he initially struggled even to return to proper fitness levels , he was instantly given the number No . 7 shirt , once worn by legendary former player ( and also chairman ) Theodoros Zagorakis .",
      "In 2008\u201309 , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was promoted to team captain . Along with compatriot Vieirinha , he was a regular on the teams wings and gradually became a fan favourite for his leadership and his devotion to the club ; at the beginning of the following campaign , however , he was regularly troubled by knee injuries for the most part of October , managing only a few appearances .",
      "International .",
      "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o played 56 times with the Portugal national team and scored 12 goals , his debut being on 9 November 1996 in a 1\u20130 home win against Ukraine for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers . In his last international game he was on the losing end of a 0\u20133 friendly defeat at the hands of Spain , on 6 September 2003 .",
      "Early in his international career , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was not known for his scoring prowess but , at UEFA Euro 2000 , Portugal reached the semi-finals with a major contribution from him : in the third and final match of the group stage , against defending champions Germany in Rotterdam , he netted a hat-trick for all of the games goals ; the national side had guaranteed first place in the first two rounds , so it played mostly with substitutes , but he cemented his place in the starting XI for the rest of the tournament and subsequent call-ups .",
      "In qualifying for the 2002 World Cup , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o scored four goals as Portugal finished atop a group that also featured the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands ( netting against both ) . He was not recalled after 2003 .",
      "Coaching career .",
      "Beginnings .",
      "On 13 October 2009 , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o announced his decision to retire as a professional footballer , and to continue working at PAOK as technical director , accepting Vryzas proposal for the seat left vacant when he assumed presidency early on . On 30 May 2010 , a few weeks after Santos resignation as manager , he left the Thessaloniki club and rejoined another former team , as part of Standard Li\u00e8ges coaching staff led by Dominique DOnofrio .",
      "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o began his managerial career on 1 January 2012 , replacing Da\u00fato Faquir\u00e1 at the helm of S.C . Olhanense in Primeira Liga . He left the Algarve side on 9 August , following disputes with the board .",
      "On 8 April 2013 , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was hired as manager of his hometown team Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra , less than 24 hours after the club dismissed Pedro Emanuel from the job . They stood at 13th place when he joined , and his main goal was to avoid relegation . He left at the end of the season , after leading the side to an eighth place finish .",
      "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o signed a two-year contract with S.C . Braga on 26 May 2014 ; the team had just finished the campaign one place below Acad\u00e9mica with the same number of points , resulting in the first time in ten years that Braga was out of European competitions . He led them to a fourth place finish and to the final of the domestic cup . After the semi-final victory at Rio Ave FCs ground , he made the 24-mile journey home from Vila do Conde on foot as part of a bet made with his players . Braga lost the final in a penalty shootout to Sporting CP despite leading 2\u20130 at half time . Following this defeat , president Ant\u00f3nio Salvador released an official statement that angered the manager , resulting in a violent discussion between the two and leading to the clubs decision of sacking the latter .",
      "On 22 September 2015 , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o resurfaced with his fourth management position in the Portuguese top-flight , at Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es . On 17 January 2016 , he led the side to their first home win against FC Porto ( 1\u20130 ) in 14 years . He left at the end of the campaign , by mutual consent with the club , after a 10th place in the championship left them out of European competitions .",
      "Nantes .",
      "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was named manager of Ligue 1 club FC Nantes on 8 December 2016 , replacing the dismissed Ren\u00e9 Girard at a side second from bottom . The following February , he was linked to the vacant managerial position at struggling Premier League title holders Leicester City , but Nantes chairman Waldemar Kita insisted he would see out his two-year contract .",
      "On 6 June 2017 , it was announced that Concei\u00e7\u00e3o had quit his position and accepted a proposal from Porto . The manager cited personal reasons , including the possibility to live close to his family in Portugal , as to why he accepted the Portuguese clubs proposal .",
      "Porto .",
      "In June 2017 , after cutting ties with the French club , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o replaced former teammate Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo at the helm of former side Porto . He was officially presented on the 8th , signing a two-year deal . In his first season , he led the club to the national championship after a five-year wait , and his contract was extended by another year . They reached the quarter-finals in the subsequent UEFA Champions League , where they were ousted by eventual winners Liverpool .",
      "On 1 March 2019 , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o signed another deal to stay at Porto until 2021 . They regained their title in 2019\u201320 with two games to spare , after S.L . Benficas form worsened at the end of the campaign . Two weeks later , his team beat that opponent in the cup final to secure the double . The side again reached the last-eight in the Champions League , being defeated 2\u20131 on aggregate by Chelsea .",
      "Style of play .",
      "A talented player , Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was mainly known for his speed , strength , and ability to cover the flank and get forward , also possessing good dribbling skills , crossing ability , and a fairly accurate shot . A versatile and hard-working midfielder , although he was usually deployed as a right winger , he was also capable of playing in a holding role .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Coimbras municipal government named a local 2,500-seater stadium after him \u2013 the Est\u00e1dio Municipal S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o . He fathered five sons : S\u00e9rgio , Rodrigo , Mois\u00e9s , Francisco and Jos\u00e9 .",
      "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o helped ten families who were struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic , with the intent of providing a grocery store in every home . During an interview to RTP1 in December 2020 , he stated that his idol was God and he was a devout Catholic .",

      "Boris Nemtsov",
      "Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov ( ; 9 October 195927 February 2015 ) was a Russian physicist and liberal politician . Nemtsov was one of the most important figures in the introduction of reforms into the Russian post-Soviet economy . He had a successful political career in the 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin . From 2000 until his death , he was an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin . Nemtsov was assassinated on 27 February 2015 , beside his Ukrainian partner Anna Durytska , on a bridge near the Kremlin in Moscow , with four shots fired from the back . In the weeks before his death , Nemtsov expressed fear that Putin would have him killed . In late June 2017 , five Chechnya-born men were found guilty by a jury in a Moscow court for agreeing to kill Nemtsov in exchange for 15 million rubles ( US$253,000 ) ; neither the identity nor whereabouts of the person who hired them is officially known .",
      "Nemtsov criticized Putins government as an increasingly authoritarian , undemocratic regime , highlighting widespread embezzlement and profiteering ahead of the Sochi Olympics , and Russian political interference and military involvement in Ukraine . After 2008 , Nemtsov published in-depth reports detailing the corruption under Putin , which he connected directly with the President . As part of the same political struggle , Nemtsov was an active organizer of and participant in Dissenters Marches , Strategy-31 civil actions and rallies For Fair Elections .",
      "At the time of the assassination , Nemtsov was in Moscow helping to organize a rally against the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the Russian financial crisis . At the same time , Nemtsov was working on a report demonstrating that Russian troops were fighting alongside pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine , which the Kremlin had been denying , and was unpopular externally but also in Russia .",
      "Nemtsov was the first governor of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast ( 1991\u201397 ) . Later he worked in the government of Russia as Minister of Fuel and Energy ( 1997 ) , Vice Premier of Russia and Security Council member from 1997 to 1998 . In 1998 , he founded the Young Russia movement . In 1998 , he co-founded the coalition group Right Cause and in 1999 , he co-formed Union of Right Forces , an electoral bloc and subsequently a political party . Nemtsov was also a member of the Congress of Peoples Deputies ( 1990 ) , Federation Council ( 1993\u201397 ) and State Duma ( 1999\u20132003 ) .",
      "He also served as Vice Speaker of the State Duma and the leader of parliamentary group Union of Right Forces . After a 2008 split in the Union of Right Forces , he co-founded Solidarnost . In 2010 , he co-formed the coalition For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption , which was refused registration as a party . Beginning in 2012 , Nemtsov was co-chair of the Republican Party of Russia \u2013 Peoples Freedom Party ( RPR-PARNAS ) , a registered political party .",
      "At the time of his death , Nemtsov was one of the leaders of the Solidarnost ( Solidarity ) opposition movement , an elected member of the regional parliament of Yaroslavl Oblast , and co-chair of the RPR-PARNAS , which is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats , a Pan-European political party .",
      "After Nemtsovs murder , Serge Schmemann of The New York Times paid tribute to him in an article headlined A Reformer Who Never Backed Down . Schmemann wrote : Tall , handsome , witty and irreverent , Mr . Nemtsov was one of the brilliant young men who burst onto the Russian stage at that exciting moment when Communist rule collapsed and a new era seemed imminent . Julia Ioffe of The New York Times described Nemtsov after his death as a powerful , vigorous critic of Vladimir Putin , who was a deeply intelligent , witty , kind and ubiquitous man who seemed to genuinely be everyones friend .",
      "Early life .",
      "Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov was born in Sochi in 1959 to Yefim Davidovich Nemtsov and Dina Yakovlevna Eidman . His mother , a physician , is Jewish .",
      "His parents divorced when he was five years old . In his autobiography , Nemtsov recounts that his Russian Orthodox paternal grandmother had him baptized as an infant , and that he became a practicing Orthodox Christian . He found out about his baptism many years later .",
      "Studies and academic career .",
      "From 1976 to 1981 , Nemtsov studied physics at N . I . Lobachevsky State University in the city of Gorky , receiving a degree in 1981 .",
      "Aged 25 in 1985 , he defended his dissertation for a PhD in Physics and Mathematics from the State University of Gorky . Until 1990 , he worked as a research fellow at the Radiophysical Research Institute , and produced more than 60 academic publications related to quantum physics , thermodynamics and acoustics .",
      "He proposed a theoretical model for an acoustic laser and a novel design of antennas for space probes .",
      "Political career , 1986\u20132004 .",
      "In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 , Nemtsov organized a protest movement in his hometown which effectively prevented construction of a nuclear-fired boiler plant in the region .",
      "In 1989 , Nemtsov unsuccessfully ran for the Soviet Congress of Peoples Deputies on a reform platform which for the time was quite radical , promoting ideas such as multiparty democracy and private enterprise .",
      "In Russias first free elections of 1990 , he ran for the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Republic representing Gorky , later renamed Nizhny Novgorod . Nemtsov was elected , the only non-communist candidate . He defeated twelve others . Once in Parliament he joined the Reform Coalition and Centre-Left political groups .",
      "In the Russian parliament , Nemtsov was on the legislative committee , working on agricultural reform and the liberalization of foreign trade . In this position he met Boris Yeltsin , who was impressed with his work . During the October 1991 attack on the government by Yeltsin opponents , Nemtsov vehemently supported the president and stood by him during the entire clash . After those events , Yeltsin rewarded Nemtsovs loyalty with the position of presidential representative in his home region of Nizhny Novgorod .",
      "In November 1991 , Yeltsin appointed him Governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region . He was re-elected to that position by popular vote in December 1995 . His tenure was marked by a wide-ranging , chaotic free market reform program nicknamed Laboratory of Reform for Nizhny Novgorod and resulted in significant economic growth for the region . Nemtsovs reforms won praise from former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who visited Nizhny Novgorod in 1993 .",
      "From the very outset of Nemtsovs tenure as governor , according to Serge Schmemann , Nemtsov embarked on a whirlwind campaign to transform the region , drawing enthusiastic support from a host of Western agencies . Although the province was closed to foreigners for years and there wasnt even enough paper money for the privatization program , he was optimistic about Moscows future and consequently pushed ahead on his own , even issuing his own money\u2014chits , to be eventually exchanged for rubles that came to be known as Nemtsovki . Nemtsov very openly looked to the West as a model for Russias future . Schmemann noted that Nemtsov adopted the westernized title Governor rather than the Russian Head of Administration .",
      "After Nemtsovs death , Leonid Bershidsky recalled meeting him in 1992 during his tenure as governor . A brilliant young physicist , recounted Bershidsky , he was trying to practice liberal economics in a gloomy Soviet-era industrial city that had long been off-limits to foreigners . Bershidsky described his eloquence and demeanor as that of a Hollywood movie politician transplanted into the Russian hinterland .",
      "In December 1993 , Nemtsov was elected to the Federation Council , the upper house of the Russian Parliament . During the election campaign he was backed by Russias Choice and Yabloko , which were then the principal liberal parties in the country .",
      "In 1996 , Nemtsov brought Yeltsin a petition with one million signatures against the first war in Chechnya , which he had signed himself .",
      "In March 1997 , Nemtsov was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation , with special responsibility for reform of the energy sector . He was tasked with restructuring the monopolies and reforming the housing and social sectors . He became widely popular with the public and appeared favoured to become President of Russia in 2000 . Boris Yeltsin introduced him to Bill Clinton as his chosen successor . In the summer of 1997 , opinion polls gave Nemtsov over 50% support as a potential presidential candidate . His political career , however , suffered a blow in August 1998 following the crash of the Russian stock-market and the ensuing economic crisis .",
      "Nemtsov had worked in Moscows White House for only a year and a half , although he stated he had some success . He ended the corrupt act of stashing budget funds in commercial banks . He also managed to introduce an anti-corruption law for all state purchases in the government . He also helped to end the illegal export of raw materials and made oil sales more transparent . And , most importantly , while I was the minister responsible for fuel and energy , oil was at barely 10 US dollars per barrel , and still we managed to save Russia . Things were difficult , what with social unrest , strikes , the war in Chechnya , the default , and still \u2013 let me repeat \u2013 we did save Russia .",
      "As part of Chubais economic team , Nemtsov was forced to resign his position of Deputy Prime Minister . After the dismissal of Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin in 1998 , Nemtsov was reappointed Deputy Prime Minister , but resigned shortly afterwards when Yeltsin dissolved the government . According to The Economist , Nemtsov , unlike many other top government figures , emerged from the troubled 1990s with his reputation intact .",
      "As early as 1998 , Nemtsov had a personal web site on RuNet . Nemtsov.ru sought to provide information to its users that was not available elsewhere and also was one of the first attempts by a politician to establish two-way communication with an audience .",
      "In August 1999 , Nemtsov became one of the co-founders of the Union of Right Forces , a then new liberal-democratic coalition which received nearly 6 million votes , or 8.6% of the vote , in the parliamentary elections in December 1999 . Nemtsov himself was elected to the State Duma , or lower house of Parliament , and became its Deputy Speaker in February 2000 . In May 2000 , Sergei Kiriyenko resigned and Nemtsov was elected leader of the party and its parliamentary group . Over 70% of delegates at the Union of Rightist Forces congress in May 2001 confirmed him as party leader . According to Nemtsov , the Union always consisted of two factions , a Nemtsov faction and a Chubais faction , with the former based on principles and ideology whereas the Chubais faction was pragmatic , existing by the rules of realpolitik .",
      "In 2002 , his name appeared on a list of several individuals the hostage-takers during the Moscow theater hostage crisis were willing to speak to directly . Nemtsov did not take part in the negotiations and later said that Putin had ordered him not to go .",
      "Between 2000 and 2003 , Nemtsov was in a difficult political position \u2013 while he vehemently believed President Vladimir Putins policies were rolling back democracy and civic freedoms in Russia , he needed to collaborate with the powerful co-chairman of the Union of Rightist Forces , Anatoly Chubais , who favoured a conciliatory line towards the Kremlin . In the parliamentary elections of December 2003 , the Union of Rightist Forces platform headed by both Nemtsov and Chubais received just 2.4 million votes , 4% of the total , and thus fell short of the 5% threshold necessary to enter Parliament and as a result lost its seats . In January 2004 , Nemtsov resigned from the party leadership . He became Chairman of the Council of Directors of Neftianoi , an oil company , and also a political advisor to Ukrainian president Viktor Yuschenko .",
      "Later career , 2004\u20132015 .",
      "In January 2004 , Nemtsov co-authored with his longtime adviser and party colleague Vladimir V . Kara-Murza an article in Nezavisimaya Gazeta entitled Appeal to the Putinist Majority , in which he warned of the danger of an impending Putin dictatorship . Later the same month , he co-founded Committee 2008 , an umbrella group of the Russian opposition which also included Garry Kasparov , Vladimir Bukovsky and other prominent liberals .",
      "In February 2004 , Nemtsov was appointed as a director of the Neftyanoi Bank , and as Chairman of Neftyanoi Concern , an oil firm and the banks parent company . In December 2005 , however , prosecutors announced an investigation of the bank following allegations of money laundering and fraud . Nemtsov subsequently stepped down from both his positions , saying that he wanted to minimize political fallout for the bank from his continuing involvement in Russian politics . Nemtsov also alleged that his bank perhaps was targeted because of his friendship and support of former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov , who had stated his intention to run for president in 2008 .",
      "During the 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections , Nemtsov came out as a strong supporter of the eventual winner Viktor Yushchenko , while the Russian government backed his opponent , Viktor Yanukovych . Shortly after the Orange Revolution , as the elections and series of protests in Ukraine came to be called , Yushchenko appointed Nemtsov as an economic adviser . Nemtsovs main goal was to improve business ties between Ukraine and Russia , damaged after the Putin government strongly supported Yushchenkos opponent in the presidential election . Yushchenkos selection of Nemtsov was controversial owing to Nemtsovs vocal criticism of Putin .",
      "The relationship between Nemtsov and the Ukrainian government became unstable in the middle of 2005 following accusations that Nemtsov had criticized Ukrainian cabinet decisions , and a group of legislators called for Yushchenko to fire Nemtsov . Despite the criticism , he remained as an economic adviser to Yushchenko until October 2006 , when the office of the Ukrainian president announced that Nemtsov had been relieved of his duties as a free lance presidential adviser .",
      "Nemtsov was briefly a candidate for the presidency of Russia in the 2008 election . On 26 December 2007 , Nemtsov withdrew his candidacy for the 2008 election , saying that he did not want to draw votes away from the other candidate of the democratic opposition , Mikhail Kasyanov . Nemtsov also had declared that he would no longer run , in part , due to his belief that the government had predetermined the elections winner .",
      "On 13 December 2008 , Nemtsov and Garry Kasparov co-founded the political opposition movement Solidarnost ( Solidarity ) . The organization hoped to unite the opposition forces in Russia . Nemtsov said in February 2011 that Solidarity had done everything it could to resolve conflicts within the opposition and that those who are trying to create a rift among the opposition , whether consciously or unconsciously , are helping Putin stay in power .",
      "At a Solidarnost meeting on 12 March 2009 , Nemtsov announced that he would run for mayor of Sochi in the citys 26 April election . As a Sochi native , he had criticized plans to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics in the town . He believed it was this criticism which led Nashi members to attack him with ammonium chloride on 23 March 2009 .",
      "In a March 2010 interview , Nemtsov criticized the decision to hold a Winter Olympics in Sochi , saying that Putin had found one of the only places in Russia where there is no snow in the winter . .. . Sochi is subtropical . There is no tradition of skating or hockey there . In Sochi , we prefer football , and volleyball , and swimming . Other parts of Russia need ice palaces\u2014we dont . The construction at the Olympics site was disastrous for the local economy , he added , saying that about 5,000 citizens had been removed from their homes to build Olympic facilities . He also added that thanks to the corruption and incompetence of authorities , [ these people have ] not yet been adequately compensated for their property or been given equivalent housing elsewhere , as they were promised . Billions of dollars have simply disappeared .",
      "On 27 April 2009 , it was announced that the acting Sochi mayor and United Russia candidate Anatoly Pakhomov had won the election with 77% of the vote . Nemtsov , who came second with around 14% of the vote , contested the fairness of the election , alleging that he was denied media access and that government workers had been pressured to vote for Pakhomov .",
      "Nemtsov was among the 34 original signatories of the online anti-Putin manifesto Putin must go , published on 10 March 2010 . Six months later , in September 2010 , together with Vladimir Ryzhkov , Mikhail Kasyanov and Vladimir Milov , Nemtsov formed the For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption party , which , three months later was transformed into the Peoples Freedom Party . In May 2011 , the party submitted an application for registration to the Ministry of Justice , but one month later it was denied .",
      "In response to the question Nemtsov , Milov and Ryzhkov and others , what do they really want ? in a live television broadcast on 16 December 2010 , Putin stated that during the 1990s they dragged a lot of billions along with Berezovsky and those who are now in prison.. . They have been pulled away from the manger , they had been spending heavily , and now they want to go back and fill their pockets . In January 2011 , Nemtsov , Milov and Ryzhkov brought suit over Putins statement before the Moscow City Court , but the following month the suit was dismissed . According to the judge , Tatiana Adamova , the names of Nemtsov , Milov and Ryzhkov were used merely as common names to refer to a certain class of politicians .",
      "In a May 2013 report , Nemtsov stated that up to $30 billion had been stolen from funds allocated for the Sochi Olympics . He accused the Putin administration of cronyism and embezzlement of funds on a level so grand it posed a threat to Russian national security . He suggested establishing a civic committee in charge of the investigation of the crimes committed around the Olympic project .",
      "Arrests in 2007 , 2010 , and 2011 .",
      "Nemtsov was arrested on 25 November 2007 during an unauthorized protest against President Putin near the State Hermitage Museum . Nemtsov and other opposition figures had complained of official harassment , and the police force had been used a number of times to break up what was then known as Dissenters Marches . Nemtsov was released later that day .",
      "On 31 December 2010 , he was arrested with other opposition leaders during a rally against government restrictions on public protests . He was sentenced on 2 January 2011 to 15 days in jail . The arrests were condemned by US Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman , and by Amnesty International , which described him as a prisoner of conscience . The Economist called his arrest a new low in the governance of Russia . The mistreatment of him seems pointlessly malevolent . .. . He poses no threat to the government . The rally was authorized and he was on his way home when the police stopped him . He was charged with disobeying the police and swearing , despite video-footage that showed him asking the police to calm down . A judge would not admit this as evidence . The court disregarded witness statements supporting him and would not let him appeal against his conviction .",
      "In a February 2011 interview , Nemtsov recalled that the cell in which he was imprisoned was a stone dungeon , about one and a half by three metres , veiled in semi-darkness so it was impossible to read . There was no bed , no pillows or mattresses , just the floor . He stated that his glasses , belt , and shoelaces were confiscated and he was given substandard living quarters . He attributed the decision to detain him to Vladislav Surkov , Deputy Chief of the Russian Presidents Administration and called it a political decision . Nemtsov filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights , which accepted it and agreed to handle the case through its new urgent procedure .",
      "During the 6 December 2011 protests in Moscow , Nemtsov was arrested with at least one hundred other demonstrators .",
      "Political views .",
      "After his dismissal from the government , Nemtsov became an important actor in the political discourse and eventually in the opposition to Putins government . Nemtsovs political beliefs have caused some to characterize him as a new liberal .",
      "In February 2011 , Nemtsov said : Everyone is unhappy with Putin , save perhaps his closest friends . He noted that for three consecutive years capital has been flowing out of the country , with some 40 billion dollars being taken out of the country in 2010 alone . As a result , even within his party of corrupt thieves there are not so many people willing to follow him until the very end .",
      "Nemtsov said :",
      "[ Putin had ] used the Moscow theatre siege to impose a regime of total censorship on TV ; he went on to destroy NTV , and then TV6 . He used the nightmare of Beslan to remove democratic elections of regional governors . In short , he drowned everyone apart from the terrorists .",
      "Nemtsov also stated :",
      "There is a myth spreading about how , in the 1990s , we democrats were pals with oligarchs while Putin was fighting them . It was exactly the other way around . We did not let Berezovsky get a foothold in [ the worlds largest natural gas company ] Gazprom , we did not allow him to take over the Svyazinvest company [ Russias largest telecom holding ] . Yet Putin used to go to his birthday parties and bring flowers to his wife . It was Berezovsky who lobbied for Putin to become president and then financed his campaign .",
      "Nemtsov told Newsweek in September 2011 that Putins decision to run for president again was predictable , but we were shocked by the hypocrisy and cynicism of the announcement : he declared he was coming back long before the elections . Putin and Medvedev did not even bother to share their decision to swap their chairs with the United Russia party before the congress . Russians had no choice but face his final decision ; his usurpation of political power is sickly humiliating . Nemtsov said that all of his friends in big business planned to take their capital out of Russia , while some prefer to emigrate .",
      "In a March 2012 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal , Nemtsov and Garry Kasparov expressed support for the repeal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment that impedes American trade relations with Russia . Nemtsov and Kasparov stated that at opposition meetings following the fraudulent March 4 election , they and their associates publicly resolved that Mr . Putin is not the legitimate leader of Russia . They explained that they wanted the U.S . and other leading nations of the Free World [ to ] cease to provide democratic credentials to Mr . Putin , and asked that the U.S . replace Jackson-Vanik with the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act and thus improve relations between the United States and the people of Russia all while refusing aid to the Putin regime .",
      "In December 2013 , Nemtsov said on behalf of his party :",
      "We support Ukraines course toward European integration [ ... ] By supporting Ukraine , we also support ourselves .",
      "Nemtsov condemned the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine :",
      "My condolences to the families of the victims . The bastards , who did this , must be destroyed . The separatists the other day bragged they had the Buk missiles , with which they wanted to take down an AN-26 . If those are them , they must get no mercy .",
      "Nemtsov was among the few Russian statesmen to vocally criticize the annexation of Crimea by Russia . Nemtsov stated that he viewed Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine , that he considered its annexation by the Russian Federation to be illegal , and that the people of Crimea and not Russian legislators should decide which country they want to live in . In an op-ed published on 1 September 2014 in the Kyiv Post , Nemtsov lamented the fratricidal war between Russia and Ukraine .",
      "This is not our war , this is not your war , this is not the war of 20-year-old paratroopers sent out there . This is Vladimir Putins war .",
      "He accused Putin of trying to dissect Ukraine and create in the east of the country a puppet state , Novorossiya , that is fully economically and politically controlled by the Kremlin . Meanwhile , wrote Nemtsov , Russia itself is sinking into lies , violence , obscurantism and imperial hysteria . He stated that he sometimes thinks Putin is insane , but at other times he recognizes that Putin is driven by one goal : the preservation of personal power and money at any cost . Ukraine had overthrown a thieving president , and Putin needed to punish it to make sure that no Russian would get these thoughts .",
      "Ukraine chose the European way , which implies the rule of law , democracy and change of power . Ukraines success on this way is a direct threat to Putins power because he chose the opposite course \u2013 a lifetime in power , filled with arbitrariness and corruption .",
      "He criticized Putin in 2014 :",
      "I cannot understand what Putin expects when he arms 20,000 Kadyrovites . Putin diligently finances Chechnya by sending there trains loaded with money . The republic receives a minimum of 60 billion rubles a year in grants . Only Allah knows how much money is being siphoned off through different programs , such as Northern Caucasus Resorts .",
      "In April 2014 , in an interview with journalists Boris Nemtsov called Putin a mental patient . This statement was used as the basis for initiation of criminal proceeding against Nemtsov but , eventually , the case was requalified to administrative offence .",
      "Assassination .",
      "Nemtsovs fears .",
      "Less than three weeks before his murder , on 10 February , Nemtsov had written on Russias Sobesednik news website that his 87-year-old mother was afraid Putin would kill him . He added that his mother is also afraid for former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny . When asked if he himself was afraid for his life , Nemtsov answered : Yes , not as strongly as my mother , but still.. . In an extended version of the interview , Nemtsov reportedly added : I am just joking . If I were afraid of Putin , I wouldnt be in this line of work .",
      "Two weeks prior to his assassination , Nemtsov had met with an old friend , Yevgenia Albats , editor of The New Times magazine , to discuss his research into Putins role in the Ukraine conflict . Albats said that Nemtsov was afraid of being killed , adding :",
      "And he was trying to convince himself , and me , they wouldnt touch him because he was a [ former ] member of the Russian government , a vice premier , and they wouldnt want to create a precedent . Because as he said , one time the power will change hands in Russia again , and those who served Putin wouldnt want to create this precedent .",
      "Assassination of Nemtsov ( 27 February 2015 ) .",
      "Just before midnight , at 23:31 local time on 27 February 2015 , Nemtsov was shot several times from behind . He was crossing the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow , close to the Kremlin walls and Red Square . He died at the scene . He was murdered less than two days before he was due to take part in a peace rally against Russian involvement in the war in Ukraine and the financial crisis in Russia .",
      "The BBC reported : In his last tweet , Mr . Nemtsov sent out an appeal for Russias divided opposition to unite at an anti-war march he was planning for Sunday . The BBC also quoted him as saying : If you support stopping Russias war with Ukraine , if you support stopping Putins aggression , come to the Spring March in Maryino on 1 March .",
      "The night after Nemtsovs murder , his papers , writings and computer hard drives were confiscated in a police search of his apartment on Malaya Ordynka street .",
      "Aftermath , context and accusations .",
      "Russian journalist Ksenia Sobchak said that Nemtsov had been preparing a report proving the presence of Russian military in eastern Ukraine despite its heated denial of any involvement there .",
      "Two weeks before his murder , Nemtsov had met with an old friend to discuss his latest research into what he said was dissembling and misdeeds in the Kremlin . Yevgenia Albats , editor of The New Times magazine , said that Nemtsov worked on a report which he planned to call Putin and the War , because it focused on Russias role in the Ukraine conflict . Albats commented on her fear for Nemtsovs life .",
      "Some people had accused Russian security services of responsibility for the crime . Vladimir Milov , a former deputy minister of energy and fellow opposition figure , said : There is ever less doubt that the state is behind the murder of Boris Nemtsov and stated that the objective had been to sow fear . Opposition activist Maksim Kats held Putin responsible : If he ordered it , then hes guilty as the orderer . And even if he didnt , then [ he is responsible ] as the inciter of hatred , hysteria , and anger among the people . Dmitry Peskov , a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin , told reporters : Putin noted that this cruel murder has all the hallmarks of a contract hit and is extremely provocative .",
      "Russian opposition leader and Nemtsovs ally Ilya Yashin claimed that Chechnyas leader Ramzan Kadyrov was behind the assassination of Nemtsov , saying that Chechnya today is a quasi-Islamic state within the Russian federation that does not obey Russian rules , and whose only connection with the federal authorities is the systematic receipt of money from the federal budget . Russian society stays silent because people are afraid of Kadyrov . And he exploits this fear as an instrument to muffle critics . Zhanna Nemtsova repeatedly said she wanted Kadyrov to be questioned about what he knew about the assassination of her father .",
      "Shortly after Nemtsovs murder , Julia Ioffe , a reporter , wrote that several theories about the crime had begun to circulate . Yet we can be sure that the investigation will lead precisely nowhere , she stated . At most , some sad sap , the supposed trigger-puller , will be hauled in front of a judge , the scapegoat for someone far more powerful . More likely , the case will founder for years amid promises that everyone is working hard , and no one will be brought to justice at all . Ioffe said that the Kremlin was already muddying the waters .",
      "LifeNews , a publication tied to Russias security agencies , had suggested three possible theories , namely that the killing was revenge for forcing Duritskaya to get an abortion , or that it had something to do with money Nemtsov was receiving from allies abroad , or that it was an attempt to smear the Kremlin . A statement by the governments Investigative Committee theorized that Nemtsov was killed by someone from his own opposition movement who wanted to create a martyr and even suggested that the assassination was connected to the Charlie Hebdo killings .",
      "After Nemtsovs murder , Serge Schmemann of The New York Times paid tribute to him in an article headlined A Reformer Who Never Backed Down . Schmemann wrote : Tall , handsome , witty and irreverent , Mr . Nemtsov was one of the brilliant young men who burst onto the Russian stage at that exciting moment when Communist rule collapsed and a new era seemed imminent . Julia Ioffe of The New York Times described Nemtsov after his death as a powerful , vigorous critic of Vladimir Putin , who was a deeply intelligent , witty , kind and ubiquitous man who seemed to genuinely be everyones friend .",
      "Reactions and sanctions .",
      "Political consultant Gleb Pavlovsky opined that Russia had been overcome by a Weimar atmosphere in which there were no longer any limits . Opposition activist Leonid Volkov maintained that Russians now lived in a different political reality .",
      "United States President Barack Obama called on Russias government to launch a prompt , impartial , and transparent investigation to ensure that those responsible for this vicious killing are brought to justice . German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the cowardly murder . A statement by her office demanded that Putin assure himself that this assassination is elucidated and that its perpetrators are held accountable .",
      "On 6 December 2017 , the Council of the District of Columbia held a hearing to decide on symbolically renaming a section of Wisconsin Avenue as Boris Nemtsov Plaza . The Embassy of the Russian Federation fronts the section of street proposed for the designation . On 9 January 2018 , the Council unanimously approved the Boris Nemtsov Plaza Designation Act of 2017 which authorized the renaming . The section of the street was renamed .",
      "On 12 March 2019 , the U.S . House of Representatives passed a series of bills meant to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable for his countrys actions , including a measure condemning the Russian leader and his government for their alleged roles in covering up the 2015 assassination of Putin political opponent Boris Nemtsov",
      "Convictions .",
      "Several suspects have been implicated in the assassination , all of whom are Chechens . The alleged shooter is a former officer in the security force of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov , who was also accused by opposition leader Ilya Yashin of having murdered Nemtsov .",
      "Five Chechen men were prosecuted for his murder . In late June 2017 , these men were found guilty by a jury in a court at Moscow for agreeing to kill Nemtsov in exchange for 15 million rubles ( US$253,000 ) ; neither the identity nor whereabouts of the person who hired them has been publicly revealed .",
      "Memorial rallies .",
      "At a memorial rally held in Moscow on 1 March , the date on which Nemtsov had planned to lead an opposition march , mourners carried signs that read : He was fighting for a free Russia , Those shots were in each of us , He died for the future of Russia , and They were afraid of you , Boris . Several thousand people also marched in St . Petersburg . Serge Schmemann of The New York Times wrote that the Moscow rally seemed like a memorial march for the hopes and dreams that lay alongside Mr . Nemtsovs murdered body in the middle of the night on the bridge to Red Square .",
      "In August 2015 , Nemtsovs daughter Zhanna Nemtsova was the recipient of Polands Democracy Award for her fathers work . On 9 October 2015 , opposition activists in Moscow erected a monument dedicated to Nemtsov at his tomb at Troyekurovskoye Cemetery , plot 16 . The monument , unveiled on what would have been his 56th birthday , shows Nemtsovs name with five bullet holes puncturing it .",
      "In late February 2017 , a peaceful protest and commemorative plaque dedication are planned in Nizhny Novgorod , in commemoration of his ideology and the freedom of speech that led to his assassination .",

      "Curt von Fran\u00e7ois",
      "Curt Karl Bruno von Fran\u00e7ois ( 2 October 1852 \u2013 28 December 1931 ) was a German geographer , cartographer , Schutztruppe officer and commissioner of the imperial colonial army of the German Empire , particularly in German South West Africa ( todays Namibia ) where he was responsible on behalf of Kaiser for the foundation of the city of Windhoek on 18 October 1890 and the harbor of Swakopmund on 4 August 1892 .",
      "Life .",
      "Fran\u00e7ois was born in Luxembourg of French Huguenot ancestry . He was the son of Prussian general Bruno von Fran\u00e7ois , who was killed in the battle of Spicheren . Curts younger brother Hermann von Fran\u00e7ois ( 1856\u20131933 ) served as a general in World War I and was one of the key contributors to the German victory at the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg . The writer Louise von Fran\u00e7ois was his aunt .",
      "Like his ancestors , young Curt von Fran\u00e7ois joined the Prussian Cadet Corps . He served as a soldier in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 , whereby his father was killed in action during the Battle of Spicheren on 6 August 1870 , and was awarded the Iron Cross . In 1883 he worked as a geographer on an exploratory expedition along the Kasai River in the Congo region under the leadership of Hermann Wissmann and two years later joined another expedition into the Congo led by George Grenfell . Back in Germany , he became a member of the German General Staff , and was elevated to the rank of Hauptmann ( Captain ) . In 1887 he was stationed as a research officer in German West Africa . On behalf of the Foreign Office , he explored Togoland and the trade route to Salaga up to the Mossi territory in the north .",
      "South West Africa .",
      "In 1883 , the German merchant Adolf L\u00fcderitz had purchased the coastal area of Angra Pequena , following negotiations with a local African chief . He called this coastal region of southwestern Africa L\u00fcderitz . Fearing that the British were soon to declare the area a protectorate , L\u00fcderitz advised the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck to claim it , which he did at the Berlin Conference of 1884 . On October 7 , the colony of German South West Africa was established under Reichskommissar governor Gustav Nachtigal .",
      "However , the German authorities met with fierce resistance by the local Herero people . When in 1888 their officials were forcibly expelled from Okahandja , the German Colonial Society engaged Hauptmann Curt von Fran\u00e7ois to provide security to the territory . In June 1889 he arrived with 21 troopers , 8 soldiers of the Imperial Army and 13 volunteers in the British-held enclave of Walvis Bay . Soon afterwards Fran\u00e7ois stationed himself at Otjimbingwe ( against the advice of acting commissioner Heinrich G\u00f6ring ) in order to deal with opponents to German authority in the interior of the territory . In May 1890 he renewed a former peace agreement with the Herero chief Maharero and eventually occupied the completely destroyed settlement of Windhoek ( founded by Jonker Afrikaner decades earlier ) . Upon Mahareros death in October , his son Samuel Maharero had to reaffirm the treaty . At Windhoek , Fran\u00e7ois set up the new headquarters of the German occupation ( which he called Alte Feste , Old Fortress ) . This location was chosen because the Germans felt it would serve as a buffer zone between the Nama and Herero tribes .",
      "After G\u00f6ring was recalled from office , Fran\u00e7ois served as Reichskommissar of German South West Africa from March 1891 until November 1893 . Within this time period ( on 12 September 1892 ) he established the coastal town of Swakopmund as the main harbour of German South West Africa and mapped large parts of the colony . In November 1893 he was promoted to Major and given the title of Landeshauptmann .",
      "However , Fran\u00e7ois at the same time had to cope with the rising resistance by the Nama people . On 12 April 1893 he led an attack of 225 German soldiers on Nama leader Hendrik Witboois headquarters at Hoornkrans west of Rehoboth . The shelling of the Oorlam kraal and its final storming led to tremendous civilian casualties . Rendered as the Massacre of Hoornkrans by the international press , it severely damaged Fran\u00e7ois reputation . Moreover , Witbooi escaped and fled into the Naukluft Mountains , where he waged several months of guerrilla warfare against the German forces .",
      "Fran\u00e7ois force was formally established as the Imperial Schutztruppe for German South West Africa by the Reich Law of 9 June 1895 .",
      "Later years .",
      "In 1894 Fran\u00e7ois was replaced by Theodor Leutwein as Landeshauptmann of South West Africa . He embarked in Cape Town to Germany and during the following year he retired from military life . In retirement in Zernsdorf , Brandenburg , he wrote extensively about his experiences in Africa . He died in a K\u00f6nigs Wusterhausen hospital on 28 December 1931 . Fran\u00e7ois was buried in the Invalids Cemetery in Berlin , his grave is not preserved .",
      "The original Schutztruppe headquarters built at the behest of Fran\u00e7ois in 1890 at Windhoek was expanded in 1912 , and has been a museum since 1962 .",
      "Recognition .",
      "In front of Windhoeks municipal buildings there is a statue of von Fran\u00e7ois . It was inaugurated on 18 October 1965 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the second foundation of the town by him .",

      "Alemannia Aachen",
      "Alemannia Aachen ( ) or ATSV Alemannia 1900 is a German football club from the western city of Aachen , North Rhine-Westphalia . A long term fixture of the countrys second division , Alemannia enjoyed a three-year turn in the Bundesliga in the late 1960s and , after a successful 2005\u201306 campaign , returned to the first division for a single season . The club has since slipped to third division play and in late 2012 entered into bankruptcy . They finished their 2012\u201313 3 . Liga schedule before resuming play in the tier IV Regionalliga West in 2013\u201314 .",
      "Alemannia carries the nickname the potato beetles ( Kartoffelk\u00e4fer ) because of their striped yellow-black jerseys , which make them look like the particular insects .",
      "History .",
      "Foundation to World War II .",
      "In the second half of the 19th century , resident English merchants and industrialists brought football , in addition to the traditional equestrian sports , into the western Rhineland . The club was founded on 16 December 1900 by a group of eighteen high school students . Knowing that another team had already taken the name 1 . FC Aachen , the new club was christened FC Alemannia using a Latin word for Germany ( see Alamannia ) . The First World War devastated the club : the pre-war membership of 200 was reduced to just 37 by the conflict . In early 1919 Alemannia merged with Aachener Turnverein 1847 to become TSV Alemannia Aachen 1900 . Their new partners interest was primarily in gymnastics and the union was short-lived , with the clubs splitting again in 1924 .",
      "The city of Aachen is near the Belgian and Dutch borders and as a result Alemannia has had frequent contact with clubs from those countries . Their first game was against the Belgian side R . Dolhain F.C. , one of that countrys earliest clubs . There are intensive and friendly contacts with the Dutch professional club Roda JC Kerkrade . Both clubs have the same club colors .",
      "The team played in the Rhineland-Westphalia FA and won its first championship there in 1907 , before joining the newly formed Westdeutsche Fussball Verband in 1909 . The club grew steadily as interest in football increased . They qualified for the Rheingauliga in 1921 , built their own stadium in 1928 , and earned admittance to the Oberliga the following year .",
      "The club enjoyed some success in the early 1930s by advancing to the final four of the Westdeutsche championship playoffs . In 1933 , German football was re-organized under the Third Reich into sixteen top-flight Gauligen . Alemannia played several seasons in the Gauliga Mittelrhein in the late 1930s and early 1940s . They finished atop their division in 1938 and advanced to the national final rounds . This was in spite of a protest by SV Beuel 06 which ultimately saw that club awarded the division championship , but too late to allow Beuel to play in the national playoff in Aachens stead .",
      "Alemannia is known as one of the few of this era to offer any challenge to the Nazi regimes purge of Jews from the countrys sports organizations by demanding the release of a jailed Jewish member .",
      "Postwar and entry to the Bundesliga .",
      "In 1946 , after World War II and the lifting of the ban placed by Allied occupation authorities on most types of organizations in Germany , Alemannia re-constituted itself and began play in second tier Rheinbezirk . They returned to first division play in the Oberliga West the next year , but ran into financial difficulty . They remained a steady , but unspectacular second division side , generally finishing mid-table .",
      "Aachens first measure of success came with an advance to the DFB-Pokal final in 1953 where they lost a 1\u20132 decision to Rot-Weiss Essen .",
      "After the formation of the Bundesliga , Germanys new professional football league , in 1963 , Alemannia found themselves in Regionalliga West ( II ) . In 1965 , they had another good run in German Cup competition , earning another final appearance \u2013 but were once again unsuccessful \u2013 this time losing 0\u20132 to Borussia Dortmund .",
      "The club captured their division in 1967 and were promoted to the Bundesliga ( I ) for the 1967\u201368 season . They enjoyed their best ever result the next year with a second-place finish behind champion Bayern Munich . However , the following season was a disaster : the team earned only one point in play away from home and toppled to an 18th-place finish . They returned to play in the Regionalliga West ( II ) , and in 1990 fell still further to the third division .",
      "Road to recovery .",
      "After several mediocre seasons in the second half of the 1990s , trainer Werner Fuchs rejuvenated the Alemannia squad by playing 4\u20134\u20132 without a libero ( sweeper ) , creating a side that played an attractive , fluid offense . In 1999 , the team played well and delivered an especially strong second half . They were atop the table , just weeks away from the end of the season , when tragedy struck with the unexpected death of Fuchs . The whole city was in shock , but the club managed to pull through , dedicating their promotion to their late trainer and winning the Regionalliga West/S\u00fcdwest ( III ) . The first years in the 2 . Bundesliga were tough for Aachen , both on the field and financially . The club struggled for several seasons and the situation was worsened when financial irregularities were uncovered showing the club was near bankruptcy .",
      "The turnaround came with a new executive board under president Horst Heinrichs , trainer Dieter Hecking and manager J\u00f6rg Schmadtke . Through improved financial management , shrewd player signings , and clever game tactics , Aachen became a power once again in the 2003\u201304 season . They played their way to their third DFB-Pokal final appearance , knocking off TSV 1860 Munich , Bayern Munich , and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach , before losing 2\u20133 to Bundesliga champions Werder Bremen . As league champions Bremen already held a place in the UEFA Champions League , thereby making room for Aachen to take part in the UEFA Cup competition . They delivered a decent performance , advancing to the Round of 32 before going out to eventual semi-finalists AZ Alkmaar . The clubs participation in the German Cup and UEFA Cup play helped to significantly improve their financial situation .",
      "Bundesliga and 2 . Bundesliga .",
      "On 16 April 2006 , Alemannia became the first team to earn promotion to the Bundesliga in 2005\u201306 , ending Aachens 36-year absence from top-flight football . However , they stayed up only a single season as they took only one point from their last eight matches of the campaign . In the middle of 2007 , the club appointed former German international defender and 1990 FIFA World Champion Guido Buchwald as manager trainer , who was fired after only 14 matches . After a short interim with Alemannias Sportsmanger J\u00f6rg Schmadtke as headcoach , he was then replaced by J\u00fcrgen Seeberger , hardly known in Germany , in the winter break of the season .",
      "The club suffered a rapid decline after its single Bundesliga season , being relegated from the 2 . Bundesliga in 2012 and from the 3 . Liga the season after . Alemannia consequently now plays in the tier four Regionalliga West .",

      "Sovremennik ( , The Contemporary ) was a Russian literary , social and political magazine , published in Saint Petersburg in 1836\u20131866 . It came out four times a year in 1836\u20131843 and once a month after that . The magazine published poetry , prose , critical , historical , ethnographic and other material .",
      "Sovremennik originated as a private enterprise of Alexander Pushkin who was running out of money to support his growing family . To assist him with the magazine , the poet asked Nikolai Gogol , Pyotr Vyazemsky and Vladimir Odoyevsky to contribute their works to the journal . It was there that the first substantial assortment of Fyodor Tyutchevs poems was published . Soon it became clear that Pushkins establishment could not compete with Faddey Bulgarins journal , which published more popular and less demanding literature . Sovremennik was out of date and could not command a paying audience .",
      "When Pushkin died , his friend Pyotr Pletnyov took over the editorship in 1838 . A few years later the magazine fell into decline , and Pletnyov handed it over to Nikolay Nekrasov and Ivan Panaev in 1847 . It was Nekrasov who really made the magazine profitable . He enlisted the services of Ivan Turgenev , Ivan Goncharov , Alexander Herzen and Nikolai Ogaryov . Sovremennik was the first to publish translated works by Charles Dickens , George Sand and other best-selling foreign writers .",
      "Although the magazine was owned and run by Nekrasov , its official editor-in-chief was Alexander Nikitenko . The virulent realist critic Vissarion Belinsky was responsible for its ideology . His criticism of present-day reality and propaganda of democratic ideas made the journal very popular among the Russian intelligentsia . Sovremenniks circulation was 3,100 copies in 1848 .",
      "During the reactionary reign of Nicholas I , the journal had to struggle against censorship and complaints of disgruntled aristocracy . Its position grew more complicated after Herzens emigration ( 1847 ) and Belinskys death ( 1848 ) . Despite these hardships , Sovremennik published works by best Russian authors of the day : Leo Tolstoy , Turgenev and Nekrasov . Timofey Granovsky , Sergey Solovyov and other leading historians were published as well .",
      "The period between 1852 and 1862 is considered to be the most brilliant in the history of the journal . Nekrasov managed to strike a deal with its leading contributors , whereby their new works were to be published exclusively by him . As regards ideology , Sovremennik grew more radical together with its audience . Belinsky was succeeded by Nikolai Chernyshevsky in 1853 and by Nikolai Dobrolyubov . All their principal articles were published in Sovremennik .",
      "In late 1858 , the magazine entered into polemics with the liberal and conservative press and became a platform for and ideological center of the revolutionary democracy , turning into a political magazine . In 1861 , it published materials , dedicated to the emancipation of the serfs and advocated the interests of serfs in the strongest terms possible . In 1859-1861 , Sovremennik argued with Herzens Kolokol about the aims of the Russian democracy .",
      "Such a radical stance alienated those writers who were indifferent to politics or personally disliked revolutionary intelligentsia . Although Tolstoy , Turgenev , and Dmitry Grigorovich eventually left the magazine , Sovremenniks circulation reached 7,126 copies in 1861 . The death of Dobrolyubov in 1861 , an 8-month suspension of publishing activities ( in June 1862 ) , and Chernyshevskys arrest caused irreparable damage to the magazine . Its ideological stance became less clear and consistent .",
      "In 1863 , Nekrasov managed to resume publishing Sovremennik . He invited Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin ( stayed until 1864 ) , Maxim Antonovich , Grigory Yeliseyev and Alexander Pypin to join its editorial staff . Controversy among the members of the editorial staff soon resulted in adoption of a more temperate policy .",
      "In 1863-1866 , Sovremennik published Chernyshevskys What Is to Be Done ? ( written in the Peter and Paul Fortress ) , satires by Saltykov-Shchedrin , and works by the so-called plebeian authors ( Vasily Sleptsov , Fyodor Reshetnikov , Gleb Uspensky ) . The magazine was closed down in June 1866 , owing to the official panic that followed the first attempt on Alexander IIs life . After that , Nekrasov and Saltykov-Schedrin acquired the rights to publish the Otechestvennye Zapiski , a literary journal widely viewed as Sovremenniks successor ."

When he was 13 , his parents moved to Cole County , Missouri . Two years later , they moved again to Jefferson City , which Parsons would thereafter make his home . As a young man , Mosby read law and was admitted to the bar in 1846 . He served as a volunteer in the Mexican\u2013American War with the rank of captain in Colonel Alexander W . Doniphans regiment and was cited for gallantry at the Battle of Sacramento on February 28 , 1847 .",
      "Returning to Missouri after the war , Parsons married Mary Wells on September 18 , 1850 . However , his wife died just three years later , leaving him with an infant son , Stephen Kearney Parsons . Parsons served as the United States District Attorney for western Missouri . In 1856 was elected to the state legislature . He became a Missouri state senator in 1858 , serving until the American Civil War .",

He arrived too late to participate in the skirmish at Boonville , but he went on to lead his division at Carthage and the Battle of Wilsons Creek in Missouri . Although his Missouri State Guardsmen participated in the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas , Parsons was absent from this action seeking an appointment in the Confederate States Army in Richmond , Virginia .",
      "Parsons was commissioned a brigadier general of the Confederacy on November 5 , 1862 and led his infantry brigade in the Battle of Prairie Grove , Arkansas , one month later . His force would participate in the attack at Helena , Arkansas on July 4 , 1863 , and assisted Richard Taylor in thwarting Union Major General Nathaniel Banks Red River Campaign of 1864 in Louisiana ( Battle of Pleasant Hill ) , as well as opposing Union Major General Frederick Steeles Camden Expedition in Arkansas , including participation at the Battle of Jenkins Ferry .

      "Senate of the Kingdom of Italy",
      "The Senate of the Kingdom of Italy ( ) was the upper house of the bicameral parliament of the Kingdom of Italy , established on 17 March 1861 upon Italian unification to replace the Subalpine Senate . It was suppressed on 7 November 1947 and replaced by the present-day Senate of the Republic . Its members were all appointed by the King of Italy .",
      "History .",
      "The Senate of the Kingdom of Italy was created in 1861 , following the Unification of Italy , as the direct successor of the Subalpine Senate of the Kingdom of Sardinia , with the addition of members drawn from the territories conquered during the Second Italian War of Independence and the Expedition of the Thousand .",
      "The Senate was initially based at the Palazzo Madama in Turin , until 1864 when it was moved to the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence . Finally , in 1871 , it was moved to the Palazzo Madama in Rome .",
      "During the fascist regime , there was no fascistisation ( fascistizzazione ) of the Senate equivalent to that carried out in the lower house . Members of the Senate appointed before the March on Rome , such as Einaudi and Croce , retained their seats in the Senate . However , in 1939 , when the lower house was transformed into the Chamber of Fasces and Corporations , 211 new members were added to the Senate . When Fascism fell on 25 July 1943 , King Victor Emmanuel III appointed Paolo Thaon di Revel as the President of the Senate - he entered office on 2 August 1943 .",
      "On 20 July 1944 , Pietro Tomasi Della Torretta was appointed as the final President of the Senate , an office which he retained until 25 June 1946 . In August 1944 , all Senators responsible for maintaining Fascism and enabling the war , through their votes and their individual actions , including propaganda carried out within or without the Senate were dismissed from office .",
      "Transformation into the Senate of the Republic .",
      "Following the Institutional Referendum of 2 June 1946 and the election of the Constituent Assembly of Italy , the Senate of the Kingdom ceased to function on 25 June 1946 . It was formally suppressed on 7 November 1947 , thus bringing the Senate to extinction , although in fact it had lost almost all its limited power during the final years of the Fascist Regime . During the Fascist period , the Senate contained Fascist members , but because senators held office for life , it had remained somewhat outside Mussolinis state system and so , over time , it was pushed ever further towards the margins of political life .",
      "The Senate of the Kingdom was the inspiration for the current Senate of the Republic , which came into existence on 8 May 1948 .",
      "The existence of the group of Senators for life in the modern Senate of the Republic represents a final survival of the life-long office of the Senators of the Kingdom of Italy .",
      "Structure .",
      "The King appointed the Senators of the Kingdom ad vitam ( for life ) . They were entitled to slightly higher honours than the elected deputies of the lower house . In time , although remaining formally a royal power , the appointment of senators came to be carried out largely on the recommendations of the Prime Minister , who was always in a position to influence the decisions of the king and to enhance support for the government in the Senate through the appointment of batches of Senators . Under Article 33 of the Albertine Statute , the number of Senators was not limited , but they had to be over forty years of age and drawn from one of the following categories :",

      "16 . Division councillors who had served three terms as council president ;",

      "20 . Anyone who had glorified the nation through outstanding service or merit ;",
      "21 . Anyone who paid three thousand lira in import taxes over a period of three years on their own property or company .",
      "Male members of the Royal family were members of the Senate by default and sat immediately behind the President of the Senate . They began to attend the Senate once they reached twenty-one years of age and were allowed to vote once they reached twenty-five .",

She was succeeded as Prime Minister by John Key of the National Party , and as Leader of the Labour Party by Phil Goff .",
      "Clark resigned from Parliament in April 2009 shortly after losing the 2008 general election , to become the first female head of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) . In 2016 , she stood for the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations , but was unsuccessful . She left her UNDP administrator post on 19 April 2017 at the end of her second four-year term and was succeeded by Achim Steiner . In 2019 , Clark became the patron of The Helen Clark Foundation .",
      "Early life .",
      "Clark was the eldest of four daughters of a farming family at Te Pahu , west of Hamilton , in the Waikato region . Her mother , Margaret McMurray , of Irish birth , was a primary school teacher . Her father , George , was a farmer . Clark studied at Te Pahu Primary School , at Epsom Girls Grammar School in Auckland and at the University of Auckland , where she majored in politics and graduated with an MA ( Honours ) in 1974 . Her thesis focused on rural political behaviour and representation . As a teenager Clark became politically active , protesting against the Vietnam War and campaigning against foreign military bases in New Zealand .",
      "Clark has worked actively in the New Zealand Labour Party for most of her life . In 1971 she assisted Labour candidates to the Auckland City Council , three of whom were elected . Following this , she stood for the Auckland City Council herself in 1974 and 1977 . While generally polling well , she never won a seat , missing out by only 105 votes in the latter .",
      "Clark was a junior lecturer in political studies at the University of Auckland from 1973 to 1975 . In 1974 she sought the nomination for the Auckland Central electorate , but lost to Richard Prebble . She instead stood for , a National safe seat . Clark studied abroad on a University Grants Committee post-graduate scholarship in 1976 , and then lectured in political studies at Auckland again while undertaking her PhD ( which she never completed ) from 1977 until her election to Parliament in 1981 . Her father supported National that election .",
      "Clark served as a member of Labours national executive committee from 1978 until September 1988 , and again from April 1989 . She chaired the University of Auckland Princes Street branch of the Labour Party during her studies , becoming active alongside future Labour politicians including Richard Prebble , David Caygill , Margaret Wilson and Richard Northey . Clark held the positions of president of the Labour Youth Council , executive member of the partys Auckland Regional Council , secretary of the Labour Womens Council and member of the Policy Council .",
      "She represented the New Zealand Labour Party at the congresses of the Socialist International and of the Socialist International Women in 1976 , 1978 , 1983 and 1986 , at an Asia-Pacific Socialist Organisation Conference held in Sydney in 1981 , and at the Socialist International Party Leaders Meeting in Sydney in 1991 .",
      "Member of Parliament .",
      "Clark did not contest the , but in 1980 she put her name forward to replace long serving MP Warren Freer in the safe Labour seat of Mount Albert . She beat six other contenders including electorate chairman Keith Elliot , former MP Malcolm Douglas and future MP Jack Elder for the nomination .",
      "Clark was duly elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives in the 1981 general election , as one of eight female members in the 40th Parliament . In winning the Mount Albert electorate in Auckland , she became the second woman elected to represent an Auckland electorate , and the seventeenth woman elected to the New Zealand Parliament . Her first parliamentary intervention , on taking her seat was on 12 April 1982 to give notice , she would move a motion condemning the US Navys deployment of nuclear cruise missiles in the Pacific Two weeks later in her maiden speech , with unusual emphasis on defence policy and the arms race , Clark again condemned the deployment of cruise , Pershing and SS20 and the global ambitions of both superpowers navies , but claimed the Soviet admirals did not plough New Zealands waters and expressed particular concern about the expansion of the 1965 memo of ANZUS understanding for the resupply of weapons to New Zealand to include nuclear weapon resupply .",
      "During her first term in the House ( 1981\u20131984 ) , Clark became a member of the Statutes Revision Committee . In her second term ( 1984\u20131987 ) , she chaired the Select committee on Foreign Affairs and the Select Committee on Disarmament and Arms Control , both of which combined with the Defence Select Committee in 1985 to form a single committee . In 1983 she was appointed as Labours spokesperson for Overseas Aid and Disarmament .",
      "Cabinet Minister .",
      "In 1987 , Clark became a Cabinet minister in the Fourth Labour Government , led by David Lange ( 1984\u20131989 ) , Geoffrey Palmer ( 1989\u20131990 ) and Mike Moore ( 1990 ) . She served as Minister of Conservation from August 1987 until January 1989 and as Minister of Housing from August 1987 until August 1989 . She became Minister of Health in January 1989 , and took on additional portfolios as Minister of Labour and Deputy Prime Minister in August 1989 . As Health Minister , Clark introduced a series of legislative changes that allowed midwives to practice autonomously . She also introduced the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 , a law which restricted smoking in places such as workplaces and schools .",
      "As Deputy Prime Minister , Clark chaired the Cabinet Social Equity Committee , and was a member of several other important Cabinet committees , such as the Policy Committee , Economic Development and Employment Committee , and Domestic and External Security Committee .",
      "Leader of the Opposition .",
      "From October 1990 until December 1993 Clark held the posts of Deputy Leader of the Opposition , Shadow spokesperson for Health and Labour , and member of the Social Services Select Committee and of the Labour Select Committee . After the National Party won the 1993 general election with a majority of one seat , Clark successfully challenged Mike Moore for the leadership of the parliamentary party . She was particularly critical of Moore for delivering blurred messages during the 1993 election campaign , and accused him of failing to re-brand Labour as a centre-left party which had jettisoned Rogernomics .",
      "Clark became the Leader of the Opposition on 1 December 1993 . She led the Labour Party in opposition to the National-led government of Jim Bolger ( 1990\u20131997 ) and Jenny Shipley ( 1997\u20131999 ) . Clark announced her first shadow cabinet on 13 December 1993 , but the ousted Moore refused any portfolios . There were frequent changes after several party defections took place during the parliamentary term in the lead up to the new MMP voting system . At one reshuffle , in June 1995 , Clark herself took the shadow foreign affairs portfolio .",
      "The Labour Party rated poorly in opinion polls in the run-up to the 1996 general election , and Clark suffered from a low personal approval rating . At one point polls suggested that New Zealand First of Winston Peters would even poll 30% and Labour would be beaten into third place . However , she survived an attempted leadership coup by senior members who favoured Phil Goff . Labour lost the election in October 1996 , but Clark remained as Opposition leader . Clark was seen as having convincingly won the election debates which led to Labour doing better than predicted . Shortly before the election she also achieved a rapprochement with Moore ( who was previously thinking of setting up his own party ) who accepted the foreign affairs and overseas trade portfolios , calming internal tensions .",
      "During the 1998 Waitangi Day celebrations , Clark was prevented from speaking on the marae by activist Titewhai Harawira in protest over Clarks being allowed to speak in direct contradiction of traditional M\u0101ori protocol . The ensuing argument saw Clark being reduced to tears on national television .",
      "In 1999 , Clark was involved in a defamation case in the High Court of New Zealand with Auckland orthopaedic surgeon Joe Brownlee , resulting in Clarks making an unreserved apology . The case centered on a press statement issued by Clark criticising Brownlee , triggered by a constituents complaint over the outcome of a hip replacement . Clark admitted the criticism was unjustified in that the complication suffered by her constituent was rare , unforeseen and unavoidable .",
      "Prime Minister ( 1999\u20132008 ) .",
      "Under Clarks leadership , Labour became the largest party in parliament from 1999 to 2008 . Clark became the second woman to serve as Prime Minister of New Zealand , and the first to have won office at an election . She also served as the Minister for Arts , Culture and Heritage throughout her premiership . She had additional ministerial responsibility for the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service ( NZSIS ) and for Ministerial Services . During her period in office , women held a number of prominent elected and appointed offices in New Zealand , such as the Governor-General , Speaker of the House of Representatives and Chief Justice\u2014these major offices of state were simultaneously occupied by women between March 2005 and August 2006 . As a female head of government , Clark was a member of the Council of Women World Leaders .",
      "Clark entered office just three years after the adoption of the Mixed Member Proportional ( MMP ) voting system , which had produced an unstable National-led government under Bolger and Shipley . Clark negotiated the formation of successive coalition governments . Political scientist Bryce Edwards identified Clarks ability to lead stable governments as her most significant achievement , arguing that her ability to work with a variety of coalition partners\u2014including the Alliance , Jim Andertons Progressive Party , Green , United Future and New Zealand First\u2014consolidated public support for MMP .",
      "Clarks particular interests included social policy and international affairs . A strong supporter of nuclear disarmament , Clark pursued a policy of peace-making within the Pacific region . She set herself the task of making New Zealand the first ecologically sustainable nation , describing this as central to New Zealands unique national identity . Her governments major policy achievements include the Working for Families package , increasing the minimum wage 5% a year , interest-free student loans , creation of District Health Boards , the introduction of a number of tax credits , overhauling the secondary school qualifications by introducing NCEA , and the introduction of fourteen weeks\u2019 parental leave . Commentators praised Clark ( along with Michael Cullen , the Minister of Finance ) for overseeing a period of sustained and stable economic growth , with an increase in employment that saw a gradual lowering of the unemployment rate to a record low of 3.6% ( in 2005 ) .",
      "Clark made every attempt to make sure that gender was not an issue in politics . However , Bryce Edwards states that others did . Clark was portrayed as bloodsucking , cold , and humourless . Clark says herself that when her male counterparts spoke in the media , they looked strong and determined , whereas when she portrayed the same characteristics , the media made it to look like she was tough and nagging .",
      "In 2006 Clark was 20th in Forbes magazines ranking of the worlds 100 most powerful women . By the time she left office in 2008 this had fallen to 56th .",
      "First term : 1999\u20132002 .",
      "The 1999 general election produced a historic moment for New Zealand ; for the first time , two women , Clark and Shipley , campaigned against each other as leaders of the countrys two major parties . Clark repeatedly stated her desire to govern alone rather than as part of a coalition . However , in the lead up to the election , Labour made overtures to the left-wing Alliance . Clark addressed the Alliances annual conference in August 1998 . On polling day Labour returned 49 seats , an increase of 12 , ahead of Nationals 39 seats . The first Clark-led Cabinet linked Labour with the Alliance . Alliance leader Jim Anderton served as Deputy Prime Minister under Clark until 2002 . The full ministerial team , and portfolios , was announced on 9 December\u201412 days after the election\u2014and the new government was sworn in the following day . The coalition partners pioneered agree to disagree procedures to manage policy differences . Such procedures lessened the chances of Cabinet becoming publicly divided and running the risk of losing the confidence of the House of Representatives .",
      "In January 2000 , the then Police Commissioner , Peter Doone , resigned after The Sunday Star-Times alleged he had prevented the breath testing of his partner Robyn , who had driven the car they occupied , by telling the officer that wont be necessary . Both Doone and the officer involved denied this happened . Doone sued the Sunday Star-Times for defamation in 2005 , but the paper revealed they had checked the story with Clark . She confirmed this , but denied that she had made attempts to get Doone to resign and defended being the source as by definition I cannot leak . Clark also responded by saying that National supporters had funded Doones defamation-suit . Opinion on the significance of this incident varied .",
      "In 2000 , Labour MP Chris Carter investigated the background of one of Clarks Cabinet colleagues , M\u0101ori Affairs Minister Dover Samuels , regarding allegations of historic statutory rape . Ex-convict John Yelash claimed that Carter had approached him to help with the investigation ; a claim that Carter denied . Clark backed her MP , referring to Yelash as a murderer when he had in fact been convicted of manslaughter , a less serious offence . Yelash sued Clark for defamation , resulting in an out-of-court settlement .",
      "In April 2001 , Clark met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin during an official visit to Beijing . Jiang referred to the Prime Minister as an old friend . He stated that China hoped to establish bilateral long-term and stable overall cooperative relations [ with New Zealand ] . Clark strongly supported Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization .",
      "In March 2002 , Clark made her first visit to the United States as Prime Minister . She visited Ground Zero , the former site of the World Trade Center , where the New York City Police Department presented her with a New Zealand flag that had been recovered from the rubble after the September 11 attacks . On 26 March , Clark visited the Pentagon and Washington , D.C. , where she met with American officials , including a private meeting with President George W . Bush . Most of the agenda for Clarks visit focused on the joint counter-terrorism campaign ( dubbed the War on Terror ) .",
      "As Opposition Leader in 1998 , Clark signed her name to a canvas that had been painted on by another artist . The painting was subsequently auctioned to charity . After the act came to light in April 2002 , the opposition National Party referred the matter to the Police . A police report found evidence for a prima facie case of forgery , but determined that it was not in the public interest to prosecute Clark .",
      "In June 2002 , Clark apologised on behalf of New Zealand for aspects of the countrys treatment of Samoa during the colonial era . Clarks apology was made in Apia during the 40th anniversary of Samoas independence and televised live to New Zealand where Samoans applauded the Prime Ministers gesture .",
      "The Alliance split in 2002 over the Governments commitment of New Zealand troops to the War in Afghanistan , leading to the imminent dissolution of Labours coalition with that party . Consequently , Clark called for an early election to be held on 27 July . Political opponents claimed that Clark could have continued to govern , and that a snap election was called to take advantage of Labours strong position in opinion polls . In opinion surveys conducted during the election campaign , Clark scored high approval ratings and was far ahead of other party leaders as preferred Prime Minister .",
      "A major issue during the 2002 election campaign was the end of a moratorium on genetic engineering , strongly opposed by the rival Green Party . The debate was reignited when investigative journalist Nicky Hager published a book , Seeds of Distrust , in which he alleged that Clarks government had covered up a contamination of genetically modified corn plants in 2000 . A television interview with John Campbell was terminated by Clark when she was taken by surprise from the allegations , which she claimed to have known nothing about prior to the interview . The affair was dubbed Corngate by the media .",
      "Second term : 2002\u20132005 .",
      "Clark won a second term in the 2002 general election\u2014her party increased both its share of the vote and number of seats . Labour subsequently entered into a coalition with Jim Andertons Progressive Party ( a spin-off of the Alliance ) , with parliamentary confidence and supply coming from United Future , and a good-faith agreement with the Green Party . Michael Cullen , who served as Minister of Finance , was appointed Deputy Prime Minister by Clark , replacing Anderton .",
      "A republican , Clark stated in 2002 that she thought it was inevitable that New Zealand would become a republic in the near future . Her term in office saw a number of alleged moves in this direction , under her governments policy of building national identity . Examples include the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council in London and the foundation of the Supreme Court of New Zealand , the abolition of titular Knighthood and Damehood honours ( restored in 2009 ) , and the abolition of the title Queens Counsel ( replaced by Senior Counsel , restored in 2012 ) .",
      "In 2003 , Clark criticised the Invasion of Iraq without an explicit United Nations mandate , and her government opposed New Zealand military action in the Iraq War . Her government did not send combat troops to Iraq , although some medical and engineering units were sent . Clarks foreign policy reflected the priorities of liberal internationalism , especially the promotion of democracy and human rights ; the strengthening of the role of the United Nations ; the advancement of antimilitarism and disarmament ; and the encouragement of free-trade . In March 2003 , referring to the US-led coalitions actions in Iraq , Clark told the newspaper The Sunday Star-Times that , I dont think that 11 September under a Gore presidency would have had this consequence for Iraq . She later sent a letter to Washington apologising for any offence that her comment may have caused .",
      "On 17 July 2004 , a motorcade involving police , Diplomatic Protection Squad , and Ministerial Services staff reached speeds of up to 172 km/h when taking Clark and Cabinet Minister Jim Sutton from Waimate to Christchurch Airport so she could attend a rugby union match in Wellington . The courts subsequently convicted the drivers involved for driving offences , but appeals resulted in the quashing of these convictions in December 2005 and August 2006 .",
      "Clark said that she was busy working in the back seat and had no influence or role in the decision to speed and did not realise the speed of her vehicle .",
      "In November 2004 , Clark announced that negotiations with China had commenced for a free-trade agreement , eventually signing a comprehensive agreement in July 2008 . It was New Zealands largest trade deal since the 1983 Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia .",
      "Third term : 2005\u20132008 .",
      "In 2005 , following that years general election , Labour and the Progressive Party renewed their coalition , with confidence and supply arrangements with both New Zealand First and United Future in exchange for giving the leaders of those parties ministerial positions outside Cabinet . Clark became first Labour leader to win three consecutive elections . Clark won 66% of her electorates votes , or 20,918 votes with a 14,749 majority .",
      "On Armistice Day , 11 November 2006 , Clark attended a service in Hyde Park , London , where a monument commemorating New Zealands war dead was unveiled . During her visit she met Queen Elizabeth , Prince Charles and British Prime Minister Tony Blair .",
      "On 26 May 2006 , Clark ordered a military deployment to the 2006 East Timorese crisis alongside international partners .",
      "Clarks major overseas visit of her third term was a trip to the United States in March 2007 , where she met with George W . Bush in Washington . Despite her strained relationship with the President , they agreed on many issues , including working cooperatively in foreign affairs , commerce and the need for both nations to work toward energy security .",
      "On 8 February 2008 , Clark was recognised as the longest-serving leader of the Labour Party in its history ( although some uncertainty exists over the exact date when Harry Holland became party leader ) , having served for 14 years , 69 days . By 26 October 2008 she had passed Hollands longest possible term and her position as longest-serving Labour leader was put beyond doubt .",
      "By the end of her tenure in office , Clark had come to be seen as a divisive figure , going from a Herald-DigiPoll popularity rating of nearly 60% in 2005 to 42% at the time of the 2008 general election . Portrayals of Clark as controlling and manipulative after the 2005 election increased when she abandoned her consensus-managerial approach , such as during the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy , and her support of the Crimes ( Substituted Section 59 ) Amendment Act 2007 ( the so-called anti-smacking law ) . She was accused of having a nanny state approach to social issues , a perception captured by the pejorative term Helengrad .",
      "Labour had been consistently behind the National Party in opinion polls since 2006 , and the gap widened significantly in early 2007 . On 5 August 2008 the Treasury announced that the New Zealand economy had entered a recession .",
      "Clarks personal popularity was eclipsed by John Key soon after the latters election as National Party Leader in November 2006 . In the final media polls prior to the Key was ahead of Clark in preferred prime minister polls by eight points in the Fairfax Media Nielsen poll and four points in the One News Colmar Brunton poll . In the 2008 election campaign , Clark attacked the National Party as insincere in its promise to maintain many of her governments flagship projects , such as KiwiSaver and Kiwibank .",
      "National overtook Labour as the largest party following the 2008 election . Labour did not have the numbers to ally with smaller parties and no viable path to government ; Clark conceded defeat to Key and announced that she was standing down as party leader . On 11 November 2008 Clark was succeeded by Phil Goff as Leader of the Labour Party . In the first Labour Party conference after its defeat Phil Goff acknowledged that Clarks government had become identified with nanny-state policies in the public mind , and said that the party wanted to draw a line under the past and say , yes , we made mistakes , we didnt listen .",
      "Reputation and legacy .",
      "Early in her career Clark gained a reputation as a capable advocate of nuclear disarmament and public health policy . As party leader , Clark denounced Rogernomics as a ghastly period and won the 1999 election by abandoning its legacy . However , biographer Denis Welch has argued that she did not do enough to repudiate the paradigm created by Rogernomics , instead allowing Labour and National to become increasingly hard to tell apart on many issues .",
      "Clarks government was pragmatic , managerial , concerned with stability , and focused on incremental changes over grand projects . Political scientist Bryce Edwards argues that Clark was never a conviction politician and set out to be a successful rather than great politician , leaving behind a legacy of incremental reforms of New Zealand and good management of the status quo , but no bold ambitions . Likewise , commentator John Armstrong , while praising Clark , describes her as a technocratic prime minister who will be remembered more for her management abilities than a capacity to inspire .",
      "In January 2009 , two months after losing office , Clark was voted Greatest Living New Zealander in an opt-in website poll run by The New Zealand Herald . In a close race she received 25 percent of the vote , ahead of Victoria Cross recipient Willie Apiata at 21 percent . Then Prime Minister John Key said he was not surprised by the poll , saying she is well thought of as a New Zealand Prime Minister .",
      "Forbes magazine ranked Clark the 22nd most powerful woman in the world in 2016 , down from 20th in 2006 .",
      "Post-premiership .",
      "Clark was the first defeated Labour Prime Minister to immediately resign the party leadership rather than lead it in Opposition . She served as the shadow foreign affairs spokesperson in the Shadow Cabinet of Phil Goff for several months before retiring from Parliament in April 2009 to accept a position with the United Nations ( UN ) .",
      "United Nations Development Programme .",
      "Clark became the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) on 17 April 2009 , and was the first woman to lead the organisation . She was also the Chair of the United Nations Development Group , a committee consisting of the heads of all UN funds , programmes and departments working on development issues . The New Zealand Government strongly supported her nomination , along with Australia , the Pacific Island nations and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Gordon Brown . She also received the support of the five countries on the bureau of the UNDP board ( Iran , Haiti , Serbia , The Netherlands and Tanzania ) and was unanimously confirmed by the General Assembly on 31 March . She was sworn in by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 27 April 2009 . In this position , Forbes deemed her the 23rd most powerful woman in the world .",
      "In 2013 , Forbes upgraded her position to 21st most powerful woman in the world after she was appointed to administer UNDP for a second term and for her potential future as UN Secretary General . She was the only New Zealander to make the list .",
      "Clark was recognised for her managerial style of leadership . During her tenure , she was an advocate of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative . She worked to reform the administration and bureaucracy of UNDP , with an emphasis on greater transparency in the organisation . The Publish What You Fund campaign ranked UNDP as the most transparent aid organisation in the world in 2015 and 2016 , under Clarks administration .",
      "In February 2015 , Clark visited Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone to express solidarity with those working to prevent the spread of Ebola .",
      "During her tenure , the ratio of women to men at UNDP reached 50% , including at the most senior level of the organisation .",
      "On 24 May 2016 , a Foreign Policy article alleged that Clarks tenure as Administrator had left a trail of embittered peers and subordinates , and accused her of undercutting the UNs promotion of human rights . The article centred on an allegation that her senior staff retaliated against a critical report of the UNDP by forcing out an official who had participated in the investigation . Both the UNDP and Clark have denied the claims .",
      "On 26 January 2017 , Clark announced that she would not seek re-election as UNDP Administrator after the completion of her four-year term . She said it had been an honour and privilege to have served in the role . She left UNDP on 19 April 2017 .",
      "United Nations Secretary-General selection .",
      "In January 2014 , a Guardian interview with Clark raised the possibility that she could take over as UN Secretary-General after Ban Ki-moons retirement in 2016 . She did not confirm her interest , but commented : There will be interest in whether the UN will have a first woman because theyre looking like the last bastions , as it were . She also said in the same interview that : If theres enough support for the style of leadership that I have , it will be interesting . In response , Prime Minister John Key said the New Zealand Government would support a bid , but cautioned that it would be a tough task to get the job .",
      "On 4 April 2016 , Helen Clark officially submitted her nomination as New Zealands candidate for the 2016 UN Secretary-General selection . In an interview on the same day , Clark stressed that she was running as the gender-neutral best candidate and not on the basis of being a woman .",
      "The UNs role in the Haiti cholera outbreak has been widely discussed and criticised . There has been indisputable evidence that the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti . Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal were carrying asymptomatic cholera and they did not treat their waste properly before dumping it into Haitis water stream . When asked about compensation for victims , Clark has declined to take a position , calling it legal issues .",
      "Another issue that received attention during Clarks candidacy was allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers . This gross problem was brought to light after Anders Kompass exposed the sexual assault of children by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic . During the United Nations Secretary General Candidate informal dialogues , Clark said that the UN needed to deal quickly with sexual exploitation and abuse , and gender-based violence by peacekeepers .",
      "Straw polls were taken by secret ballot in October 2016 . Clark finished fifth place in the sixth poll ; her candidacy was effectively vetoed when three of the permanent Security Council members voted against her .",
      "Clarks bid for Secretary-General is the topic of a documentary film , My Year With Helen , directed by Gaylene Preston , which premiered in February 2018 .",
      "World Health Organization .",
      "On 9 July 2020 the World Health Organization ( WHO ) appointed Clark as co-chair of a panel reviewing the WHOs handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response of governments to the outbreak . The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response ( IPPR ) examined how the outbreak occurred and how future pandemics can be prevented . She served in the role alongside former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , and of her appointment Clark said she hesitated before accepting because she felt the panels task was mission impossible . Clarks appointment to this panel drew criticism from UN Watchs Executive Director Hillel Neuer , who criticised her close ties with the pro-Beijing UN Goodwill Ambassador James Chau and her previous endorsement of Cuba for sending medical personnel abroad . On 11 November , Neuer called on Clark to resign , claiming that her alleged favouritism towards China and the WHO , would affect the investigation into Chinas handling of the COVID-19 pandemic . Clark responded that she had no ties with China .",
      "On 19 January , the independent panel concluded that Chinese officials could have moved faster in January 2020 to curb the initial COVID-19 outbreak , and criticised the WHO for not declaring an international emergency until 30 January 2020 . In the final report published in May 2021 , the panel concluded that the pandemic could have been prevented if countries had taken a more proactive approach in February 2020 ; Clark said so many countries chose to wait and see .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Clark was brought up as a Presbyterian Christian , attending Sunday school weekly . When she was Prime Minister she described herself as an agnostic .",
      "She married sociologist Peter Davis , her partner of five years in 1981 , shortly before she was elected to Parliament . Clark had been under pressure from some Labour members to marry for political purposes , despite her personal reservations about marriage . Davis is a professor in medical sociology and was director of COMPASS ( Centre of Methods and Policy Application in the Social Sciences ) at the University of Auckland .",
      "Clark , after the 1981 elections was to note : It was a difficult campaign , Clark wrote in an essay for the book Head and Shoulders in 1984 . As a single woman I was really hammered . I was accused of being a lesbian , of living in a commune , having friends who were Trotskyites and gays... .",
      "In March 2001 , Clark referred to National MP Wyatt Creech as a scumbag and a sleazeball for having raised the issue of a potential conflict of interest involving Davis , who was leading an academic research team studying government health reforms .",
      "Clark is a keen hiker and mountaineer . In August 2008 , an expedition group that included Clark and her husband became stranded on the Two Thumb Range , a spur of the Southern Alps , when their guide ( and Clarks friend ) , Gottlieb Braun-Elwert , collapsed and died from a suspected heart attack .",
      "Views and positions .",
      "Social media .",
      "During her tenure as UNDP administrator and afterwards , Clarks presence on social media and avid use of Twitter has attracted positive attention in news media . She has called for greater regulation of social media platforms , and supports the Christchurch Call .",
      "Cannabis reform .",
      "During the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum , Clark publicly supported the Yes vote campaign to decriminalise recreational cannabis , arguing that prohibition did not work . She also featured in the We Do campaign supporting the proposed Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill .",

      "Mart\u00edn de Gurrea y Arag\u00f3n",
      "Mart\u00edn de Gurrea y Arag\u00f3na ( 17 May 1525 - 25 April 1581 ) was a Spanish nobleman from a royal line descended from John II of Aragons son Alfonso . He was born and died in Pedrola . He was also notable as a collector and patron of the arts , commissioning artists such as Pablo Esquert .",
      "He inherited the title of Count of Ribagorza on his fathers death in 1550 . He also became 4th Duke of Villahermosa in 1558 when the 3rd Duke ( Fernando Sanseverino de Arag\u00f3n , prince of Salerno ) forfeited the title for supporting the King of France in Italy against the King of Spain .",
      "Family .",
      "The Dukedom of Villahermosa was created by John II of Aragon to recognise the military achievements of his illegitimate son by Leonor de Escobar , Alonso. : He was also made Count of Ribagorza . Alonso had an illegitimate son called John ( 1457-1528 ) , who was recognised by John II as his grandson to reward his mother Mar\u00eda Junquers , who had governed and defended Ribagorza in the counts absence .",
      "John was Count of Ribagorza , viceroy of Aragon and then viceroy of Naples ( 1507-1509 , in place of Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba ) , but he did not inherit the duchy of Villahermosa , which passed to the legitimate son Alfonso de Arag\u00f3n . John married the rich Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez de Gurrea , through whom he gained possession of Luna and Pedrola . After the marriage Johns descendants placed the surname Gurrea before that of Aragon . The couple had Alonso Felipe de Gurrea y Arag\u00f3n ( 1487-1550 ) , 3rd Count of Ribagorza , who married Isabel de Cardona y Enr\u00edquez de Qui\u00f1ones , from the powerful Catalan Cardona family . After he was widowed , he remarried to Ana de Sarmiento de Ulloa y Castilla , wealthy descendant of the marshals of Castille and holder of the state salt concessions - with her he had Mart\u00edn de Gurrea y Arag\u00f3n .",
      "Life .",
      "Mart\u00edn spent his early life in Pedrola , before being sent to Santiago de Compostela to be educated by his mothers brother cardinal Pedro G\u00f3mez Sarmiento , who educated him in Italian , Latin , ancient Greek and Hebrew . He then moved on to the court , where he served as minstrel to empress Isabel of Portugal and then page of the future Philip II of Spain as well as becoming friends with cardinal Granvelle . He also became friends with Philip , who he accompanied to England to marry Mary I and to Brussels in 1555 to witness Charles Vs abdication of his rule over the Low Countries . He divided his time between court and his estates at Pedrola .",
      "In 1557 , Mart\u00edn distinguished himself in the battle of St Quentin , gaining him royal favour . His personal fortune enabled him to pay for some of the political and diplomatic posts which followed , though he had to leave court to govern his possessions in Aragon after his wifes death in 1560 . Mart\u00edn remarried around 1542 to Luisa de Borja y Arag\u00f3n , from the family of the Dukes of Gand\u00eda and great-granddaughter of the Borgia pope Alexander VI . Luisa died after having eight children : Juan , Fernando , Ana , Mart\u00edn , Francisco , Mar\u00eda , In\u00e9s and Juana ( who died in infancy ) . All the children received a careful education , with Mart\u00edn and Francisco even going to the University of Salamanca , which was unusual for major noblemen of the time . The duke married a third time after her death , to Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez de Pomar in 1566 , with whom he had one child , Juliana . He also had two illegitimate daughters , Mar\u00eda and Gabriela .",
      "Rebellion in the County of Ribagorza faced a delicate situation muddied his relations with the court . On 6 June 1554 a court in Zamora took rights , rents and castles of the County out of Mart\u00edns hands and placed them directly back in royal control Mart\u00edn then took his case to the Justiciar of Aragon . On 6 May 1565 he passed the County of Ribagorza to his eldest son Juan de Gurrea y Arag\u00f3n , who he also betrothed to Luisa Pacheco Cabrera , daughter to the Count of Villena and Duke of Escalona . However , the wedding was delayed until 1569 by the lawsuit to regain control of the County , which eventually proved successful on 18 May 1567 . However , the crown had allowed the County to be misgoverned in the meantime and the damage proved irreversible . Years after Mart\u00edns death , the line of the Counts of Ribagorza died out and the territory passed back under direct royal rule .",
      "In 1571 his eldest son John was accused of murdering his wife . He escaped to Italy , but was captured and publicly executed there in 1573 at Torrej\u00f3n de Velasco . This meant Mart\u00edn re-assumed responsibility for the County of Ribagorza , meaning his courtly aspirations increasingly took a back seat Mart\u00edns final years were marked by the loss of several other loved ones - Philip IIs sister Joanna of Austria ( who Mart\u00edn had known as a child ) , Diego de Arnedo ( bishop of Huesca ) , John of Austria and Mart\u00edns own mother . In 1579 his friend the royal secretary Antonio P\u00e9rez was arrested . With these setbacks , Mart\u00edn became more and more religiously devout , finally dying in 1581 . The Duchy of Villahermosa , County of Ribagorza and his other titles were inherited by his son Fernando , who had married Juana de Pernstein y Manrique de Lara , lady-in-waiting to Maria of Austria .",
      "Patronage and cultural life .",
      "Thanks to his education , position and travels , Mart\u00edn formed part of the humanist and artistic circles of his era . His tutor cardinal Sarmiento taught him to love classical antiquity . He became a good friend of cardinal Granvelle , who he met at court early in his life as well as in Flanders and Aragon . Granvelle introduced him to artistic circles in Flanders and there he met painters such as Roland de Mois , who worked for the duke . He also shared his passion for coin-collecting with Antonio Agust\u00edn . He also joined the circle of the major Aragonese art-patron don Hernando de Arag\u00f3n , archbishop of Zaragoza , regent of Arag\u00f3n and ( like the Duke ) a grandson of Ferdinand the Catholic . He was also a friend of church humanists like Diego de Arnedo and Pedro Cerbuna .",
      "Martin also gathered a large art collection . Highlights included the set of portraits of the House of Villahermosa by Roland de Mois and the portrait of Mart\u00edn himself by the royal portraitist Antonio Moro . He was also given a painting entitled The Rape of Europa by its artist Titian . The collection also included works by Michelangelo , Hieronymus Bosch , Peter Brueghel the Elder and others . He left his collection to Pedrola and to the Monastery of Veruela , for which he felt a special affection . His collection of coins and medals was one of the first such collections in Spain and he wrote on them in his work Discursos sobre medallas y antig\u00fcedades .",
      "Marriages and issue .",
      "In 1542 married Luisa de Borja y Arag\u00f3n , with whom he had",

      "Stefan He\u00dfe is a German prelate of the Roman Catholic Church . He has been Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Hamburg since 26 January 2015 . The youngest bishop in Germany , he has often been outspoken on social and religious topics .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early life and priesthood .",
      "He\u00dfe was born in Cologne , Germany , on 7 August 1966 . Born to a family of bakers , he grew up in the citys Junkersdorf district . He attended George B\u00fcchner Gymnasium in Colognes Weiden district . After graduation in 1986 , he studied theology and philosophy at the University of Bonn and University of Regensburg .",
      "He\u00dfe was ordained on 18 June 1993 by Cardinal Joachim Meisner in the Cologne Cathedral . From 1993 to 1997 he was pastor at St . Remigius Church in the city of Bergheim . From 1997 to 2003 he was a lecturer at the Collegium Albertinum , a seminary in Bonn , while pursuing his doctorate . In 2001 he received his Doctor of Theology from the Philosophical-Theological School in Vallendar with a dissertation on Hans Urs van Balthasar , the Swiss Catholic theologian . From 2003 to 2005 he headed the Department of Pastoral Services of the Archdiocese of Cologne . Also in 2003 , he took up the additional position as the archdiocesan delegate for radio and television , a post he held until 2012 .",
      "On 1 May 2006 , He\u00dfe was appointed Deputy Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Cologne . On March 16 , 2012 , he became Vicar General .",
      "On 28 February 2014 , Cardinal Joachim Miesner , Archbishop of Cologne , resigned and He\u00dfe was elected diocesan administrator .",
      "On 20 September 2014 , Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki was installed as Archbishop of Cologne . At the ceremony , He\u00dfe was reaffirmed as Vicar General .",
      "Archbishop of Hamburg .",
      "On 26 January 2015 , Pope Francis appointed He\u00dfe the fourth Archbishop of Hamburg , following the retirement of Archbishop Werner Thissen in March 2014 . His episcopal consecration took place on 14 March 2015 , with his principal consecrator being Bishop of Osnabr\u00fcck Franz-Josef Hermann Bode . Co-consecrators were Archbishop of Cologne Cardinal Rainer Woelki and Norbert Werbs , Auxiliary Bishop of Hamburg . At 48 , he was Germanys youngest diocesan bishop .",
      "In a September 2015 plenary council , the gathering of German bishops and other clergy focused most of the discussion on the European migrant crisis that had begun earlier that year . The plenary elected He\u00dfe as the German bishops special envoy to the migrant crisis , which placed him in charge of the dioceses response efforts . Among the resources placed at his disposal were 100 million euros from Catholic dioceses and charities . which were set aside as aid for refugees both in and outside of Germany , and 800 unused church-owned buildings , which were designated as housing for migrants .",
      "On 18 March 2021 , after an investigation into the handling of accusations of sexual abuse on the part of priests in the Archdiocese of Cologne criticized He\u00dfe , he announced he was submitting his resignation to Pope Francis .",
      "Views .",
      "Environment and climate change .",
      "He\u00dfe commended Pope Francis second encyclical , Laudato si , which contains the pontiffs strong criticism for consumerism and irresponsible development and his lament for environmental degradation and global warming . In it , Francis calls for all people of the world to take swift and unified global action . He\u00dfe praised the encyclical , calling it valuable momentum for a worldwide ecological reorientation . He commented further , saying:He makes it clear that urgent issues of the future for the whole world and for all human beings have to be solved . Without a radical change of mentality this will not happen . Thus he underlines that the problems that concern all , can be solved only by all.In regard to the role of the Archdiocese of Hamburg , He\u00dfe said that we do not have many opportunities for development in this area , but the archdiocese had established an energy fund in 2009 containing eight million euros , five million of which had already been invested at that point . The funding was spent on 90 projects in 70 locations in the archdiocese , with efforts including the improvement of heating systems and insulation , and a shift to green electricity in parishes . The archbishop admitted that it was not satisfactory that only 25 out of around 80 parishes in the Archdiocese of Hamburg relied solely on green energy .",
      "Homosexuality and gay marriage .",
      "On 1 August 2015 , He\u00dfe called for the Catholic Church to be more realistic in regard to teachings on sexual morality . He said:We have to look upon the manifold ways and forms of living in which people live , as they now exist . Of course , [ I see ] same-sex couples entering the Metropolitan Cathedral of Hamburg , and nobody asking them to leave.Despite this , he said that he was still hesitant about homo-marriage . He made clear that the church needs to be available for all people , including gay people:When these people seek to be close to us , then we as Church are there for them . What else ? ...In my eyes , this does not minimize the love and fidelity between two people .",
      "Marriage and family life .",
      "In a May 2015 interview , He\u00dfe spoke about his views regarding marriage and families :",
      "I believe that freedom does not consist of me leaving everything open and free and undetermined , but instead , that I choose and commit myself . Analogously , that is also the case in marriage . ...I can\u2019t permanently keep all options open , but I am only happy when I can concretely commit myself to someone .",
      "When asked if he ever wished to marry and have children , He\u00dfe responded:I can imagine myself as a father . In all honesty , that was a topic during my studies.That was very clearly a question I had to ask myself . For me it is a comfort that I can also see myself as a husband or father . I would have found it harder if I had told myself , well , you\u2019re unsuited to be a father or husband , so you may as well be a priest .",
      "Divorce .",
      "In May 2015 , He\u00dfe stated his opinions on divorce in an interview , saying:In our understanding , I cannot get a divorce . Marriage exists until death separates the spouses . The idea is that I give myself fully and completely to a person and trust him or her fully and completely . That is a magnificent undertaking . I am happy that my parents are able to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary . Of course , I also know that marriages do fail.On 1 August 2015 , He\u00dfe announced that he wishes for remarried divorcees livable forms for the Churchs recognition and accompaniment , without giving up the ideal of marriage .",
      "Priestly celibacy .",
      "When asked in a May 2015 interview if celibacy is a disincentive for young men considering the priesthood , He\u00dfe responded:It is ; many young people object [ to it ] . For me , celibacy is more of a liberation and an expression that I put everything on this one card , namely God.When asked if celibacy was a relief for him , he said:Yes , because I believe freedom does not consist of me leaving everything open and free and undetermined , but instead that I choose and commit myself . Analogously , that is also the case in marriage .",
      "Pope Francis .",
      "In a May 2015 interview , He\u00dfe said that he thinks Pope Francis is a fascinating person , pioneering the way for the Church and todays world . Even evangelical Christians say , this is my Pope .",
      "Prayer .",
      "In a May 2015 interview with Norbert Vojta , He\u00dfe commented that one of the best forms of prayer for me is silence . When asked to elaborate , he stated that :",
      "Prayer is having a relationship with God . I cannot have a relationship with God when I talk nonstop . Sometimes , I see couples in love who are overjoyed , and just hug . ...I can retreat into silence , into my soul . This is one of the most important parts of prayer that only comes to me with time , and then I come to God .",
      "When asked how long he prayed every day , He\u00dfe said 30 seconds . The reporters were all astonished at his response , so he explained by saying but for those 30 seconds I have to prepare for half an hour .",
      "Church Labor Law reform .",
      "On 1 August 2015 , He\u00dfe defended recent reform of the Catholic Churchs Labor Law , and critiqued the position taken by some Bavarian bishops who have not fully implemented it , stating:Otherwise , we could not keep going , because we could not find enough qualified employees , in order to be able to run our institutions . I ask myself , what kind of image of the Church stands behind this ? Do we want to be a Church which has her place in the middle of the world ? Then , we have to be close to the life of the people , and we have to try to take along as many as possible . Or do we want , so to speak , a Church of the Pure , without existential difficulties and disruptions ? That indeed would then be a small , a very small crowdwhich only would have very few points of contact with its surrounding .",
      "Women ordination .",
      "In August 2020 , He\u00dfe supported ordination of women in Roman Catholic Church .",
      "Personal life .",
      "He\u00dfe is a fan of organ and classical music , and likes to attend concerts in the Laeiszhalle and the Elbe Philharmonic Hall .",
      "He admitted to not being a football ( soccer ) fan , humorously telling an interviewer , It would be the worst thing to pretend . That muse has not kissed me .",
      "Awards and honors .",
      "In 2005 He\u00dfe received the title Chaplain of His Holiness , and in 2010 , the title of Honorary Prelate ."

It was founded on 1 September 1954 as Technische Hochschule f\u00fcr Chemie Leuna-Merseburg ( THC ) and closed on 31 March 1993 . Hochschule Merseburg was founded on the grounds of THLM in 1992 .",
      "History .",
      "Technische Hochschule f\u00fcr Chemie Leuna-Merseburg was founded in a ceremony held in Halle ( Saale ) on 1 September 1954 . The first 207 students were registered on 19 October 1954 in the club house of Leuna chemical works , the mathematician Herbert Dallmann ( 1909\u20131996 ) was appointed as the first rector on this occasion , and the foundation stone of the Merseburg campus was laid . Despite the name of the new institution , it never had any facilities in Leuna ; the name only referred to the largest chemical plant in the GDR .",
      "The institution was founded with the aim of creating a Technische Hochschule ( TH ) that offered an application-oriented education in chemistry-related sciences and technology and supported the chemical industry in Central Germany . It can be regarded as a late consequence of the World Wars in the 20th century , and of the economical and political situation of the GDR that required an accelerated development of the industry . Several other institutions of tertiary education were founded at the same time .",
      "Originally intended to be located in Leipzig , the new TH was finally established in the smaller and quieter city of Merseburg , situated between two major chemical plants ( Leunawerke with ca . 30000 employees and Buna Werke Schkopau with ca . 20000 employees ) . It was originally attached to the Ministry of Heavy Industries , in December 1955 it was transferred to the newly founded Ministry of Chemical Industry and finally in February 1958 to the State Secretariat and later Ministry of Higher and Technical Education .",
      "Students accommodation was provided in dormitories on the campus or in a short distance thereof . Dormitory places not used by THLM students were used for students of the associated specialist Abitur classes or the Industrieinstitut ( which prepared industry workers without Abitur for studies at university level ) and also for younger staff members .",
      "A festival week was held every five years following the foundation of the THLM . On occasion of its tenth anniversary it was awarded the new name Technische Hochschule f\u00fcr Chemie \u201eCarl Schorlemmer\u201c Leuna-Merseburg by the Council of Ministers of the GDR , from 1975 on the name was shortened to Technische Hochschule \u201eCarl Schorlemmer\u201c Leuna-Merseburg .",
      "The library of THLM was the first in the new states of Germany after German Reunification that joined the data network Deutsches Wissenschaftsnetz founded in May 1990 . In November 1990 THLM became a member of German Rectors Conference . The government of Saxony-Anhalt decided in December 1990 to liquidate the institution . The result of an evaluation by the German Council of Science and Humanities in March 1991 was published in June . According to it , the departments of chemistry , process engineering and materials and processing technology were found to perform efficiently and competitively , and should join Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg ( MLU ) . Integration was completed in 1993 , when the employees of THLM became employees of MLU . Closure of THLM was",

      "62nd Fighter Squadron",
      "The 62d Fighter Squadron is part of the United States Air Force 56th Operations Group at Luke Air Force Base , Arizona . It operates the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II aircraft conducting advanced fighter training .",
      "Mission .",
      "The 62d Fighter Squadron ( Spikes , Tailband : White & Blue ) operates the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II , conducting pilot training for active duty USAF pilots .",
      "History .",
      "World War II .",
      "The 62d Fighter Squadron was activated as the 62d Pursuit Squadron , one of the original three squadrons of the 56th Pursuit Group at Army Air Base Savannah , Georgia , on 15 January 1941 . The squadron immediately began training for its wartime missions under III Fighter Command , rapidly transitioning through the Seversky P-35 , Curtiss P-36 , Bell P-39 Airacobra , and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk aircraft . On 7 December 1941 , the 62d stepped up to defend the Northeastern United States from anticipated enemy air attack while it converted to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and prepared to deploy overseas , operating under the I Fighter Command , New York Fighter Wing in the early months of 1942 .",
      "It was redesignated 62d Fighter Squadron on 15 May 1942 , and deployed to RAF Kings Cliffe , England on 9 January 1943 . It was declared operationally ready two months later and flew its first combat missions 13 April . The squadron was given fuselage code LM and operated from several RAF stations during the war , flying the P-47 Thunderbolt as an VIII Fighter Command bomber-escort unit for Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and beginning in 1944 for Consolidated B-24 Liberators attacking enemy targets in Occupied Europe . After the end of the war in Europe , the squadron was inactivated on 18 October 1945 .",
      "Strategic Fighter Escort Squadron .",
      "The squadron was reactivated on 1 May 1946 as a Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) escort fighter group , being assigned to Fifteenth Air Force at Selfridge Field , Michigan , equipped with long-range North American P-51H Mustangs that had been developed for Twentieth Air Force bomber escort missions in the Pacific Theater . The mission of the squadron was to provide fighter escort of SACs Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers on intercontinental strategic bombardment missions , deploying to Alaska and Europe in this role . In 1947 , the squadron was upgraded to Lockheed P-80C Shooting Stars , as SAC introduced the Boeing B-50 Superfortress in the late 1940s . The squadron trained to maintain proficiency as a mobile strike force ; including bomber escort mission until transferred from Strategic Air Command to Continental Air Command on 1 December 1948 .",
      "Air Defense Command .",
      "The squadron began performing air defense missions in 1950 with its relocation to OHare International Airport , Chicago in 1950 . It was redesignated as the 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 20 January 1950 , and re-equipped with the North American F-86D Sabre . It was assigned to Air Defense Command 4706th Defense Wing in February 1952 . In 1955 , the 56th was reactivated under ADC as an Air Defense Group with the 62d being a tactical interceptor squadron .",
      "In 1959 with interceptors being moved from OHare the squadron moved to K.I . Sawyer Air Force Base , Michigan , and the 62d was re-equipped with the Mach 2+ McDonnell F-101B Voodoo two-seat interceptor . The F-101B proved to be a quite successful interceptor . assigned alongside the F-101B interceptor was the F-101F operational and conversion trainer . The two-seat trainer version was equipped with dual controls , but carried the same armament as the F-101B and were fully combat-capable .",
      "The squadron maintained alert against the ever-present Soviet bomber threat .",
      "On 22 October 1962 , before President John F . Kennedy told Americans that missiles were in place in Cuba , the squadron dispersed one third of its force , equipped with nuclear tipped missiles to Phelps Collins Air National Guard Base at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis . These planes returned to K.I . Sawyer after the crisis .",
      "A highlight from this era was the squadron capturing top F-101 squadron honors at the William Tell 1965 , USAF Worldwide Weapons Meet . The squadron maintained the air defense alert until it was inactivated on 30 April 1970 , with its aircraft being passed along to the Air National Guard . The 62d was the last active-duty squadron equipped with the F-101B . The squadron was replaced by the 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron flying Convair F-106A Delta Darts",
      "Tactical Air Command .",
      "On 1 September 1974 , the 62d was reactivated at Tyndall Air Force Base , Florida , as a fighter training unit . The squadron assumed the mission of training McDonnell F-4E Phantom II and Convair F-106 Delta Dart weapons instructors at the United States Air Force Interceptor Weapons School . The following October , the squadron moved again , this time to rejoin the 56th Tactical Fighter Wing at MacDill Air Force Base , Florida , and began training F-4 crews for tactical units around the world . 62d aircraft carried a blue fin cap , tail coded MC . In April 1978 , the squadron changed equipment to the F-4D , with the E models being transferred to operational squadrons .",
      "The last F-4D flight occurred on 14 November 1980 , and conversion began to the General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon began that month . On 1 January 1981 , the squadron transitioned to the Fighting Falcon and the squadron was redesignated as the 62d Tactical Fighter Training Squadron . Beginning in June 1989 the unit converted to the Block 30 model of the F-16C and F-16D . On 1 November 1991 the squadron was once again redesignated back to what it was in World War II as the 62d Fighter Squadron with the adoption of the objective organization plan by the wing .",
      "Move and transfer to training command .",
      "With the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s it was announced that MacDill would close . The squadrons of the 56th Fighter Wing would be inactivated starting with the 72d Fighter Squadron sequentially from the highest numbered to the lowest , the 61st Fighter Squadron . Therefore , the 62d Fighter Squadron was second to last to inactivate . The squadron , however , continued to train fighter pilots until its inactivation on 12 May 1993 to prepare for the move to Luke Air Force Base , Arizona where it would continue as an F-16 training squadron .",
      "The squadron was able to reactivate at Luke on 18 March 1994 . Pilot training for students assigned to the 62d is a standard syllabus , one that gets students their first look at the F-16 and prepare them for service with active duty units . The squadrons mission is to Graduate flight pilots who meet or exceed syllabus standards and their gaining units expectations . Teach the B-course students what it means to be a fighter pilot . Actively promote quality of life and provide opportunities for personal and professional growth .",

      "London Fire Brigade",
      "The London Fire Brigade ( LFB ) is the fire and rescue service for London . It was formed by the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act 1865 , under the leadership of superintendent Eyre Massey Shaw .",
      "The LFB is the busiest of all the fire services in the United Kingdom . It is the second largest in size , after the national Scottish Fire and Rescue Service , and has the largest number of full-time firefighters . It has 5,992 staff , including 5,096 operational firefighters and officers based at 102 fire stations ( plus one river station ) .",
      "The LFB is led by the Commissioner for Fire and Emergency Planning , Andy Roe . The brigade and Commissioner are overseen by the Greater London Authority , which in April 2018 took over these responsibilities from the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority ( LFEPA ) .",
      "In the 2015-16 financial year the LFB received 171,488 emergency calls . These consisted of : 20,773 fires , 48,696 false alarms of fire and 30,066 other calls for service . As well as firefighting , the LFB also responds to road traffic collisions , floods , shut-in-lift releases , and other incidents such as those involving hazardous materials or major transport accidents . It also conducts emergency planning and performs fire safety inspections and education . It does not provide an ambulance service as this function is performed by the London Ambulance Service as an independent NHS trust , although all LFB firefighters are trained in first aid and all of its fire engines carry first aid equipment . Since 2016 , the LFB has provided first aid for some life-threatening medical emergencies ( e.g . cardiac or respiratory arrest ) .",
      "History .",
      "Following a multitude of ad-hoc firefighting arrangements and the Great Fire of London , various insurance companies established firefighting units to tackle fires that occurred in buildings that their respective companies insured . As demands grew on the primitive firefighting units they began to coordinate and co-operate with each other until , on 1 January 1833 , the London Fire Engine Establishment was formed under the leadership of James Braidwood , who had founded the first professional , municipal fire brigade in Edinburgh . He introduced a uniform that , for the first time , included personal protection from the hazards of firefighting . With 80 firefighters and 13 fire stations , the unit was still a private enterprise , funded by the insurance companies and as such was responsible mainly for saving material goods from fire .",
      "Several large fires , most notably at the Palace of Westminster in 1834 and the 1861 Tooley Street fire ( in which Braidwood died in action , aged 61 ) , spurred the insurance companies to lobby the British government to provide the brigade at public expense and management . After due consideration , in 1865 the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act was passed , creating the Metropolitan Fire Brigade under the leadership of Eyre Massey Shaw , a former head of police and fire services in Belfast . In 1904 it was renamed as the London Fire Brigade . The LFB moved into a new headquarters built by Higgs and Hill on the Albert Embankment in Lambeth in 1937 , where it remained until 2007 .",
      "During the Second World War the countrys brigades were amalgamated into a single National Fire Service . The separate London Fire Brigade for the County of London was re-established in 1948 . With the formation of Greater London in 1965 , this absorbed most of the Middlesex Fire Brigade , the borough brigades for West Ham , East Ham and Croydon and parts of the Essex , Hertfordshire , Surrey and Kent brigades .",
      "In 1986 the Greater London Council ( GLC ) was disbanded and a new statutory authority , the London Fire and Civil Defence Authority ( LFCDA ) , was formed to take responsibility for the LFB . The LFCDA was replaced in 2000 by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority . At the same time , the Greater London Authority ( GLA ) was established to administer the LFEPA and coordinate emergency planning for London . Consisting of the Mayor of London and other elected members , the GLA also takes responsibility for the Metropolitan Police Service , Transport for London and other functions .",
      "In 2007 the LFB vacated its Lambeth headquarters and moved to a site in Union Street , Southwark . In the same year , the Department for Communities and Local Government announced that LFB Commissioner Ken Knight had been appointed as the first Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser to the government . Knight was succeeded as Commissioner at that time by Ron Dobson , who served for almost ten years . Dany Cotton took over in 2017 , becoming the brigades first female commissioner .",
      "Commissioners and chief officers .",
      "As of 1 January 2020 Andy Roe is the commissioner of the LFB . He succeeds Dany Cotton , who in 2017 had become the first woman to hold the top role ; Cotton resigned in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire after 32 years service in the brigade . Prior to Cotton , Ron Dobson was the commissioner and he had served in the LFB since 1979 ; he was awarded a CBE for his distinguished contribution to the fire service .",

      "Organisation .",
      "Historically , the London Fire Brigade was organised into two divisions : Northern and Southern , divided in most places by the River Thames and each commanded by a Divisional Officer . Both divisions were divided into three districts , each under a Superintendent with his headquarters at a superintendent station . The superintendent stations themselves were commanded by District Officers , with the other stations under Station Officers .",
      "On the creation of the Greater London Council in 1965 , the brigade was enlarged and took over almost all of the Middlesex Fire Brigade , part of west Kent , North Surrey and South West Essex , together with the small County Borough brigades of Croydon , East Ham and West Ham .",
      "The internal LFB organisation consists of three directorates that all report to the Commissioner . They are :",
      "- Operations ;",
      "- Safety and Assurance ;",
      "- Finance and Contractual Services .",
      "The LFBs headquarters since 2007 is located in Union Street in Southwark , adjacent to the brigades former training centre , which was both the original headquarters of the Massey Shaw fire brigade and his home , Winchester House , as well as the London Fire Brigade Museum . The brigade was previously headquartered in Lambeth between 1937 and 2007 .",

      "Fire and rescue authorities in England come under the government department formerly known as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister ( ODPM ) . This department was responsible for legislation covering fire authorities ; however , in 2006 , a structural change to central government led to the creation of the Department for Communities and Local Government ( DCLG ) , and subsequently the Ministry of Housing , Communities and Local Government ( MHCLG ) . It is now responsible for fire and resilience in England , including London .",
      "The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 changed many working practices ; it was brought in to replace the Fire Services Act 1947 and repealed several existing acts , many going back fifty years . The full list of acts repealed can be found here :",
      "The 2004 Act was drafted in response to the Independent Review of the Fire Service , often referred to as the Bain Report , after its author Professor Sir George Bain . It recommended radical changes to many working procedures and led to a national firefighter strike in 2002\u20132003 .",
      "Further changes to the legislative , organisational and structural fabric of the brigade , which could include varying the attendance time , the location of frontline appliances and number of personnel , plus mandatory performance targets , priorities and objectives are set by the MHCLG in the form of a document called the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework . The framework is set annually by the government and applies to all brigades in England . Responsibility for the rest of the UK fire service is devolved to the various parliaments and assemblies . On country-wide issues , the Chief Fire Officers Association provides the collective voice on fire , rescue and resilience issues . Membership is made up from senior officers above the rank of Assistant Chief Officer , to Chief Fire Officer ( or the new title of Brigade Manager ) .",
      "Staffing .",
      "Rank structure .",
      "London Fire Brigade , along with many UK fire and rescue services , adopted a change in rank structure in 2006 . The traditional ranks were replaced with new titles descriptive of the job function .",
      "On 17 October 2019 , London Fire Brigade announced a return to the traditional rank titles , in a policy named Role to Rank . The rank structure of the Brigade is now as in the following table :",
      "Recruitment and training .",
      "In the last 24 months , the LFB have run three firefighter recruitment campaigns , however in previous years have seen fewer or even none . There are many factors as to why they would run a recruitment drive , as there is actually no set recruitment drive for firefighters .",
      "Professional firefighter training usually takes place at various London venues . On successful completion , the newly qualified firefighter is posted to a fire station to work on a shift pattern currently two day shifts ( ten and half hours ) , followed by two night shifts ( thirteen and half hours ) , followed by four days off . Working patterns were the subject of scrutiny in Professor Bains Independent Review of the Fire Service .",
      "After training school , firefighters serve a one-year period of probation ; qualification and full pay are not reached until the candidate completes a development folder which usually takes around 12\u201318 months . Ongoing training both theoretical and practical continues throughout the firefighters career .",
      "Shift pattern .",
      "In December 2010 the LFB and Fire Brigades Union ( FBU ) agreed on a new shift pattern for front-line firefighters : two 10\u00bd-hour day shifts then two 13\u00bd-hour night shifts followed by four days off .",
      "The agreement followed two 8-hour daytime strikes by the FBU in protest at the LFBs intention to change the shift pattern from two 9-hour day shifts then two 15-hour night shifts followed by three days off , to two 12-hour day shifts then two 12-hour night shifts followed by four days off .",
      "A London Fire Brigade report published in March 2012 stated that the shift changes have improved safety in the city . Compared with the 12 months prior to the shift changes , the 12 months following them saw firefighters able to spend more time on training , community safety work , and home safety visits ( including the free fitting of smoke alarms ) .",
      "Promotion .",
      "In order for a firefighter to gain promotion he or she must go through an assessment centre and reach the required standard set out by the Brigade . This process will be followed for each subsequent role the individual applies for , up to and including Assistant Commissioner . Appointments above the role of Assistant Commissioner are overseen by elected members of The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority .",
      "Some promotion exams can be substituted by qualifications from the Institution of Fire Engineers . Firefighters and civilians such as building inspectors , scientists , surveyors and other practising professionals , take these qualifications either by written test or research .",
      "Future promotion exams will be set using the Integrated Personal Development System ( IPDS ) .",
      "Firefighting , special services and fire prevention .",
      "In 2010/11 , the LFB handled a total of 212,657 emergency calls , including 5,241 hoax calls ( although it only mobilised to 2,248 of those malicious false alarms ) . During the same period , it dealt with 13,367 major fires . There were 6,731 dwelling fires , including 748 that had been started deliberately ; 73 people died in 58 fatal fires .",
      "In addition to conflagrations , LFB firefighters respond to special services .",
      "A special service is defined as every other non-fire related emergency , such as:<ref",
      "- Lift releases ( 9,395 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Effecting entry/exit ( 7,276 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Flooding ( 6,956 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Traffic collisions ( 3,604 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Spills and leaks ( 1,479 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Assisting other agencies ( 855 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Making safe operations ( 782 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Animal rescues ( 583 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Hazardous materials incidents ( 353 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- General evacuations ( 322 in 2010/11 ) ;",
      "- Suicides or attempts ( 229 in 2010/11 ) ; and",
      "- Waterborne rescues ( 38 in 2010/11 ) .",
      "The full scope of the brigades duties and powers is enshrined in the Fire and Rescue Act 2005 .",
      "Firefighters and , in some cases , specialist teams from the brigades fire investigation unit , based at Dowgate , also investigate arson incidents , often working alongside the police and providing evidence in court . In 2008/09 , deliberate fires accounted for 28% of all those attended by the LFB , a 28% reduction on the previous year .",
      "The other core duty of the brigade is to prevent damage , and day-to-day fire prevention duties .",
      "Firefighting cover .",
      "The LFB provides fire cover according to a system of four risk categories which have traditionally been used across the UK , where every building is rated for its risk on a scale from A down to D . The risk category determines the minimum number of appliances to be sent in a pre-determined mobilisation .",
      "Category A includes areas with a high density of large buildings and/or population , such as offices or factories . Three fire engines are to arrive at A risks within eight minutes , the first two within five minutes .",
      "Areas with a medium density of large buildings and/or population , such as multi-storey residential blocks , will generally be classified B risk . Two fire engines will be deployed , with one to arrive within five minutes and the second within eight minutes .",
      "Category C covers lower density , suburban areas and detached properties . One fire engine should arrive at a C risk incident within ten minutes . More rural areas not covered by the first three categories will be considered D risk . One fire engine should arrive at D risks within 20 minutes .",
      "Response times .",
      "In 2007/08 , the first fire engine mobilised to a 999 call arrived within five minutes 58.8% of the time , and within eight minutes 90% of the time . The second fire engine deployed arrived within eight minutes 81.9% of the time , and within ten minutes 92.4% of the time .",
      "In 2010/11 , the average response time of the first appliance to the scene was 5 minutes 34 seconds ( 6 minute target ) , and the second appliance was 6 minutes 53 seconds ( 8 minute target ) .",
      "In 2015/16 , the average response time for the first appliance to the scene was 5 minutes 33 seconds ( 6 minute target ) , and the second appliance to the scene was 6 minutes 55 seconds ( 8 minute target ) .",
      "Mutual assistance .",
      "The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 gives the UK fire services the ability to call upon other services or fire authorities in what is known as mutual assistance . For example , the LFB played a comprehensive role in assisting Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service at the Buncefield fire in 2005 . Much earlier , the Hampton Court fire of 1986 , which was on the border with Surrey , was attended by both the LFB and Surrey Fire and Rescue Service .",
      "In 2015/16 the LFB assisted at 567 over the border incidents .",
      "The other fire services that adjoin the LFB are :",
      "- Essex County Fire and Rescue Service",
      "- Kent Fire and Rescue Service",
      "- Surrey Fire and Rescue Service",
      "- Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service",
      "- Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service",
      "- Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service",
      "The LFB also mobilises to support airport firefighters at London Heathrow Airport , London City Airport and The London Heliport .",
      "Determining the size of an incident .",
      "The LFB , along with all other UK fire and rescue services , determines the size of a fire or special service by the final number of appliances mobilised to deal with it . For example , two appliances are despatched to a B risk area in response to a fire call in a residential house . The officer-in-charge can request additional appliances by transmitting a radio message such as , make pumps four , or if persons are believed to be involved or trapped , make pumps four , persons reported . The control room will then deploy a further two appliances making a total of four . Informally , firefighters refer to such fires as a make up or a four-pumper ;",
      "If an incident is more serious , it can be escalated straight to a six- , eight- or ten-pump fire and beyond in London this is usually completed in even numbers , though it is not uncommon for a ten-pump fire to be made up to 15 if necessary . A call to , say , a large warehouse ablaze could be escalated straight to a ten-pump fire . The 2007 Cutty Sark fire required eight pumps ; as a serious incident escalates , the brigade deploys senior officers , Command Units and any specialist appliances required .",
      "Examples of 25-pump fires include the blaze at Alexandra Palace in 1980 , and at the Royal Marsden Hospital , Chelsea in 2008 , the latter also involving four aerial appliances . The Kings Cross fire in 1987 was a 30-pump fire , as was the blaze in numerous shops on Oxford Street in April 2007 . The Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 was a 40-pump fire .",
      "Pumping appliances can only operate with a minimum crew of four , and a maximum of six ( although this is rare ) so it is possible to estimate the number of firefighters attending an incident by multiplying the number of pumps by five . For example , the Cutty Sark fire was described as an eight-pump fire attended by 40 firefighters .",
      "Special services .",
      "Core services are paid for by Londons council tax payers and through central government funding known as a grant settlement ; each council tax payers bill will include a precept \u2013 a specific part of their bill that contributes to the funding of the fire brigade . Those in need of the LFBs services in an emergency do not pay , but the brigade can provide additional special services for which it may charge where there is no immediate threat to life or imminent risk of injury .",
      "Examples of these special services which may be charged for include the clearing of flooded commercial premises , the use of brigade equipment for supplying or removing water , and making structures safe in cases where there is no risk of personal injury to the public .",
      "Safety and fire prevention .",
      "LFB firefighters and watch officers often visit residential and commercial premises to advise on hazard risk assessment and fire prevention . They also provide safety education to schools and youth groups . Each of the London boroughs has a central fire safety office that collates and coordinates fire prevention work in accordance with legislation , and they are supported by a dedicated team of specialist officers .",
      "In 2010/11 , the LFB made 70,016 home fire safety visits . Over 100,000 children are seen each year by the brigades schools team . Around half of all serious fires occur in the home , and many house fires attended by the LFB no smoke alarm was fitted , despite the LFB fitting tens of thousands in homes every year .",
      "Stations and equipment .",
      "As of 2014 , the LFB has 103 fire stations , including one river station , across the 32 London boroughs and the City of London . They are staffed 24 hours a day by full-time employees of the brigade , and are linked to a control centre in Merton . This centre was opened in 2012 ; calls to it are fed from 999 operators at BT , Cable & Wireless and Global Crossing .",
      "Central London stations can attend up to 8,000 calls per year , inner-city stations about 3,000 to 4,000 calls per year ( these tend to be the stations that are busy serving the densely populated areas ) , and outlying or suburban fire stations may attend around 1,500 calls which include road traffic accidents , grass fires and house fires .",
      "Some UK fire authorities use retained ( part-time ) firefighters who live and work near their local station and are on-call , but the LFB is one of only three UK fire services where all operational staff are full-time employees .",
      "Each station has four shifts , or watches : red , white , blue and green , with a Sub Officer ( single appliance stations ) or Station Officer ( multi appliance stations ) in charge of each . The overall management of the station falls to the Station Commander , who will also attend serious incidents , as well as spending time on call .",
      "A group of one ( City of London ) to five ( Tower Hamlets ) stations within a borough are managed by a Borough Commander ( Group Commander ) who interacts strategically on a local level with the Borough Commander for the police and ambulance services and the chief executive of the local authority .",
      "Stations and districts .",
      "Upon the founding of the London County Council in 1965 , the new authority was organised into 11 divisions , of roughly 10 to 12 stations each , designated A Division through to L Division , dispatched by three 999 mobilising control rooms . A ( West End ) , D ( West London ) , G ( North West London ) and J ( North London ) mobilised from Wembley ( the former Middlesex headquarters ) ; B ( Central London south of the river ) , E ( South East London and Kent ) , H ( South London and Surrey ) and K ( South West London south of the river and Surrey ) mobilised from Croydon ( the former Croydon County Borough headquarters ) ; finally , C ( City and Inner East London ) , F ( East London including Docklands ) and L ( North East London and South West Essex ) , mobilised from Stratford ( the former West Ham County Borough headquarters ) . Each of these divisions were , to a degree , autonomous of each other and had their own divisional management hierarchy . This arrangement lasted until 1989 when the brigade was re-organised into the current arrangement .",
      "The LFB is currently formed into five divisions : Northern , Eastern , Western , Southeastern and Southwestern . As of 2013 , 21 fire stations were located in the Northern Division and have call signs prefixed A ; 26 were in the Eastern Division with call signs prefixed F ; Western Division consisted of 21 stations with G-prefixed call signs ; 22 were under the Southeastern Division with an E prefix ; and the remaining 22 were based in the Southwestern Division , call signs prefixed H . As part of this organisation , many stations were re-coded .",
      "Below is a complete listing , as of 2014 , of the 102 fire stations of the London Fire Brigade according to district and station radio callsign . The LFB is divided into five districts , each designated by a letter of the alphabet : the Northern District Command is designated as A ; the Southeastern District Command is designated as E ; the Eastern District Command is designated as F ; the Western District Command is designated as G ; the Southwestern District Command is designated as H .",
      "- Northern District",
      "The Northern District Command is designated as A or Alpha . There are currently 17 fire stations in the Northern District . The Northern District serves the following boroughs of London : Barnet , Camden , Enfield , Haringey , Islington , the City of Westminster and the City of London .",
      "- Southeastern District",
      "The Southeastern District Command is designated as E or Echo . There are currently 19 fire stations in the Southeastern District . The Southeastern District serves the following boroughs of London : Bexley , Bromley , Greenwich , Lewisham , and Southwark .",
      "- Eastern District",
      "The Eastern District Command is designated as F or Foxtrot . There are currently 23 fire stations in the Eastern District . The Eastern District serves the following boroughs of London : Barking and Dagenham , Hackney",
      ", Havering , Newham , Redbridge , Tower Hamlets , and Waltham Forest .",
      "- Western District",
      "The Western District Command is designated as G or Golf . There are currently 21 fire stations in the Western District . The Western District serves the following boroughs of London : Brent , Ealing , Hammersmith and Fulham , Harrow , Hillingdon , Hounslow , and Kensington and Chelsea .",
      "- Southwestern District",
      "The Southwestern District Command is designated as H or Hotel . There are currently 22 fire stations in the Southwestern District , including the independent River Station , the quarters of the Fireboat . The Southwestern District serves the following boroughs of London : Croydon , Kingston upon Thames , Lambeth , Merton , Richmond upon Thames , Sutton , and Wandsworth .",
      "Appliances .",
      "All 102 LFB stations ( not counting the river station ) have a conventional fire appliance known as a dual pump ladder . Around 55 stations are also assigned one additional pump . Numerous other stations are home to a range of other specialist vehicles .",
      "The stations that are assigned both a dual pump ladder and a pump are generally the busier stations receiving over 2,000 emergency calls ( known colloquially by firefighters as shouts ) per year . They may also be stations of strategic importance , or those located in areas considered to be high risk . The remaining stations equipped with a single pump ladder generally attend fewer than 2,000 calls per year .",
      "An earlier fleet of mostly Volvo vehicles was phased out , with some retained for training and reserve purposes , and replaced between 2002 and 2011 with new Mercedes-Benz vehicles .",
      "In 2012 , the LFB purchased five Mini Countrymans for conversion into instant response vehicles . The two-seat cars are fitted with six extinguishers ( two each of water , foam and powder ) , plus a first-aid kit and defibrillator , and may be deployed to investigate automatic alarms actuating and smaller fires such as those in rubbish bins which do not require a full-sized engine and crew . The brigade has indicated a wish to add more smaller vehicles to its fleet , including crossover utility vehicles which could be fitted with water pumps , breathing apparatus and pull-out equipment drawers , and with enough space for four firefighters .",
      "In 2016 , the LFB announced they would be replacing the older-generation ( currently used ) Mercedes-Benz Atego pump appliances with brand new Mercedes-Benz Ategos which include new features such as : an improved crew cab for the comfort and safety of firefighters , new high-pressure hoses which can deliver twice as much water as previous models , a brand new electronically controlled pump , and a more economical and environment-friendly EURO VI engine , which will be compatible with Londons low-emission zones . In 2017 , 52 initial appliance orders are being rolled out across London ready for operational use , replacing the older 2002-2004 pumps , and later replacing the newer 2006-2008 pumps . The primary reason for the replacement of the older Ategos was due to their age ( some being 15 years old ) and poor economy .",
      "As of 2016 , the LFBs frontline operational fleet consists of :",
      "- Approximately 100 Dual Pump Ladders ( DPL ) ( plus approximately 25 used for training )",
      "- Approximately 50 Pumps ( P )",
      "- 15 Fire Rescue Units ( FRU ) ( plus 1 for training )",
      "- 14 Urban Search and Rescue ( USAR ) multi-purpose vehicles",
      "- 8 Incident Response Units ( IRU )",
      "- 8 Command Support Units ( CSU )",
      "- 7 Aerial Ladder Platforms ( ALP )",
      "- 6 Operational Support Units ( OSU )",
      "- 6 High-volume Pumps ( HVP )",
      "- 6 Fire Investigation Units ( FIU )",
      "- 5 Instant Response Vehicles ( IRV )",
      "- 4 Turntable Ladders ( TL )",
      "- 4 Hose Laying Units ( HLU )",
      "- 3 Bulk Foam Units ( BFU )",
      "- 2 Scientific Support Units ( SSU )",
      "- 2 Detection , Identification , and Monitoring Units ( DIM )",
      "- 1 All-terrain Pump",
      "- 1 Heavy Distribution Unit ( HDU )",
      "- 1 Fire Investigation Dog Unit ( FID )",
      "- 1 Fireboat ( plus 1 used as a reserve and for training )",
      "Improvements .",
      "The programme of improvements in staffing and equipment undertaken by the LFB since the September 11 attacks to improve Londons resilience and its capability to deal with major emergencies , including the threat of terrorism has included : ten Incident Response Units ; two Scientific Support Units ; four different types of urban search and rescue ( USAR ) vehicles and ten USAR personnel carriers ; three mass decontamination resilience units ; and six equipment carriers known as Operational Support Units .",
      "Architecturally , fire stations vary in age and design from Edwardian era red-brick fire houses to modern spacious blocks complete with additional specialist facilities . Early fire stations were originally built with horse-drawn appliances in mind and with traditional features such as the firemans pole , used by firefighters to gain rapid access from their upstairs quarters to the fire engine garages below when summoned .",
      "More modern fire stations , though constructed without such features , often have more spacious accommodation and facilities for staff of both sexes , public visitor areas such as community safety offices and other amenities . An example of these is the new fire station in Hammersmith which opened in 2003 , just a few hundred yards along Shepherds Bush Road from the previous local fire station which had been constructed in 1913 .",
      "Modernisation .",
      "In 2008 , existing LFB facilities were deemed unsuitable to meet the demands of modern firefighting and training . The LFB had been training firefighters at its current Grade 2 listed building in Southwark since 1878 .",
      "In response , the LFB signed a partnership contract with Babcock International Group PLC to provide firefighter training over the course of 25 years beginning in 2012 . Babcock is also the number one training provider to the Royal Navy , which includes firefighter training . The improvement program for firefighting training will introduce two new dedicated training centres and upgrades to 10 regional training centres . There will also be further improvements through additional computers and training facilities across many of the capitals 103 fire stations . The new firefighting training systems , supplied by Process Combustion Ltd , will have low environmental impact and will allow firefighter training to take place at night under simulated extreme conditions that firefighters will face on incident ground . In addition to improving training facilities , Babcocks proposals will increase the amount of time available for firefighter training and save the LFB an estimated \u00a366m over the next 25 years .",
      "Fire station closures .",
      "The creation of the Greater London Council in 1965 saw the number of LFB stations increase . The LFB absorbed some stations from the county brigades . At the time there were a handful of smaller brigades : Middlesex , Croydon , West Ham and East Ham \u2013 they were all incorporated into the LFB . By 1965 the LFB had 115 stations , plus two river stations .",
      "The LFB has an ongoing policy of upgrading existing fire stations , and building new stations to replace those that are no longer suitable for the requirements of a modern-day fire service . In February 2010 , the Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , officially opened the LFBs first new station in four years , at Harold Hill . The mayor hailed the stations exceptional environmental sustainability , calling it the greenest station in the capital . In the past two decades the total number of stations has reduced slightly , with the following permanent closures , including 10 in January 2014 as part of budget cuts :",
      "- 2014 : Belsize ( A42 ) , Bow ( F27 ) , Clerkenwell ( A27 ) , Downham ( E32 ) , Kingsland ( F31 ) , Knightsbridge ( A26 ) , Silvertown ( F46 ) , Southwark ( E33 ) , Westminster ( A25 ) , and Woolwich ( E24 ) .",
      "- 2005 : Manchester Square ( A22 )",
      "- 1999 : Barbican ( A29 )",
      "- 1998 : Heathrow Airport ( new station subsequently opened when the central terminal area was re-classified as A risk )",
      "- 1998 : Shooters Hill ( E26 )",
      "- 1993 : Sanderstead ( H30 ) ( originally a Surrey Fire Brigade station )",
      "Regional control centre .",
      "In October 2007 , the Department for Communities and Local Government ( DCLG ) announced that the location for the new regional control centre , dedicated to the capital and part of the FiReControl project , would be at the Merton industrial estate in the London Borough of Merton . FiReControl was however scrapped in 2010 .",
      "Major or notable incidents .",
      "The geographical area covered by the LFB along with the major transport infrastructure and the political , business and administrative bases typical of a capital city has seen the brigade involved in many significant incidents .",
      "Major incident procedure .",
      "A major incident is defined as any emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or more of Londons emergency services and will generally include the involvement , either directly or indirectly , of large numbers of people .",
      "Any member of any of the emergency services can initiate a major incident . Responsibility for the rescue of persons involved lies with the LFB . The care and transportation of casualties to hospital is the responsibility of the London Ambulance Service . Police will ease these operations by co-ordinating the emergency services , local authorities and other agencies .",
      "When a major incident is declared the services , along with civilian agencies , use a structural system known as gold-silver-bronze command that allows them to follow a set procedure for incident management . Put simply , gold relates to strategic control of an incident , silver to tactical command , and bronze to operational control . The term gold command can also relate to an emergency service building , mobile control unit or other base that becomes the focal point ( often remotely ) for the incidents management .",
      "Additionally , a major incident can lead to the government activating its coordination facility , known as COBR .",
      "Notable incidents .",
      "Notable incidents , some declared major incidents and some in which firefighters lost their lives , where the LFB has played a significant role include :",
      "- Grenfell Tower fire , 2017 ( 40 pumps ) In June 2017 the LFB sent over 200 firefighters and officers in 40 fire engines , all 14 of its fire rescue units , four aerial ladder platforms and multiple command and operational support units to the Grenfell Tower fire in north Kensington . Crews were mobilised to the large tower block , which was ultimately almost completely alight , on the Lancaster West estate in the early hours of 14 June 2017 and some remained there for several days bringing the blaze under control . One of Surrey Fire and Rescue Services aerial ladder platforms was also requested due to its additional height . There were 72 fatalities making the incident Britains deadliest residential fire since the Blitz during World War II .",
      "- Wembley industrial estate , 2017 ( 20 pumps ) Over 120 firefighters , 20 pumps and four aerial ladder platforms were mobilised to a large fire in industrial units in Wembley in January 2017 . The blaze affected a number of two-storey units and took around 17 hours to bring under control , and days to dampen down and declare the site safe . Crews from Wembley , Northolt , Willesden , Park Royal , Stanmore and Hillingdon fire stations attended the incident .",
      "- Camden market fire , 2014 ( 10 pumps ) Ten fire engines and over 70 firefighters and officers were called to a fire at Stables Market on Chalk Farm Road , Camden , in May 2014 . A number of shops under railway arches were damaged by the blaze . Around 600 people were evacuated from the area . Crews were first mobilised at around 8 p.m . and the fire was under control by 10:50 p.m . Crews from Kentish Town , Euston , West Hampstead , Lambeth , Holloway , Islington and Soho stations attended the incident . Early indications suggested that the cause of the fire was an accidental electrical issue .",
      "- Vauxhall helicopter crash , 2013 Nearly 150 firefighters were involved in operations following a helicopter crash in Vauxhall in misty conditions during the morning rush-hour on 16 January 2013 . Several specialist vehicles , including heavy rescue and urban search and rescue , were mobilised to the scene where the wreckage fell onto a street , damaging five cars , two motorbikes and two adjacent buildings , after the aircrafts rotor blades struck a construction crane attached to St George Wharf Tower . The pilot and one person on the ground were killed in the incident . Fire crews also attended the tower block where the crane was left in a precarious position , and evacuated hundreds of workers and dozens of homes . A fireboat also carried out a precautionary search of the nearby River Thames .",
      "- Dagenham recycling centre fire , 2012 ( 40 pumps ) Over 200 firefighters attended what was described by the commissioner as the largest fire in London for several years .

      "MS Mega Smeralda",
      "MS Mega Smeralda is a cruiseferry owned by Medinvest and operated by Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries . She was built in 1985 by W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 at the Helsinki New Shipyard in Helsinki , Finland for Johnson Line as MS Svea for use in Silja Line traffic . Between 1992 and 1994 she sailed for Silja Line as MS Silja Karneval , and between 1994 and 2008 for Color Line as MS Color Festival .",
      "History .",
      "Silja Line service .",
      "MS Svea and her sister MS Wellamo were modeled after Silja Lines highly successful Helsinki\u2013Stockholm service ferries MS Finlandia and MS Silvia Regina . The main difference to the older pair of ships was outer appearance of the new sisters : where Finlandia and her sister had had a very box-like exterior , the new sisters for the Turku\u2013Stockholm route had more attractive rounded looks .",
      "In 1989 there were plans to rebuild Svea with rails on the cardeck so that she could also carry railroad carriages on board , but these were shelved . Until 1990 her funnel displayed the colours of Johnson Line , but at that time Silja Lines owners Johnson Line and Effoa merged into one company , EffJohn , and Silja Lines seal logo was moved from the ships hulls into their funnels .",
      "In 1992 Svea and her sister underwent a large-scale reconstruction at Lloyd Werft in Bremerhaven , Germany where most of the ships interiors were rebuilt , a new skybar added on deck 9 , a new more blue-dominated colour scheme replaced the traditional Silja stripes and the ship was renamed Silja Karneval in accordance with Siljas new name policy . In fact the funds used to rebuild Svea and Wellamo were originally meant for rebuilding of the GTS Finnjet , but her planned rebuilding would have been too expensive and EffJohn opted to spend what money they had on Svea and Wellamo instead .",
      "Color Line service .",
      "Silja Karnevals service on Silja proved to be short . In early 1994 EffJohn decided to sell her sister Silja Festival to Norway-based Color Line . However , when time came to deliver the ship to Color Line , EffJohn for some reason decided to sell them Silja Karneval instead ( the two ships being structurally identical ) . Problematically for Color Line , they had already printed material advertising their new ship as the Color Festival . As result Silja Karneval became M/S Color Festival , not Color Karneval as would have been logical .",
      "After reconstruction at Cityvarvet , Gothenburg , Color Festival was initially placed on the Oslo\u2013Hirtshals route . In 2002 she damaged one of her rudders in Hirsthals and had to be docked in Hamburg because of it . In April 2006 she started operating on the Oslo\u2013Fredrikshavn route in direct competition with her old Silja Line fleetmate MS Stena Saga . On 21 November 2007 Color Line sold Color Festival to Corsica Ferries for \u20ac49 million ( 400 million Norwegian krone ) , in preparation for the delivery of the new Color Superspeed vessels in mid-2008 .",
      "Corsica Sardinia Ferries service .",
      "The Color Festival was delivered to Corsica Sardinia Ferries in early January 2008 , subsequently renamed Mega Smeralda and re-flagged in Italy with Genoa as her homeport . Reportedly she will be placed on Civitavecchia \u2013 Golfo Aranci or Livorno \u2013 Golfo Aranci service . In 2011 , the ferry operates between Tolone , Ajaccio , Bastia , Nice , etc.. .",
      "2013 Tour de France .",
      "In June 2013 , the Tour de France visited Corsica for the first time . To accommodate the Tour entourage , the organisers chartered the Mega Smeralda to house members of the organisation , media and others who worked on the Tour and to host press conferences , although the riders stayed in hotels in Porto-Vecchio .",

Hasselhoff has also worked as a talent show judge on television shows such as Americas Got Talent ( 2006\u20132009 ) and Britains Got Talent ( 2011 ) .",
      "Early life .",
      "Hasselhoff was born in Baltimore , Maryland , the son of Dolores Theresa ( n\u00e9e Mullinex ; April 23 , 1930 \u2013 February 11 , 2009 ) , a homemaker , and Joseph Vincent Hasselhoff ( May 2 , 1925 \u2013 November 16 , 2014 ) , a business executive . His family is Roman Catholic with German , English , and Irish descent . His great-great-grandmother , Meta , emigrated with her family to Baltimore from V\u00f6lkersen , Germany in 1865 .",

He studied at Oakland University before graduating with a degree in theater at the California Institute of the Arts .",
      "Early career .",
      "Hasselhoff portrayed Dr . Snapper Foster on The Young and the Restless from 1975 to 1982 , leaving the series as the show wrote out many of their original characters . His feature film debut was in 1974 as Boner in Revenge of the Cheerleaders which he did to get accredited into the Screen Actors Guild . At the time , he believed that the film would not be released , but it was : two years later , also appearing under the title Caught with their Pants Down . In 1979 , he played Simon in Starcrash . He launched his singing career with guest appearances on the first season of childrens program Kids Incorporated , performing Do You Love Me . He guest-starred on two episodes of Diffrent Strokes and the soap opera Santa Barbara as himself in 1984 .",
      "Knight Rider .",
      "Hasselhoff was recruited by then NBC President Brandon Tartikoff to star in the science-fiction series Knight Rider from 1982 to 1986 as Michael Knight . He has described Knight Rider as more than a TV show : Its a phenomenon . Its bigger than Baywatch ever was . On the success of Knight Rider \u2013 Its because it was about saving lives , not taking lives , and it was how one man really can make a difference .",
      "He describes the acting he has done as a little more difficult than if you had a regularly well-written script \u2013 like , if I was going to be in , say , Reservoir Dogs , or The Godfather , or Dances with Wolves or Lawrence of Arabia or ER , I had to talk to a car . His role in the show led him to a Peoples Choice Award for Most Popular Actor . Now , over 33 years later , the show is still playing throughout the world .",
      "Baywatch .",
      "Hasselhoff returned to television on Baywatch which premiered in 1989 . Although it was canceled after only one season , he believed the series had potential , so Hasselhoff revived it for the first-run syndication market in 1991 , investing his own money and additionally functioning as executive producer . His contract stipulated royalties to be paid to him from the rerun profits , which gave him the financial liberty to buy back the rights to Baywatch from NBC .",
      "In its second incarnation , Baywatch was much more successful . It ran for a total of 11 years and , from the 1990s until its series finale in 2001 , was watched by almost 1 billion viewers across 140 countries , solidifying his status among the worlds foremost television personalities of the said period .",
      "This success combined with his royalties and his other ventures have placed Hasselhoffs fortune at more than $100 million .",
      "In 1991 , Hasselhoff reprised his role as Michael Knight in the television film Knight Rider 2000 as a sequel to the original series . The movie served as a pilot for a proposed new series , but despite high ratings , the plan was abandoned .",
      "In 1996 , Hasselhoff was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . In 1997 , he performed a duet with Filipino singer Regine Velasquez , which was used as the main theme for his 1998 movie Legacy . He made his Broadway debut in 2000 in the title role of Jekyll & Hyde . In August 2001 , he hosted an event at the Conga Room , in Los Angeles honoring the Latin rock band Renegade for record sales in excess of 30 million units worldwide , taking the stage with the Latin rockers and singing in Spanish .

      "Viaduto do Ch\u00e1 ( Tea Viaduct ) is a viaduct of S\u00e3o Paulo , Brazil . It was the first viaduct built in the city , and was instigated by Jules Martin , a French immigrant to the city . The span crosses the Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa . Originally conceived in 1877 , construction started in 1888 before being stopped one month later by a court case brought by local residents . Construction resumed in 1889 , and the iron bridge was completed in 1892 . The original viaduct was replaced in 1938 with a new concrete span . It often appears in TV interviews , as well as films and telenovelas set in S\u00e3o Paulo .",
      "Background .",
      "The viaduct is located in S\u00e3o Paulo , Brazil . It runs over the Anhangaba\u00fa River in the Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa valley , which separated two cities . On one side was the city centre of S\u00e3o Paulo , which ended at the Rua Direita . On the other side was a neighbourhood called Morro do Ch\u00e1 ( now Republica and Consola\u00e7\u00e3o ) , which lacked good transportation and policing . In order to get between the two , a long tram ride in a U-shape around the valley was required , or to go down a steep descent to the Ponte do Lorena and cross there , returning up a slope on the other side near to Rua Xavier de Toledo . An extension of the citys tram network to Consola\u00e7\u00e3o was proposed in 1879 , but was rejected by local residents as being good for the tram company but bad for local residents .",
      "Original viaduct .",
      "The idea of building a viaduct came from Jules Martin , a French immigrant who was active in solving problems in the city , including installing the citys first gas engine , and drawing the first map of the province . He presented initial plans to connect Rua Direita to Rua Bar\u00e3o de Itapetininga with a viaduct in 1877 . Expanded plans for a boulevard were detailed in 1882 , but by 1885 the plans had reverted to the viaduct , and Martin signed a contract to construct it and to form a company to do so . Planning started on 30 April 1888 .",
      "After one month the work on the viaduct stopped . Some of the residents were against the viaduct , including Francisco Xavier Pais de Barros , the Baron of Tatu\u00ed , and his wife , one of whose houses was slated for demolition to construct the viaduct . People in favour of the viaduct attacked his house with picks to force him to move . In May 1889 their court case was defeated , and the viaduct was constructed .",
      "Construction restarted in 1889 , initially run by the company Companhia Paulista do Ch\u00e1 . Due to delays , the company ran out of funding and almost went bankrupt ; the project was transferred to Companhia de Ferro Carril de S\u00e3o Paulo , which completed the construction .",
      "The -long viaduct had a structure made of iron imported from Germany , with a wooden floor . It was wide , and carried pedestrians , horse-drawn trams , and other animal-drawn vehicles ( but fixed-axle vehicles were banned ) . It was inaugurated on 6 November 1892 . It was S\u00e3o Paulos first viaduct , and was named after a nearby tea plantation called Morro do Ch\u00e1 .",
      "It was originally operated as a gated toll road in order to cover the construction expenses . The toll to cross the bridge was 60 r\u00e9is , or three vint\u00e9ns , per person , which led to the nickname for the viaduct of Viaduto dos Tr\u00eas Vint\u00e9ns ( Three Vint\u00e9ns Viaduct ) . For trams the toll was 200 r\u00e9is . The toll was removed in 1896 when the viaduct was expropriated by the city council .",
      "The bridge was strengthened and enlarged in 1902 when electric trams were introduced to the city , and the valley that it passed over was turned into a park in 1910 . The Municipal Theatre was constructed nearby 1911 on the site of an earlier sawmill . In the 1920s cars started to cross the viaduct .",
      "Replacement .",
      "By the 1930s , the original viaduct was too narrow to cope with the increase in traffic due to the growth of the city . A new double-width bridge made of reinforced concrete was constructed with a long arch supported by two pillars , adjacent to the original viaduct . It was designed by Elis\u00e1rio Bahiana , and was inaugurated on 23 February 1938 ; the original viaduct was demolished starting on 18 April 1938 .",
      "The park below the bridge changed substantially in the 1940s , with the river being taken underground and new roads constructed in the valley passing under the viaduct . The area changed significantly again in the 1990s , with a new road tunnel passing through the valley and a new park constructed on top of the tunnel . In 1992 the deck of the viaduct was refurbished . The viaduct is now adjacent to the Matarazzo Building , S\u00e3o Paulos town hall",
      "The bridge has been one of the icons of the city for many years , and is often used as a backdrop during TV interviews , and in movies and telenovelas set in S\u00e3o Paulo . The viaduct has often been used for suicides , a fact that has been featured in songs . In April 2010 the sidewalk of the viaduct was occupied by around 700 tents ."

      "Sydney Theatre Company ( STC ) is an Australian theatre company based in Sydney , New South Wales . The company performs in The Wharf Theatre at Dawes Point in The Rocks area of Sydney , as well as the Roslyn Packer Theatre ( formerly Sydney Theatre ) and the Sydney Opera House Drama Theatre .",
      "History .",
      "Sydney Theatre Company was formed in December 1978 , following the closure of The Old Tote Theatre Company the month before . The then Premier , Neville Wran , approached Elizabeth Butcher , who had been seconded from the National Institute of Dramatic Art to administer the Old Tote , and asked her to set up a new state theatre company , to perform in the Drama Theatre of the Sydney Opera House . Butcher established its legal identity and managerial structure , and proposed the name , Sydney Theatre Company . With John Clark ( Director of NIDA ) as the Artistic Adviser of the first season , five theatre companies were invited to produce six plays to be presented by STC as the 1979 Interim Season in the Drama Theatre . The first production , by The Paris Company , was A Cheery Soul , by Patrick White , Australias Nobel Laureate for Literature , directed by Jim Sharman , featuring Robyn Nevin as Miss Docker .",
      "In June 1979 , Richard Wherrett , then one of Nimrod Theatres co-Artistic Directors , was appointed Artistic Director of STC to plan and organise activities for the 1980 season . The first STC-produced play was The Sunny South , 1 January 1980 , by George Darrell , with music by Terence Clarke , directed by Richard Wherrett , assisted by John Gaden .",
      "In its early years the company operated out of several rented premises around the city , producing 38 productions in five separate venues . Elizabeth Butcher , STC Administrator , was given the task of finding one location that could house all the activities of the company , and a theatre . After an extensive search , Butcher had the vision to propose the derelict Walsh Bay Wharf 4/5 as STCs new home , immediately envisaging the capacity of the building to fulfill all requirements of space , location and additional venue .",
      "More than three years of budgetary and bureaucratic obstacles were overcome when , on 12 September 1983 , NSW Premier , the Hon . Neville Wran , announced that the State Government had approved the expenditure of $3.5 million to finance the re-cycling project . The 60-year-old ironbark timber wharf warehouse built to load cargo onto ships tied up alongside , was converted into premises suitable for creating , producing , performing and enjoying theatre , without sacrificing its historical integrity or context .",
      "The Wharf was officially handed over to STC in a plaque-unveiling ceremony on 13 December 1984 . In 1985 , The Wharf , by architects Vivian Fraser in association with NSW Govt Architect JW Thomson , won the Sir John Sulman Medal awarded by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects ( NSW Chapter ) for a work of excellence in public and commercial architecture . The first STC production in The Wharf Theatre ( now Wharf 1 ) , 17 January 1985 , was Late Arrivals , by Pamela van Amstel , directed by Wayne Harrison in his directorial debut . ( Wayne Harrison went on to become the second Artistic Director of the company , in 1990. ) The play was part of a season of one-act plays called Shorts at the Wharf .",
      "Since 1984 , and the visionary adaptation and re-use of an industrial site by Sydney Theatre Company , Walsh Bay has been transformed into an arts precinct and residential area , which continues to attract adjunct services .",
      "Other performing arts companies and organisations now enjoy premises at The Wharf , including Sydney Dance Company , Ausdance , Sydney Philharmonia Choirs , Gondwana Choirs , Sydney Childrens Choir , The Song Company , Australian Theatre for Young People , Regional Arts , Accessible Arts , Bangarra Dance Theatre . Nearly a quarter of a centurys use later , The Wharf , by Vivian Fraser , in association with the NSW Government Architect , was presented the RAIA 25 Year Award for Enduring Architecture by the Institute .",
      "Directors working regularly for STC include Gale Edwards , Barrie Kosky , David Berthold , Neil Armfield , Benedict Andrews and Kip Williams . Many Australian actors who would later find wider success both locally and internationally such as Hugo Weaving , Geoffrey Rush , Cate Blanchett , Jacqueline McKenzie , Richard Roxburgh and Toni Collette have established their careers in STC productions .",
      "Greening the Wharf .",
      "The Sydney Theatre Company operates out of a heritage site of the wharf area of Sydney Harbour . Under the leadership of Blanchett and Upton , STC initiated a comprehensive large scale environmental program called Greening the Wharf , investing in solar energy , rainwater harvesting , energy efficiency measures and best practice waste management . The program goes beyond infrastructure projects to include employees , environmentally responsible theatre production , community engagement and education . The program won two Green Globe Awards ."

      "Entropa is a sculpture by Czech artist David \u010cern\u00fd . The project was commissioned by the Czech Republic to mark the occasion of its presidency of the Council of the European Union , and was originally designed as a collaboration for 27 artists and artist groups from all member countries of the European Union . However , as a hoax , \u010cern\u00fd and three of his assistants created a satirical and controversial piece that depicted pointed stereotypes of the EU member nations . Fake artist profiles were also created by \u010cern\u00fd and his accomplices , complete with invented descriptions of their supposed contributions .",
      "The sculpture was unveiled informally on 12 January 2009 , followed by its official media launch date three days later . The sculpture was originally on display in the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels . Between September 2010 and March 2012 , the sculpture was on exhibit at the Techmania Science Center in Plze\u0148 . A copy of the sculpture has also been planned for the Nov\u00e1 Sc\u00e9na cafe in the National Theatre in Prague .",
      "Background .",
      "The Council of the European Union adheres to a rotational presidency system , whereby the governments of member countries exchange leadership every six months . It is customary for the presiding country to place an exhibit in the Justus Lipsius building , with past works avoiding controversy . For example , France , which had held the presidency before the Czech Republic , simply erected a large balloon in the French national colours in honor of the tradition .",
      "Theme .",
      "Entropa is an ironic jab at the issue of European integration and the stereotypes associated with each country within the European Union . It is subtitled Stereotypes are barriers to be demolished , along with the Czech European Union Presidencys motto of Europe without barriers . According to David \u010cern\u00fd , the sculptures primary artist , Entropa lampoons the socially activist art that balances on the verge between would-be controversial attacks on national character and undisturbing decoration of an official space . In an interview with The Times , \u010cern\u00fd stated that the sculpture was influenced by the Monty Python brand of humour . At the launch ceremony , he added Sacha Baron Cohen and Les Guignols de linfos portrayal of Nicolas Sarkozy as other influences .",
      "The work is made of glass-reinforced plastic and the joints of steel . It covers approximately , measuring high and wide . Three-quarters of the weight comes from the frame , making up a combined total of 8 tonnes . It resembles the parts of a model kit , containing pieces in the shapes of the 27 member states of the EU . Each piece has a distinctive theme that portrays stereotypes about the country , some of which are portrayed in a particularly provocative manner . Among the pieces which have attracted the most attention are those of Bulgaria , Denmark , Germany , Poland and Slovakia .",
      "The sculpture was installed between 5 and 11 January 2009 in the presence of David \u010cern\u00fd , three assistants , four climbers , two technicians , two cameramen and a representative of the Czech Permanent Representation to the EU .",

      "- The United Kingdom , known for its Euroscepticism and relative isolation from Europe , is included as a missing piece ( an empty space ) at the top-left of the sculpture .",
      "Reaction .",
      "Entropa has inspired debate in Europe since the day of its first unveiling . Various commentators have noted that this is probably the first such exhibition in the history of art displays on behalf of the rotary Presidency of the EU Council that has been controversial in nature , contrasted by the fact that such pieces usually go by unnoticed . The work drew what has been described by one reporter as a never-before-seen crowd . It has been praised by some viewers for being hilarious and for inspiring discussion about art , but has angered and offended others .",
      "In June 2009 , David \u010cern\u00fd himself said that he expected completely different reactions than those described below . In his opinion , Bulgaria doesnt even make it to the top three of the most provocative countries caricatured by Entropa . The most provocative country is Poland , with the reference to gays . It is followed by the UK ( missing ) and Slovakia that , according to Mr \u010cern\u00fd , is a bubble restricted by Hungary .",
      "Political controversy .",
      "On 13 January 2009 , the day after the exhibit was informally unveiled , Bulgarias ambassador to the EU registered the countrys protest with the European Commission , and sent a formal protest note to the Czech government . Bulgarias depiction in the sculpture , as a series of squat toilets , is one of the most provocative , and after the informal unveiling of Entropa , the Bulgarian government demanded that the sculpture be taken down before its official launching . This action was never taken , but after continuing complaints , the Bulgarian depiction was covered with black fabric on 20 January 2009 . Individuals outside the government , as well , expressed outrage about the portrayal :",
      "Bulgarian news portal News.bg commented that the countrys deputy was obviously interpreting [ the exhibits ] idea as an insult attempt . A number of non-government organizations , including Polish Indeks 73 , were opposed to covering part of the work and initiated online petitions .",
      "Jan Vytopil , the man in charge of cultural events during the Czech EU Presidency , has defended the exhibit , arguing that the presence of a squat toilet Bulgaria in the presence of the other patently absurd depictions made it clear that the piece seeks to demolish stereotypes rather than cause controversy . Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra also frequently stressed that the government committee which authorized the piece wanted to avoid censorship :",
      "On 14 January 2009 , the Slovak National Party called on Foreign Affairs Minister J\u00e1n Kubi\u0161 to demand the removal of the sculpture , calling it an offence to the Slovak nation . On 15 January 2009 , Kubi\u0161 complied and lodged a formal protest , but did not demand the removal of the sculpture .",
      "Given the controversial nature of the portrayals of other countries , Czech diplomats expected protests from other countries as well . However , these had yet to materialize . In fact , the public in Poland appeared to be largely in favour of Polands portrayal , with 64% considering it spot on and only 13% thinking it an insult to Polish people , according to an online poll by news portal TVN24 .",
      "Ole Molesby , the Danish Ambassador to the Czech Republic , stated that he did not expect the Mohammed caricature protests to begin anew , and that Denmark did not intend to complain . \u010cern\u00fd denied that the similarity was intentional .",
      "Authorship controversy .",
      "On 13 January 2009 , the authorship of Entropa came into question . Officially , the artwork was to have been an international collaboration between David \u010cern\u00fd and artists from the other 26 EU countries . However , on that day , Alexandr Vondra announced the work was probably created by a smaller group of people , explaining that \u010cern\u00fd did not inform him about this until the evening before . The original news article in Lidov\u00e9 noviny pointed out that some of the artists names did not seem to exist in their countries citizen records and had no Internet footprint . \u010cern\u00fd himself admitted on 13 January that the artists names had been fabricated .",
      "The official booklet provided summaries of past expositions for most of the alleged authors , some of which matched those of known artists . For example , Austrias Sabrina Unterberger had a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that apparently belonged to Ernst Logar . Many of these artists had their own websites ( designed by Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pospiszyl , Kri\u0161tof Kintera and Libor Svoboda ) , but the contact information listed was false ( other than the e-mail addresses , which were functional ) .",
      "Lidov\u00e9 noviny originally listed Belgium , Germany , Greece , Ireland , and the UK as countries for which fictitious artists identities were given . These specific claims were later retracted and replaced by general charges that some of the names in the booklet are non-existent , their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s erroneous , or that the artists denied knowing David \u010cern\u00fd or having cooperated with him .",
      "On the evening of 13 January 2009 , \u010cern\u00fd officially admitted that the piece was actually created entirely by him and two friends , and that all the officially supplied artists identities had been fabricated . In a prepared statement , \u010cern\u00fd offered an apology to Prime Minister Mirek Topol\u00e1nek , Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra , and the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg and their offices for deceiving them , stating he did not want them to be responsible for his fabulations . The statement went on to point out : We knew the truth would come out . But before that we wanted to find out if Europe is able to laugh at itself .",
      "The names of \u010cern\u00fds collaborators were given as Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pospiszyl and Kri\u0161tof Kintera . The authors maintained that a larger international team of people was involved in the projects execution . They explained that they originally wanted to contact artists from all 27 member countries of the EU , but failed due to limited time and financing . Alexandr Vondra responded with an official statement expressing his disappointment and stressed that \u010cern\u00fd would bear responsibility for deceiving the government .",
      "Due to the sculptures potential for controversy , the point that each countrys piece was designed by an artist from that country was strongly stressed by the Czech government . According to Lidov\u00e9 noviny , Czech Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra remarked : The fact remains that we have provided a platform for free artistic expression and that is how Entropa must be viewed . But , had I known the circumstances were different than we had thought for a year and a half , I would not have authorized it . Vondra attempted to distance the Czech government from \u010cern\u00fds work early on , saying,It is a piece of art\u2014nothing else.. . If Europe is not strong enough to look at this , it would be a tragedy . It is Europe through the eyes of 27 artists . It is not Europe through the eyes of the Czech presidency .",
      "Fraud accusation .",
      "The sculpture reportedly cost 12 million CZK to make , of which 10 million was contributed by New World Resources , a Dutch mining company which owns OKD in the Czech Republic , and 2 million CZK was paid by the Czech government , which has subsequently leased the work for an additional 1.2 million CZK until the end of June . After the fabrication came to light , \u010cern\u00fd was accused of misappropriating state funds . He responded that the money was not used at all , since the artists knew they would deviate from the stated project , and would be returned .",
      "Response by authors .",
      "\u010cern\u00fd originally stated that he meant for the sculpture to be amusing , saying , Irony is about making fun . It is not meant to offend anybody , and later issuing an official statement saying , We wanted to see if Europe is able to laugh at itself . On 15 January , \u010cern\u00fd reflected on the hostile reception of Entropa :",
      "I certainly dont feel like a winner . Thats how Id feel if there were a few shocked Brusselian bureaucrats walking around the piece , shaking their heads , thinking about what those Czechs have done here . We expected this to be treated as a joke , a happening , a nice installation , nothing else . That we are already discussing the removal of some parts doesnt seem like a tremendous success to me . Id be much happier if it remained whole .",
      "The authors defended their choice to use false names in creating the sculpture by stating the deception was part of the art :",
      "Grotesque exaggeration and mystification is a hallmark of Czech culture , and creating false identities is one of the strategies of contemporary art .",
      "\u010cern\u00fd has also said that making this sculpture in this way was more fun . Later , however , the artists apologized for the deception , saying , We apologize to Prime Minister Mirek Topol\u00e1nek , Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra , Minister Karel Schwarzenberg and their offices for not informing them about the true state of things and thus deceiving them . Kri\u0161tof Kintera , one of the true co-authors of the sculpture , said in an interview that the mystification was supposed to last longer , but that it was untenable\u2014both ethically , as the artists didnt want to cause more trouble for Czech diplomacy , and practically , as they couldnt keep answering e-mails using the fabricated artists identities .",
      "Kintera also commented that the sculpture revealed a divide between Western and Eastern Europe : We didnt want to defame anyone ; advanced European democracies are used to many things , but the East still strives to promote itself in a positive light , so its not as well attuned to this .",
      "Fate of the sculpture .",
      "After the true authorship of the sculpture came to light , Alexandr Vondra stated its continued display was under review because \u010cern\u00fd had violated the governments specifications of the project , which , in line with \u010cern\u00fds original description , called for an international collaboration of artists . On 14 January 2009 , the official Entropa presentation page was withdrawn from the Czech presidencys website . Nevertheless , the sculpture was ceremonially launched on 15 January 2009 . Alexandr Vondra again defended the piece , saying , we consider Entropa to be art , nothing more and nothing else .",
      "During the ceremony , David \u010cern\u00fd again apologized to the Czech government and expressed regret that the sculpture was considered offensive . He said the offending pieces would be removed if officials cannot be persuaded about the authors intentions .",
      "Removal .",
      "On 23 April 2009 , \u010cern\u00fds intention to remove the sculpture prematurely on 10 May was published , which he presented as a protest against the way in which Topol\u00e1neks government had been deposed and against the prepared Fischers cabinet , which was eventually installed on 8 May .",
      "The removal of the sculpture began on 11 May . \u010cern\u00fd himself was not present , although he had earlier suggested the contrary . A crew he sent there dismantled the sculpture and on Thursday , 14 May loaded its parts into three trucks , which had to come one by one because of limitations of the Justus Lipsius building . Afterwards , the pieces were transported by road to Prague .",
      "The sculpture was set up again in the Centre of Contemporary Art DOX in Prague-Hole\u0161ovice and inaugurated on 11 June 2009 , in presence of guests , including former Czech president V\u00e1clav Havel .",
      "Entropa was on display in the Techmania Science Center in Plze\u0148 as part of an EU exhibition ."

While serving in the state senate , he was a champion of tax relief and helped modernize the states criminal code . In the private sector , he was president of a title insurance company in Bend , Oregon .",
      "Early life .",
      "McKay was born on March 17 , 1910 in Aitkin , Minnesota . His parents were Clyde Marshall and Olive Elizabeth ( Spencer ) McKay . In 1911 , when he was less than a year old , McKay moved with his parents to Oregon . They traveled to central Oregon by passenger train , disembarking at Shaniko , where the railroad line ended at that time . From there the family , took a stagecoach to Bend , where they settled .",
      "After arriving in Bend , his father became active in business , civic affairs , and local politics . McKays father founded the Bend Company , a sawmill operation located along the Deschutes River . Later , his father became president of the Deschutes County Title and Abstract Company . He actively supported the effort to form a new county from the western part of Crook County . When the new Deschutes County was created in 1916 , McKays father was elected county treasurer , a position he held for 14 years . In addition , he served on the Bend city council and the local school board .",
      "McKay attended school in Bend , graduating from high school there in 1929 . He then attended the University of Oregon .",
      "Construction career .",
      "In 1930 , McKay left Bend to take a job with the Oregon Highway Department . He worked for the highway department for four years before taking a career position as a construction engineer with the United States Bureau of Reclamation . His first assignment with the bureau began in 1934 at Parker Dam on the Colorado River located on the border between California and Arizona .",
      "In 1936 , McKay married Melba T . McKay . Prior to her marriage , she worked at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios in Hollywood , California . After their marriage , Melba joined her husband at the Parker Dam site . Together they had two children .",
      "McKay worked at Parker Dam for a total of four years before transferring to Marshall Ford Dam near Austin , Texas . He remained there until 1942 , when he was reassigned to a power station in Phoenix , Arizona .",
      "In early 1943 , McKay left the Bureau of Reclamation to join the United States Navy . He served as a Chief Warrant Officer in the Seabees , specializing in amphibious landings . He saw combat action in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater during World War II including participation in the Battle of Tarawa . McKay was discharged from the navy in early 1946 .",
      "Businessman and civic leader .",
      "After leaving the navy , McKay moved to Los Angeles , where he sold real estate for four years . He returned to Bend in 1950 , becoming vice president of Deschutes County Title and Abstract Company . At that time , his father was still president of the company .",
      "In 1952 , McKays wife Melba died of cancer at the age of 40 . A year later , McKay married Evelyn Ruth Watson . Prior to her marriage , she owned and operated a cattle ranch along the Lewis River in Washington . After their marriage , she joined McKay in Bend .",
      "In Bend , McKay was involved in a number of civic organizations . He was president of the local Kiwanis . He served on the Bend-La Pine School Board for eleven years , from 1953 through 1963 .

In 1959 , he was chosen as the Bend communitys Boss of the Year . A year later , he was honored as Bends Senior Citizen of the Year .",
      "State Senator .",
      "In 1964 , McKay decided to run for a seat in the Oregon State Senate as a Republican . He was unopposed in the 1964 Republican primary . In the general election that followed , McKay defeated the Democratic candidate , Charles L . Allen of Tumalo . In the state senate , he represented District 19 which at the time included Crook , Deschutes , Jefferson , and Lake counties . The 1965 legislative session lasted just over four months , from January 11 through May 14 . During the session , he was appointed to the powerful ways and means committee . He also participated in a week-long special legislative session , shortly after the close of the 1965 regular session .",
      "Because terms in the Oregon state senate last four years , McKay was seated in the 1967 legislative sessions without running for re-election in 1966 . The 1967 session began on January 11 and lasted through June 14 . During the session , McKay served as chairman of the elections committee and vice chairman of the commerce and utilities committee . He was also a member of the ways and means , air and water quality control , health and welfare , and judiciary committees .",
      "In 1968 , McKay ran for a second term representing District 19 . He was unopposed in the Republican primary and got enough write-in votes in the Democratic primary to win that partys nomination as well . As a result , he was unopposed in the general election . The 1969 legislative session lasted just over three months , starting on January 13 and ending on April 23 . During the session , McKay chaired the rules and resolutions committee and was a member of the ways and means , constitutional revisions and government reorganization , and judiciary committees . His main focus during the session was tax relief .",
      "During the second half of his second senate term , McKay attended the regular 1971 legislative session . That session began on January 11 and lasted through June 10 . McKay served as chairman of the financial affairs committee and vice chairman of the rules and resolutions committee . He was also a member of the judiciary committee . During the session , he helped enact legislation that revised the states criminal code .",
      "Prior to the 1972 election , state senate districts were reorganized . In the redistricting , Deschutes County ( McKays home county ) was joined with Klamath County to form District 27 . In 1972 , McKay ran for a third senate term . This time , seeking to represent District 27 . He won the Republican nomination , but lost the general election to his Democratic opponent , Fred W . Heard of Klamath Falls . In the general election , McKay easily won Deschutes County with 8,509 votes against 6,131 votes for Heard . However , it was the opposite story in Klamath County , where Heard won by an even greater margin . The final vote was 12,578 for McKay and 15,205 for Heard . McKay left the state senate in January 1973 when his second term expired .",
      "Later life and legacy .",
      "After leaving the state Senate , McKay returned to his title insurance business in Bend . When he eventually retired from business , McKay and his third wife , Della Marjorie ( Phillips ) McKay , traveled around the country in a motor home . This included regular trips up and down the west coast to watch University of Oregon Ducks football games . Over the years , they traveled enough to wear out two motor home engines .",
      "McKay died of a heart attack at his home in Bend on October 26 , 1990 . He was 80 years old at the time of his death . McKay is buried in Pilot Butte Cemetery in Bend .",
      "McKays boyhood home was built in 1916 . It is a craftsman style bungalow . Its original site overlooked the Deschutes River . In 1973 , the house was moved to a new location , upstream along the river . It was then restored with the help of the Deschutes County Historical Society . Today , it is a popular restaurant called McKays Cottage .",

      "Love ( Indianapolis )",
      "LOVE is an artwork by American artist Robert Indiana , located at the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields in Indianapolis , Indiana , United States . It was created in 1970 as the first sculptural form of the artists 1965 LOVE painting and has been on continuous exhibition at the Indianapolis Museum of Art since it was acquired in 1975 .",
      "Description .",
      "This pop art sculpture consists of three separate elements fabricated from 3/8 inch-thick sheets of Cor-ten steel . They are bolted together to render the two-dimensional text design in three-dimensional form . The hollow but enclosed block letters are 72 inches deep . The largest piece consists of the L stacked on top of the V and fashioned as one unit without a seam between the letters . The O and E are separate elements that attach to the LV . Two posts are installed on the top of the E for the alignment and stability of the O , which has corresponding openings on its lowest surface .",
      "The right upper serif of the E comes into contact with and forms a smooth continuation to the proper left upper serif of the V . The bottommost curve of the O contacts the E in line with the Es inner vertical surface , and it contacts the L at the upper edge of the Ls lower left serif .",
      "Historical information .",
      "Although the word love contained much significance to 1960s culture , Indiana attributes his connection with the word to an earlier , more personal source . Attending Christian Science church services as a child in Indianapolis , he was impressed by a small plaque over the readers platform bearing the inscription God Is Love . By 1973 , Indiana was no longer a practicing member of the church , but he insisted that the message of LOVE be taken as a spiritual one .",
      "The sculpture is based on the artists original 1965 Christmas card design for MoMA , in which the majuscule letters of the word \u201clove\u201d are arranged in a 2\u00d72 square , LO atop VE , and the O tilted to align with the diagonal of the square . MoMAs commission for the card came one year after Indiana had designed similar Christmas cards for close friends .",
      "After pirated versions of the design began to appear in excess during the late 1960s , Indiana attempted to copyright his work , but this was rejected on the grounds that a single word cannot be protected . Some art critics believed his switch to the large-scale , three-dimensional version of the artwork was an effort by Indiana to reclaim his design in monumental fashion . Generally , however , the innovation of the letters standing as an independent form is seen as an aesthetic progression from his earlier sculptures which utilized typography painted upon flat surfaces .",
      "Other versions .",
      "The IMA\u2019s LOVE is the original sculptural rendition of the design . Many other versions have been made and are displayed worldwide , including editions in Hebrew , Chinese , Italian , and Spanish .",
      "Location history .",
      "LOVE was executed in North Haven , Connecticut , in 1970 by Lippincott , Inc. , a fabricator of large-scale sculpture . After its move to Indianapolis , the sculpture was originally installed on the main plaza at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1970 for the opening of the museums current building . It then spent nearly a year displayed on the city hall plaza in Boston before being loaned to New York City , where it was exhibited in Central Park for the 1971 holiday season .",
      "Upon the artworks return to Indianapolis in 1972 , it was showcased for several months in front of the Indiana National Bank building and later appeared for a short time on the mall behind Eli Lilly and Companys administration building . The purpose of the latter instance was to use the sculpture as a backdrop for a TV commercial promoting the Lilly company ; the ad intended to draw an analogy between the creativity of art and the creativity involved in research .",
      "LOVE has undergone a few location adjustments as the IMA building and grounds have developed over the years . In 2005 , after a major museum expansion , the sculpture was restored and temporarily placed in the museums Pulliam Court before it was moved outdoors to the main sculpture courtyard , where it is surrounded by decorative landscaping and faced Numbers 1-0 , another Indiana sculpture .",
      "Acquisition .",
      "The sculpture was officially accessioned into the IMAs collection in 1975 through a Gift of the Friends of the Indianapolis Museum of Art in memory of Henry F . DeBoest .",
      "Artist .",
      "Robert Indiana ( b . Robert Clark , September 13 , 1928-May 19 , 2018 ) was an American artist associated with the Pop Art movement .",
      "Condition .",
      "As an outdoor sculpture made of a weathering iron alloy , the surface of LOVE should naturally carry an even layer of iron ( III ) oxide , which provides distinctive coloration and also protects the metal underneath from further corrosion . The price of being a cultural icon , however , has continuously disrupted the formation of this layer ; viewers have enjoyed climbing the artwork since its first public appearances , apparent through photography and damage to the appearance of LOVE . Indiana acknowledged the inevitable appeal of his sculpture as a site of exploration for children , couples , and passerby . In a 1973 interview with Indianapolis magazine , he wished only that people would take their shoes off first .",
      "Various conservation efforts to reduce the amount of direct patron contact and its effects , as well as to deal with moisture within the hollow letters have taken place throughout the sculptures lifespan . The Smithsonian American Art Museums Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture surveyed LOVE in July 1993 , and the sculpture was deemed to be well-maintained .",
      "In 2006 the sculpture was blasted with an inert medium ( aluminum oxide ) to strip away uneven surface corrosion , and then it was re-installed outside on an indefinite basis to produce a new patina through natural weathering . The intention is to recreate the original crispy , purplish , and iridescent surface . The restorative efforts of the IMA on behalf of LOVE were made possible through the generosity of Patricia J . and James E . LaCrosse ."

      "Palace of the Republic , Berlin",
      "The Palace of the Republic ( ) was a building in Berlin that hosted the Volkskammer , the parliament of the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany or GDR ) , from 1976 to 1990 .",
      "The Palace of the Republic or Peoples Palace was located on Museum Island in the Mitte area of East Berlin , on the site of the former Berlin Palace between the Lustgarten and Schlossplatz , near the West Berlin border . The Palast was completed in 1976 to house the Volkskammer , also serving various cultural purposes including two large auditoria , art galleries , a theatre , a cinema , 13 restaurants , 5 beer halls , a bowling alley , 4 pool rooms , a billiards room , a rooftop skating rink , a private gym with spa , a casino , a medical station , a post office , a police station with an underground cellblock , a indoor basketball court , an indoor swimming pool , private barbershops and salons , public and private restrooms and a discoth\u00e8que . In the early 1980s , a video game arcade for the children of Volkshammer members and staff replaced one of the restaurants .",
      "In 1990 , the Palast became vacant following German reunification and was closed for health reasons , due to there being more than 5,000 tonnes of asbestos in the building ( despite asbestos being outlawed in construction in East Germany in 1968 ) . In 2003 , the Bundestag voted for the demolition of the Palast and replacement with a reconstruction of the Berlin Palace which had been demolished in the 1950s . The Palast was demolished between 2006 and 2008 , and the reconstruction of the Berlin Palace began in 2013 and was completed in 2020 .",
      "History .",
      "Construction .",
      "Construction of the Palace of the Republic ( ) began in 1973 , with a cost stated at 485 million East German marks according to an internal list of Wolfgang Junker , the Minister of Construction , although other estimates suggest about 800 million to 1 billion marks . It was built on the site of the Berlin Palace ( Stadtschloss ) , the former royal palace of Prussia , located on Museum Island in East Berlin , less than along Unter den Linden from the West Berlin border at the Brandenburg Gate . The Berlin Palace had been controversially demolished in 1950 after suffering extensive damage during the Battle of Berlin in World War II , as the government had no budget in the post-war years for the restoration and it was viewed as a symbol of Prussian imperialism . The site was used as a parade ground and parking lot during the 1950s and 1960s until its designation as the location for a new building to seat the Volkskammer , the unicameral legislature of the GDR , which was provisionally seated at the Langenbeck-Virchow-Haus at 58/59 Luisenstra\u00dfe .",
      "The Palast was designed in a modernist style by Heinz Graffunder and the Building Academy of the German Democratic Republic ( Bauakademie der DDR ) , with distinctive bronze-mirrored windows as a defining architectural feature . It consisted of two massive outer blocks and a middle piece inserted between them , which together gave the building the shape of a cuboid with a length of , a width of , and a height of which was based on that of the neighbouring buildings . The new building took up the eastern half of the plot while the western half was intended as a military parade ground , though tremors from the heavy vehicles were found to endanger the glass facade on the unstable grounds of Museum Island . Instead , the western half was used mainly as a parking lot and military parades were moved to Karl-Marx-Allee .",
      "In addition to housing the Volkskammer , the Palast was intended as a multiple-use structure influenced by the concepts of Palaces of Culture and Peoples Houses popular with socialist movements . Such cultural buildings were common not only in the Eastern Bloc , but also find examples in Belgium , France ( Center Georges Pompidou ) , the Netherlands and Sweden ( House of Culture in Stockholm ) Buildings led . In the young Soviet Union in particular , cultural centers became symbols of the new state power . The Palast contained a large bowling alley at the lower level , from which the canal-side terrace along the River Spree could be accessed , and featured Brunswick lane equipment and a bar . The part of the Palace open to the public featured numerous cameras for the surveillance of staff and visitors by Stasi officials . It was the first building in the GDR to feature a self-supporting steel skeleton and contained 5,000 tons of asbestos used for fire protection .",
      "Seat of the Volkskammer .",
      "The Palast was officially opened on 23 April 1976 and its facilities were opened to the public two days later .",
      "Numerous important cultural , political , academic , and social events of the German Democratic Republic occurred at the Palast after its opening . Events were held in the Palast\u2019s Great Hall , a large hexagonal room some 67 meters wide and 18 meters high . The Great Hall was notable for its versatility ; lifting devices under the floor allowed for a stage of variable height and size . The surface area of the stage could thus range anywhere from 170 to 1000 m\u00b2 , and the hall could seat between 1000 and 4500 attendants . Many editions of the GDR television entertainment program Ein Kessel Buntes were recorded in the Great Hall . Concerts of famous orchestras such as the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig under Kurt Masur , modern interpretations of classical music such as the Messiah of George Frideric Handel , and performances by Bulat Okudzhava ( 29 November 1976 ) , Harry Belafonte ( 25 October 1983 ) , Karel Gott ( 1983 ) , 1986 with Dara Rolins and Heidi Jank\u016f , 1987 ) or of the rock-band Purple Schulz ( 21 January 1989 ) . German electronic music group Tangerine Dream performed a concert recorded live at the Palast on 31 January 1980 which also was Johannes Schmoellings first live performance with the band . Erich Honecker , Willi Stoph and other members of the Central Committee were in attendance . The concert was unique in that Tangerine Dream was the first Western group who was allowed by the GDR government to play in East Berlin at the time and was dubbed the performance behind the Iron Curtain . An album of this recorded concert was released titled Quichotte on East German record label Amiga , and later released to the rest of the world on Virgin Records six years later and renamed Pergamon . In October 1983 , the West German rock star Udo Lindenberg was permitted to perform in concert at the Palast . At the concert , Lindenberg did not sing one of his best-known songs , Sonderzug nach Pankow ( Special Train to Pankow ) , which satirized East German leader Erich Honecker , as he was asked not to play it . Additionally , in April 1987 , American Latin rock band Santana did two concerts here .",
      "The Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) , the ruling party of the GDR , held party congresses at the Palast and a state gala was held on the eve of the 40th ( and final ) anniversary of the GDR in October 1989 , at which Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was present . During the night of 22\u201323 August 1990 , the Volkskammer decided in the Palast on the accession of the GDR to the Federal Republic of Germany with effect from 3 October 1990 , known as German reunification .",
      "The Palast had many nicknames in the Springer press in West Berlin and among East German citizens , such as Palazzo Prozzo ( a wordplay , as protzen means to show off ) or Erichs Lampenladen ( Erich Honeckers lamp shop ) .",
      "Closure and demolition .",
      "The Palast was closed to the public on 19 September 1990 by decree of the Volkskammer when it was found to be contaminated by the asbestos , only two weeks before the accession date . On 2 October 1990 , the Volkskammer was dissolved and the Palast became vacant . By 2003 , the asbestos was considered to have been removed along with internal and external fittings allowing either safe reconstruction or safe deconstruction , and the shell of the building was opened for visitors in mid-2003 . In November 2003 , the Bundestag decided to demolish the Palast and reconstruct the Berlin Palace , leaving the area as parkland until funding could be found . The majority of former East Germans opposed the demolition and various protests were held by people who felt the building was an integral part of Berlins culture and the historic process of the German reunification .",
      "Beginning in early 2004 , the Palast was used for events , such as housing an exhibition of the Terracotta Army and a special concert by the famous Berlin-based band Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten . Demolition started on 6 February 2006 , and was scheduled to last about fifteen months at a cost of \u20ac12 million , however the demolition lasted longer than scheduled because of hazards to neighbouring buildings . Dismantling of the structure was seriously delayed after more asbestos was discovered in various locations , and the estimated completion date was pushed back to the end of 2008 . About 35,000 tonnes of steel which once held this building together were shipped to the United Arab Emirates to be used for the construction of the Burj Khalifa . Although the original structure in Berlin has been demolished , its sister building , the Kulturpalast in Dresden , is still intact and currently used as a symphony orchestra hall .",
      "Berlin Palace reconstruction .",
      "In January 2006 , about two years after the Bundestag decided for the rebuilding of the Berlin Palace , a second definitive vote re-approved the plans . It was decided three of its sides would be exact replicas of the original , but the fourth side and interior would be modern . Called the Humboldtforum , the rebuilt palace will house the Humboldt collection and gallery of non-European art . In November 2008 , the Italian architect Francesco Stella was chosen for the project .",
      "Gallery .",
      "16 monumental pictures by GDR artists presented Dreams of Communists : Walter Womacka , Willi Sitte , Wolfgang Mattheuer , Werner T\u00fcbke , Bernhard Heisig . The pictures were shown in Potsdam 20 years later ."

      "New South Wales C38 class locomotive",
      "The C38 class ( occasionally known as the 38 class and nicknamed Pacifics by some railwaymen ) was a class of steam locomotive built for the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia .",
      "Constructed between January 1943 and November 1949 , the 30 locomotives in the class were designed to haul express passenger services throughout New South Wales . They were the only New South Wales locomotives to use the popular Pacific 4-6-2 wheel arrangement and were the last steam locomotives in the state to be built for passenger train operation , all subsequent deliveries being specifically for freight haulage .",
      "Design .",
      "The 38 class were first conceived in the 1930s when the NSWGR established there was a need for a locomotive to eliminate the complications of double heading on a number of fast intrastate passenger trains .",
      "The design was influenced by the fashion for streamlining at the time , including elements of the class J locomotives of the Norfolk and Western Railway and of some of the streamlined versions of the PRR K4 locomotives in the United States . The design team was headed by Harold Young , the Principal Design Engineer ( later Chief Mechanical Engineer ) of the NSWGR . The conditions of trackwork with frequent sharp curvature to be traversed at high speed would require six-coupled driving wheels in a Pacific 4-6-2 configuration . Maintenance requirements suggested a two-cylinder simple steam locomotive .",
      "The design was carried out by the NSWGR Locomotive Section of the Design Office and incorporated the latest developments in locomotive design from Australia and overseas . The incorporation of as many Australian manufactured components as possible was a requirement at the design stage .",
      "Similarly to the earlier D57 class ( which had some input from Young ) , the massively proportioned locomotive incorporated a cast steel chassis . The design also sported cast Boxpok coupled wheels for better rotational balance , and a Delta trailing truck .",
      "History .",
      "In May 1939 , an order for five 38 class locomotives was placed with Clyde Engineering . They suffered many delays during construction , mostly due to resource shortages caused by World War II and the Great Depression . The first five locomotives , built by Clyde Engineering , had a semi-streamlined boiler casing . The design , however , as with many others , did possess a teething trouble : no fireman could maintain steam in the 245 psi boiler \u2013 the highest boiler pressure of any engine in Australia . In early trials on the Southern line , 3801 , the class leader , was allocated two firemen . The fault was located when it was found that the shape of the blast pipe prevented steam from the cylinders from passing optimally into the petticoat pipe below the chimney , through which it was ejected to the atmosphere . In turn , this reduced the suction of hot gases through the boiler tubes , making it more demanding to fire . Soon the blast pipe was adjusted , and the C38 class became noted for the clean bark of its exhaust .",
      "As the last of the five initial locomotives were leaving the shop in 1945 , a decision was made to purchase more . This order of 25 locomotives were built at the New South Wales Government Railways Eveleigh Railway Workshops ( 13 , even-numbered ) and Cardiff Locomotive Workshops ( 12 , odd-numbered ) ; all were non-streamlined for quicker maintenance .",
      "The locomotives built by Clyde Engineering were delivered in wartime grey . After the war , all were repainted green , as the 25 unstreamlined locomotives had been from new . In the 1950s , all except 3813 were painted black . 3801 and 3830 had their green livery restored due to pressure from heritage groups in the 1960s .",
      "Among the services they initially hauled were the Central West Express , Newcastle Flyer , Melbourne Limited Express , Riverina Express and South Coast Daylight Express as well as the overnight mail trains . Because of their axle load , they were confined to operating between Sydney and the following extremities of operation : Port Kembla ( Coniston ) , Albury , Dubbo and Maitland , although they worked the North Coast passenger trains to Brisbane until track problems surfaced .",
      "Following the arrival of the 42 , 43 and 44 class diesel locomotives in the 1950s , these began to take over some express services , but the 38 class continued to haul many passenger and freight trains . Even after the electrification of the Main Western line to Lithgow in 1957 and the Main North line to Gosford in January 1960 , using 46 class electric locomotives , the 38s still operated the Central West Express between Lithgow and Orange into the 1960s and the Newcastle Flyer between Gosford and Newcastle until December 1970 .",
      "The 38 class briefly returned to the former Melbourne Limited Express route in April 1962 , when 3830 and 3813 hauled the inaugural standard gauge Spirit of Progress from Albury to Sydney . The first 38 class locomotive was withdrawn in 1961 with the last withdrawn in December 1970 .",
      "In August 1970 , 3801 hauled the Western Endeavour to Perth following the conversion to standard gauge of the Sydney\u2013Perth rail corridor with 3813 assisting as far as Port Pirie . In April 1988 , 3801 again operated to Perth during the Australian Bicentenary .",
      "Locomotive 3801 featured in an evocative 1974 short film , A Steam Train Passes , which won many awards and is generally regarded as Australias finest railway film .",
      "Preservation .",
      "4 of the 38 class locomotives survive-3801 , 3813 , 3820 and 3830 . 3813 is in pieces at Dorrigo after an overhaul in 1972 by the former NSW Rail Transport Museum was forced to be stopped by the then commissioner of the Public Transport Commission , Philip Shirley who ordered that the locomotives parts be transferred to the scrapyard . The NSWRTM managed a reprive and the parts were sent to be stored in many locations . Components such as the wheels , cab and smokebox were stored in S trucks at Thirlmere , the frame and tender at Clyde and the boiler at Castle Hill until they were donated to the Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum . Over time all were donated to the Dorrigo museum and put in storage there"

Niigata Prefecture contains the Niigata Major Metropolitan Area centered on Niigata with a population of 1,395,612 , the largest metropolitan area on the Sea of Japan coast and the twelfth-largest in Japan . Niigata Prefecture is part of the historic Hokuriku region and features Sado Island , the sixth largest island of Japan in area following the four main islands and Okinawa Island .",
      "History .",
      "Until after the Meiji Restoration , the area that is now Niigata Prefecture was divided into Echigo Province ( on the mainland ) and Sado Province . During the Sengoku period , the Nagao clan , who were at times vassals to the Uesugi , ruled a fief in the western part of modern Niigata from Kasugayama Castle . The most notable member of the Nagao clan was Nagao Kagetora , later and better known as Uesugi Kenshin . He unified the leaders of Echigo Province and became its sole ruler . By taking the surname Uesugi , he also became the head of the Uesugi clan and effectively brought their realm under his control .",
      "The city of Niigata is now the third largest Japanese city facing the Sea of Japan , after Fukuoka and Kitakyushu . It was the first Japanese port on the Sea of Japan to be opened to foreign trade following the opening of Japan by Matthew Perry . It has since played an important role in trade with Russia and Korea . A freighter from North Korea visits Niigata once a month , in one of the few forms of direct contact between Japan and that country .",
      "The Etsuzankai organization , led by the politician Kakuei Tanaka , was highly influential in bringing infrastructure improvements to Niigata Prefecture in the 1960s and 1970s . These included the J\u014detsu Shinkansen high-speed rail line and the Kanetsu Expressway to Tokyo .",
      "On October 23 , 2004 , the Ch\u016betsu earthquake struck Niigata Prefecture and was measured at Shindo 6+ at Ojiya .",

      "Breitscheidplatz",
      "Breitscheidplatz ( ) is a major public square in the inner city of Berlin , Germany . Together with the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm boulevard , it marks the centre of former West Berlin and the present-day City West . It is named after Rudolf Breitscheid .",
      "Location .",
      "Breitscheidplatz lies within the Charlottenburg district near the southwestern tip of the Tiergarten park and the Zoological Garden at the corner of Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and its eastern continuation , Tauentzienstra\u00dfe , leading to Sch\u00f6neberg and the Kaufhaus des Westens on Wittenbergplatz . The Europa-Center mall and highrise closes off the Breitscheidplatz to the east . At its centre is the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church with its damaged spire .",
      "History .",
      "Breitscheidplatz is at the end of the former Kurf\u00fcrstendamm bridle path of 1542 which led Elector ( Kurf\u00fcrst ) Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg to his hunting grounds in the Grunewald forest . In 1889 the square was given the name Gutenbergplatz after Johannes Gutenberg , the designer of the printing press ; in 1892 it was renamed Auguste-Viktoria-Platz in honour of the German Empress Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein .",
      "Shortly after the square was laid out , Auguste-Viktorias spouse Emperor Wilhelm II determined it as the site for the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in honour of his grandfather , Emperor Wilhelm I . The church , designed by royal architect Franz Schwechten , was a prime example of Romanesque Revival architecture . Being a native Rhinelander , Schwechtens design of the church was inspired by the Bonn Minster which Wilhelm II knew quite well as he studied in Bonn . It was consecrated in 1895 . Around the square until World War I , further development took place in a similar Neo-Romanesque style , including on the west side the Ausstellungshallen am Zoologischen Garten , an exhibition and event space completed in 1896 , and opposite it the 1899 building on the site of todays Europa-Center which after 1916 housed the Romanisches Caf\u00e9 . The square was sometimes called the Romanisches Forum ( Romanesque Forum ) or Romanisches Viertel ( Romanesque Quarter ) as a result .",
      "20th century .",
      "After World War I , the square became a meeting place for bohemians and intellectuals in Berlin , particularly at the Romanisches Caf\u00e9 , where writers , artists and musicians congregated and exchanged ideas . In addition , cinema and variety theatre development had begun in the area with conversion of part of the exhibition space on the west side . In 1925 the Ufa-Palast am Zoo opened in one of these spaces , then Germanys largest cinema , followed in 1926 by the Gloria-Palast on the western side , where The Blue Angel premi\u00e8red on 1 April 1930 . By 1928 , when Joseph Goebbels made a speech attacking the commercial establishments surrounding the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church , the square contained a cluster of Berlins premier cinemas\u2014Ufa-Palast am Zoo , Gloria-Palast , Capitol , Marmorhaus and Tauntzien-Palast\u2014in addition to caf\u00e9s , theatres , and other business establishments , and some businessmen had sought to establish it as Berlins Broadway .",
      "In 1943 , the square was heavily bombed and most of the area was destroyed . After World War II the square experienced massive reconstruction when it became the quasi-symbolic centre of West Berlin in compensation for the loss of the historic centre around Alexanderplatz and Unter den Linden in Mitte , then part of East Berlin . In 1947 the square was given the new name Breitscheidplatz after Rudolf Breitscheid , a German Social Democrat who was killed at the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1944 .",
      "Post-war .",
      "The Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church ( informally known as der Hohle Zahn , the Hollow Tooth , by Berliners ) was in shambles after the war . In the 1950s and 1960s the trend in Berlin was to tear down buildings damaged in the war and to build anew . The renowned West German architect Egon Eiermann originally planned to completely demolish the ruins , causing numerous public protests . He then designed a modern parish church and separate belfry , beside which the ruined spire of the old church would be preserved as a memorial . The new Ged\u00e4chtniskirche was consecrated in 1961 and soon became the architectural pride of West Berlin and a memorial against war and destruction .",
      "The development of the square included the erection of the Zoo Palast cinema replacing the Ufa-Palast in 1956 , the Bikini-Haus on the northern side finished in 1957 ( named after its bare midriff on the second floor ) and the Schimmelpfeng-Haus built in 1960 ( now demolished ) on the site of the old Gloria-Palast .",
      "In 1965 , the Europa-Center shopping mall was opened by Mayor Willy Brandt on the site of the former Romanisches Caf\u00e9 . It included a large cinema complex and an highrise . The Center with its characteristic Mercedes-Benz star on top became a major business centre and unofficially gave the Breitscheidplatz the reputation of being the commercial hotspot in West Berlin . Today the building still hosts numerous department stores , pavement coffee shops and restaurants and is a popular tourist attraction . It has landmark status .",
      "Redevelopment .",
      "The Breitscheidplatz , still one of Berlins most visited places , is known by many as one of the quintessential squares of Berlin . It presents an awkward yet typical Berlin combination of the old and the new , the cultural and commercial .",
      "Since the turn of the millennium , city plans developed for the Breitscheidplatz include bettering the quality for pedestrians and more public competitions for the future planning of Breitscheidplatz . In 2006 , the automobile tunnel on Budapester Stra\u00dfe in front of the Bikini-Haus was closed and the pedestrian zone extended . From 2010 to 2014 the Bikinihaus was refurbished as a shopping mall and a hotel , including the redevelopment of the adjacent Zoo Palast as a multi-screen cinema complex . The destruction of the Schimmelpfeng-Haus began in 2009 to build the Zoofenster highrise , with offices , restaurants and a Waldorf Astoria hotel , and the neighbouring Upper West tower block , to create an attractive urban area with livable space . Other plans include renovating the bus station on Hardenbergplatz in front of the Bahnhof Zoo and other urban spaces in the vicinity .",
      "2016 Christmas market attack .",
      "On 19 December 2016 , at about 20:00 local time , a truck-ramming attack was made on the Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz , killing twelve people and injuring 48 others .",
      "In preparation for the Christmas market 2018 , the square and its surrounding were fortified against further terrorist attacks .",
      "Public transport .",
      "Breitscheidplatz can be reached by S-Bahn via the Zoologischer Garten station ( S 5 , S 7 , S 75 , S 9 ) as well as by U-Bahn via Zoologischer Garten ( U 2 , U 9 ) and Kurf\u00fcrstendamm stations ( U 1 , U 9 ) . Busses stop at Breitscheidplatz ( lines 100 and 200 ) and Europa-Center ( M29 , M19 ) .",
      "The Bahnhof Zoo was constructed in 1882 and functioned as the main railway station of West Berlin . Its importance as a major hub diminished when in preparation for the 2006 FIFA World Cup the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof was completed at the site of the former Lehrter Bahnhof ; this is now the main train station in Berlin , and the German Intercity-Express and InterCity long distance trains no longer stop by default at Zoologischer Garten ."

      "Freedom Caucus",
      "The Freedom Caucus , also known as the House Freedom Caucus , is a congressional caucus consisting of conservative Republican members of the United States House of Representatives . It was formed in 2015 by what Representative Jim Jordan called a smaller , more cohesive , more agile and more active group of conservative representatives ; it is currently chaired by Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona .",
      "Many members are also part of the much larger Republican Study Committee . The caucus was ideologically aligned with the Tea Party movement , until the latters dissolution . The Freedom Caucus is considered the furthest-right bloc within the House Republican Conference . The caucus supports House candidates through its PAC , the House Freedom Fund .",
      "Historical membership .",
      "As the HFC does not publicize a full membership list , the known number of members at the start of each electoral cycle is listed below .",
      "History .",
      "The caucus originated during the mid\u2013January 2015 Republican congressional retreat in Hershey , Pennsylvania . According to founding member Mick Mulvaney , that was the first time we got together and decided we were a group , and not just a bunch of pissed-off guys . Nine conservative active Republican members of the House began planning a new congressional caucus separate from the Republican Study Committee and apart from the House Republican Conference . The founding members who constituted the first board of directors for the new caucus were Republican representatives Scott Garrett of New Jersey , Jim Jordan of Ohio , John Fleming of Louisiana , Matt Salmon of Arizona , Justin Amash of Michigan , Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho , Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina , Ron DeSantis of Florida and Mark Meadows of North Carolina .",
      "Mick Mulvaney told Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker We had twenty names , and all of them were terrible , Mulvaney said . None of us liked the Freedom Caucus , either , but it was so generic and so universally awful that we had no reason to be against it . In the same interview , Lizza reported that one of the working titles for the group was the Reasonable Nutjob Caucus .",
      "During the crisis over the funding of the Department of Homeland Security in early 2015 , the caucus offered four plans for resolution , but all were rejected by the Republican leadership . One of the caucus leaders , Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho , said the caucus would offer an alternative that the most conservative Republican members could support .",
      "Following the election of Donald Trump , Mick Mulvaney said Trump wants to turn Washington upside down \u2014 that was his first message and his winning message . We want the exact same thing . To the extent that hes got to convince Republicans to change Washington , were there to help him .. . and I think that makes us Donald Trumps best allies in the House .",
      "Opposition to Speaker of the House John Boehner .",
      "The newly formed group declared that a criterion for new members in the group would be opposition to John Boehner as Speaker of the House and willingness to vote against or thwart Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner on legislation that the group opposed .",
      "The House Freedom Caucus was involved in the resignation of Boehner on September 25 , 2015 , and the ensuing leadership battle for the new speaker . Members of the caucus who had voted against Boehner for speaker felt unfairly punished , accusing him of cutting them off from positions in the Republican Study Committee and depriving them of key committee assignments . Boehner found it increasingly difficult to manage House Republicans with the fierce opposition of the Freedom Caucus , and he sparred with House Republican members in 2013 over their willingness to shut down the government in pursuit of goals such as repealing the Affordable Care Act . These members later created and became members of the Freedom Caucus when it was created in 2015 .",
      "After Boehner resigned as speaker , Kevin McCarthy , the House majority leader , was initially the lead contender to succeed him , but the Freedom Caucus withheld its support . However , McCarthy withdrew from the race on October 8 , 2015 , after appearing to suggest that the Benghazi investigation\u2018s purpose had been to lower the approval ratings of Hillary Clinton . On the same day as McCarthy\u2019s withdrawal , Reid Ribble resigned from the Freedom Caucus saying he had joined to promote certain policies and could not support the role that it was playing in the leadership race .",
      "On October 20 , 2015 , Paul Ryan announced that his bid for the speaker of the United States House of Representatives was contingent on an official endorsement by the Freedom Caucus . While the group could not reach the 80% approval that was needed to give an official endorsement , on October 21 , 2015 , it announced that it had reached a supermajority support for Ryan . On October 29 , 2015 , Ryan succeeded John Boehner as the speaker of the House .",
      "Backlash in 2016 .",
      "The group faced backlash from the Republican Party establishment during the 2016 election cycle . One of its members , Congressman Tim Huelskamp , a Tea Party Republican representing Kansas\u2019 First District , was defeated during a primary election on August 2 , 2016 , by Roger Marshall .",
      "Rejection of American Health Care Act in 2017 .",
      "On March 24 , 2017 , the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) , the House Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act , was withdrawn by Republican House speaker Paul Ryan because it lacked the votes to pass , due in large part to opposition from Freedom Caucus Republicans who believed that the replacement provisions had the effect of failing to repeal some elements of the original Affordable Care Act .",
      "Two days later , President Donald Trump publicly criticized the Freedom Caucus and other right-wing groups , such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action , that opposed the bill . Trump tweeted : Democrats are smiling in D.C . that the Freedom Caucus , with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage , have saved Planned Parenthood & Obamacare ! On the same day , Congressman Ted Poe of Texas resigned from the Freedom Caucus . On March 30 , 2017 , Trump declared war on the Freedom Caucus , sending a tweet urging Republicans to fight them in the 2018 midterm elections if they don\u2019t get on the team ( i.e. , support Trumps proposals ) . Vocal Freedom Caucus member Justin Amash responded by accusing Trump of succumb [ ing ] to the D.C . Establishment .",
      "Trump later developed a closer relationship with the caucus chair , Mark Meadows . In April 2018 , Trump described three caucus members\u2014Meadows , Jim Jordan , and Ron DeSantis\u2014as absolute warriors for their defense of him during the course of the Special Counsel investigation .",
      "Criticism from Boehner .",
      "On October 30 , 2017 , Vanity Fair published an interview with Republican former House speaker John Boehner , who said of the Freedom Caucus : They cant tell you what theyre for . They can tell you everything theyre against . Theyre anarchists . They want total chaos . Tear it all down and start over . Thats where their mindset is .",
      "Impeachment proceedings against President Trump .",
      "In May 2019 , the Freedom Caucus officially condemned one of its founding members , Justin Amash , after he called for the impeachment of President Trump . Amash announced in June 2019 that he had left the caucus , saying I didnt want to be a further distraction for the group .",
      "Members of the Freedom Caucus have taken an active role in the impeachment investigation into President Trump that was launched in September 2019 . Members of the Caucus have called for the release of the full transcript of former U.S . special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker\u2019s testimony to Congress .",
      "The caucus was described as Trumps main defender during the impeachment proceedings in the House .",
      "Meadows appointment as WH chief of staff and Liz Cheney criticism .",
      "In March 2020 , former Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows was appointed as White House chief of staff , replacing Mick Mulvaney , who was also a founding member of the Freedom Caucus .",
      "Freedom Caucus members have called on Liz Cheney to resign as Chair of the House Republican Conference , due to her vocal criticism of Trumps foreign policy , response to the COVID-19 pandemic , and use of social media , leading to her firing May 12 , 2021 and replacement with Elise Stefanik two days later .",
      "2020 National Defense Authorization Act .",
      "In December 2020 , the caucus sided with Donald Trump and opposed the NDAA on the grounds that it did not include a provision to repeal Section 230 .",
      "Leadership .",
      "The current chair of the caucus is Representative Andy Biggs from Arizona , with Representative Jim Jordan as the deputy chair .",
      "Membership .",
      "Membership policy .",
      "The House Freedom Caucus does not disclose the names of its members and membership is by invitation only . The New York Times wrote in October 2015 that the caucus usually meets in the basement of a local pub rather than at the Capitol . The caucus acts as a bloc , with decisions that are supported by 80 percent made binding on all of its members , which has strengthened its influence among House Republicans .",
      "Current members .",
      "A number of members have identified themselves , or have been identified by others , as belonging to the Freedom Caucus . There are at least 53 caucus members ; those members include :",
      "Former members .",
      "In the 115th Congress , the group had about 36 members ."

      "The trailer cars were built by Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft ( SIG ) ; the design was based on the SBBs standard carriage design ( Einheitswagen I ) due to the short time available for design and construction . Only one entrance vestibule was provided at the front end of the cars , doors were of the folding aluminum type , and windows were double-glazed with a passenger-operated venetian blinds between the panes .",

One of the driving trailers was restored and displayed at the Swiss Museum of Transport in Lucerne .",

The intention is to use them again in the future after the restoration and rebuilding of the missing motor car . Shortly before the 50th anniversary of the Trans Europ Express ( June 2 1957 - June 2 2007 ) the head of one of the control cars was repainted in the old red TEE color .",

      "Design and construction .",
      "In 1938 , the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board ( ACNB ) identified the need for a general purpose local defence vessel capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties , while easy to construct and operate . The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons , a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel , with a top speed , and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun , equipped with asdic , and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations : although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel , the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels . Construction of the prototype did not go ahead , but the plans were retained . The need for locally built all-rounder vessels at the start of World War II saw the Australian Minesweepers ( designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability , but popularly referred to as corvettes ) approved in September 1939 , with 60 constructed during the course of the war : 36 ordered by the RAN , 20 ( including Cairns ) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels , and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy .",
      "Cairns was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough , Queensland on 31 March 1941 . She was launched on 7 October 1941 by Mrs . R . D . Walker , wife of the Works Manager of Walkers Limited , and commissioned into the RAN on 11 May 1942 .",
      "Operational history .",
      "Royal Australian Navy .",
      "From entering service until 16 October 1942 , Cairns was based in Fremantle and operated as a convoy escort , anti-submarine patroller , and minesweeper . On 16 October , the corvette was reassigned to the British Eastern Fleet and ordered to Kilindini , Kenya , arriving on 14 November .",
      "Cairns remained with the Eastern Fleet until January 1945 . Most of this time was spent on patrol or escort duties in the Indian Ocean . The corvette was reassigned to the Mediterranean from June until September 1943 . During this time , Cairns was involved in the Allied invasion of Sicily . On 11 February 1944 , a convoy Cairns was assigned to was attacked by Japanese submarine RO-110 . The corvette was involved in the successful destruction of the submarine , but one convoy ship was torpedoed .

      "Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner",
      "Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner ( 12 June 1892 \u2013 2 July 1973 ) was a German general and later field marshal in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany during World War II . He commanded several army groups and was the last Commander-in-chief of the German Army .",
      "Sch\u00f6rner is commonly represented in historical literature as a simple disciplinarian and a slavish devotee of Hitlers defensive orders , after Germany lost the initiative in the second half of World War II in 1942/43 . More recent research by American historian Howard Davis Grier and German historian Karl-Heinz Frieser depicts Sch\u00f6rner as a talented commander with astonishing organizational ability in managing an army group of 500,000 men during the fighting in late 1944 on the Eastern Front . He was harsh against superiors as well as subordinates and carried out operations on his own authority against Hitlers orders when he considered it necessary , such as the evacuation of the S\u00f5rve Peninsula .",
      "Sch\u00f6rner was a dedicated Nazi and became well known for his ruthlessness . By the end of World War II he was Hitlers favorite commander . Following the war he was convicted of war crimes by courts in the Soviet Union , and West Germany , and was imprisoned in the Soviet Union , East Germany and West Germany . At his death in 1973 he was the last living German field marshal . He is also considered by historians to be one of the main reasons why the German military did away with the rank of field marshal altogether .",
      "Early life .",
      "Sch\u00f6rner was born on 12 June 1892 in Munich , Kingdom of Bavaria , German Empire . He entered the Bavarian Army in October 1911 as a one-year volunteer with the Bavarian Leib Regiment , and by November 1914 he was a Leutnant der Reserve . Serving in World War I , he was awarded the Pour le M\u00e9rite military order as a lieutenant when he took part in the Battle of Caporetto , which shattered the Italian lines in autumn 1917 . Continuing in the Reichsheer , between the two wars , Sch\u00f6rner served as a staff officer and instructor . In 1923 he was adjutant to General Otto von Lossow , the commander of Wehrkreis VII ( military district ) in Munich and participated in the defeat of the Beer Hall Putsch .",
      "World War II .",
      "Sch\u00f6rner commanded the 98th Mountain Regiment in the invasion of Poland in 1939 . During the 1941 Balkans campaign , he commanded the German 6th Mountain Division and earned the Knights Cross for his role in breaching the Metaxas Line . With this division , Sch\u00f6rner took part in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 . The 6th Gebirgs Division was assigned to the Arctic sectors in the Eastern Front . In 1942 as a General der Gebirgstruppe he took command of the XIX Mountain Corps , part of the German Army in Finland . With this command he participated in the failed attack on Murmansk and the stalemate war that followed . Sch\u00f6rners task was to keep the Pechenga Nickel Works in German hands . When the Soviets opened an offensive against the Arctic sector , the division took part in the fighting . In February 1942 , Sch\u00f6rner was promoted to the rank of Generalleutnant , commanding the Mountain Corps Norway .",
      "He later commanded the XXXX Panzer Corps on the Eastern Front from November 1943 to January 1944 . In March 1944 he was made commander of Army Group A , and in May commander of Army Group South Ukraine . After stating that the Crimean port of Sevastopol could be held for a long time even if Crimea fell , he changed his mind and against Hitlers wishes , evacuated the Black Sea port . This retreat occurred too late and the German\u2013Romanian 17th Army that was holding Crimea suffered severe losses , with many men killed or captured while waiting on the piers to be evacuated . During the late spring of 1944 , Sch\u00f6rner oversaw the retreat from the Dniester River in Romania .",
      "Sch\u00f6rner was promoted to the rank of Generaloberst in May 1944 . In July he became commander of Army Group North , which was later renamed Army Group Courland , where he stayed until January 1945 when he was made commander of Army Group Centre , defending Czechoslovakia and the upper reaches of the River Oder . He became a favorite of high-level Nazi leaders such as Joseph Goebbels , whose diary entries from March and April 1945 have many words of praise for Sch\u00f6rner and his methods . On 5 April 1945 , Sch\u00f6rner was promoted to field marshal and was named as the new Commander-in-Chief of the German Army High Command ( OKH ) in Hitlers last testament . He nominally served in this post until the surrender of the Third Reich on 8 May 1945 but continued to command his army group , since no staff was available to him . He did not have any discernible influence in the final days of the Reich .",
      "On 7 May , the day General Alfred Jodl , Chief-of-Staff of the OKW was negotiating the surrender of all German forces at SHAEF , the last the OKW had heard from Sch\u00f6rner was on 2 May . He had reported he intended to fight his way west and surrender his army group to the Americans . On 8 May , OKW colonel Wilhelm Meyer-Detring was escorted through the American lines to contact Sch\u00f6rner . The colonel reported that Sch\u00f6rner had ordered his operational command to observe the surrender but he could not guarantee that he would be obeyed everywhere . Sch\u00f6rner ordered a continuation of fighting against Red Army and the Czech insurgents of the Prague uprising . Later that day , Sch\u00f6rner deserted and flew to Austria , where he was arrested by the Americans on 18 May . Elements of Army Group Centre continued to resist the overwhelming force of the Red Army invading Czechoslovakia during the final Prague Offensive . Units of Army Group Centre , the last big German units to surrender , capitulated on 11 May 1945 .",
      "Post-war trials and convictions .",
      "With the war over , on 18 May 1945 Sch\u00f6rner handed himself in to the Americans , who a few weeks later passed him over to the Soviet authorities as a prisoner of war . In August 1951 he was charged with war crimes , and in February 1952 the Military Board of the Soviet Supreme Court sentenced him to 25 years imprisonment . A decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in April 1952 reduced this sentence to 12 and a half years . A decree of December 1954 allowed him to be handed over to authorities of East Germany , and he was released in 1955 . Returning to West Germany , he was arrested and charged with executions of German Army soldiers accused of desertion , found guilty and sentenced to four and a half years jail . Sch\u00f6rner was released on August 4 , 1960 and lived in obscurity in Munich until his death in 1973 . In the late 1960s he gave a lengthy interview to Italian historian Mario Silvestri on his role and actions during the Austro-German victory at the Battle of Caporetto in World War I , but rarely spoke about his World War II service .",
      "Assessment .",
      "German veterans particularly criticized Sch\u00f6rner for a 1945 order that all soldiers found behind the front lines , who did not possess written orders to be there , were to be court-martialled on the spot and hanged if found guilty of desertion . This is mentioned in the writings of Siegfried Knappe , Hans von Luck and Joseph Goebbels . Deserters get no mercy from him Goebbels wrote of Sch\u00f6rner on 11 March 1945 . They are hanged from the nearest tree with a placard round their necks saying I am a deserter . I have declined to defend German women and children and therefore I have been hanged . ( Ich bin ein Deserteur . Ich habe mich geweigert , deutsche Frauen und Kinder zu besch\u00fctzen und bin deshalb aufgeh\u00e4ngt worden. ) Goebbels continued with , Naturally such methods are effective . Every man in Sch\u00f6rners area knows that he may die at the front but will inevitably die in the rear .",
      "Gottlob Bidermann , a German infantry officer who served in Sch\u00f6rners command in 1944\u201345 , reported in his memoirs that the General was despised by officers and men alike .",
      "Sch\u00f6rner was said to be devoted to Hitler , a view that is seen as confirmed by Hitlers appointment of Sch\u00f6rner as his replacement as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army on his suicide in the Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler . Sch\u00f6rner did not hesitate to second Hitlers fantasy in the last weeks of the war , agreeing that the Red Armys main objective would be Prague instead of Berlin ( in itself a colossal strategic blunder ) and so leading him to weaken the critically thin defense lines in front of Berlin . Historian Ian Kershaw described him in 2011 ( BBC History Magazine ) as extraordinarily brutal .",
      "In ( 2012 ) Kershaw describes Sch\u00f6rner as a fanatical ( Nazi ) loyalist , an indication of this being that he had served for a brief spell in March 1944 as Chief of the NS Leadership Staff of the Army . The latter was responsible for coordinating relations between the military and the Nazi Party .",

      "MS Costa Allegra",
      "Costa Allegra , formerly Annie Johnson , was a cruise ship owned by the Italy-based Costa Cruises , one of many subsidiaries owned by Costas parent company Carnival Corporation . She was built in 1969 by the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Turku Shipyard in Turku , Finland , as a container ship for the Johnson Line services of Sweden-based Rederi AB Nordstjernan . In 1986 she was sold to Regency Cruises with the intention of being converted into a cruise ship as Regent Moon , but she was laid up instead . In 1988 she was sold to Compania Naviera Panalexandra and renamed Alexandra but continued laid up . In 1990 , the ship was acquired by Costa Cruises and rebuilt into a cruise ship at the T . Mariotti shipyard in Genoa , Italy . She entered service as Costa Allegra in 1992 .",
      "Costa Allegra suffered a generator fire while off the coast of Africa approximately 200 miles southwest of the Seychelles on 27 February 2012 and was taken into tow toward the island of Mah\u00e9 in the Seychelles Islands the following day , a journey of several days . She was later renamed Santa Cruise and sold for breaking in Aliaga , Turkey . Prior to beaching at the scrapyard , her yellow funnel , a trademark of Costa Crociere , was painted white .",
      "Career .",
      "Annie Johnson .",
      "Annie Johnson was the second in a series of five container ships built by the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Turku Shipyard in Finland for the Swedish shipping company Rederi AB Nordstjernan . She was launched on 29 April 1969 and delivered to her owners on 4 December of the same year , entering service on the same date .",
      "From 1969 until 1986 , Annie Johnson was used as in cargo services by Rederi AB Nordstjernan . On 8 August 1986 the ship was sold to the Greece-based Regency Cruises with the intention of being rebuilt as a cruise ship . With this aim in mind , she was renamed Regent Moon . Her sister ship was sold to Regency Cruises at the same time , renamed Regent Sun , also with the intention of being converted into a cruise ship . These plans were never realised , and Regent Moon was laid up in Perama , Greece . In May 1988 Regent Moon was sold to Compania Naviera Panalexandra and renamed Alexandra , but continued laid up until 1990 when she was sold to Costa Crociere .",
      "Costa Allegra .",
      "Costa Crociere acquired Regent Sun which was renamed Italia in the interim , in 1988 and had her conversion into a cruise ship realised , with the ship being delivered in July 1990 as Costa Marina . Following this Costa Crociere acquired Alexandra on 28 August 1990 for conversion into a cruise ship at the T . Mariotti shipyard in Genoa , Italy , the same shipyard that had rebuilt Costa Marina . Work on Alexandra commenced on 4 September 1990 . She received an entirely new superstructure in the same style as that of Costa Marina , as well as new engines . However , unlike Costa Marina , Alexandra was also lengthened by when rebuilt . Although originally planned to be renamed Costa Azzurra , the ship was eventually named Costa Allegra and delivered to Costa Cruises on 16 November 1992 .",
      "Costa Allegra entered service with Costa Crociere on 23 November 1992 with a cruise from Genoa to St . Thomas in the Caribbean . During the early years of her service with Costa she sailed in the Mediterranean during the northern hemisphere summer season , relocating to the Caribbean for the winter . In 2006 the ship was relocated for cruising out of China . At the same time her interiors were refurbished to better suit the Asian cruise market . Her ports of departure in Asia were Singapore and Hong Kong . Countries visited included China , South Korea , Japan , Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia , Thailand and Indonesia .",
      "In 2010 , the ship was relocated back to Europe , and her Asian itineraries were replaced by Costa Classica and Costa Romantica . In an agreement with TMR of Marseilles , Costa Cruises , who had owned the Paquet Cruises brand since 1996 , used Costa Allegra , marketed in France under the name Allegra and the Paquet Cruises brand , for four spring cruises and seven cruises in autumn of 2010 . For these cruises , Costa Allegra featured a French master , cruise director , maitres d , receptionists and two French chefs , one of whom , Jean Abauzit , served on board the renowned Mermoz , retired a decade earlier .",
      "2012 fire .",
      "During the morning of 27 February 2012 , a fire broke out in the generator room . The fire was extinguished by the on-board fire-suppression system and there were no injuries , but the ship was left without power and adrift about 200 miles southwest of the Seychelles . She was towed by the French tuna-fishing vessel Trevignon , from the Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise du Thon Oc\u00e9anique ( CFTO ) based in Concarneau , to Mah\u00e9 in the Seychelles for repair and evacuation of the passengers . 1049 people , 636 passengers and 413 crew members of various nationalities were on board . Costa Cruises announced Costa Voyager would assume Costa Allegras planned voyages from 18 March to 1 July . Following on 9 March 2012 , it was announced that the Costa Allegra would not return to service with Costa and given to Themis Maritime Ltd ship company as Santa Cruise for scrapping at Aliaga , Turkey . Her story was a part of a feature on the scrapping operations of Aliaga in the January/February issue of Cruise Travel Magazine .",
      "Design .",
      "The eight decks on Costa Allegra were named after famous impressionist painters . A three deck high glass atrium was the centre of the ship . Works of art could be found throughout the ship ."

      "Amalric of Jerusalem",
      "Amalric ( ; ; 113611 July 1174 ) was King of Jerusalem from 1163 , and Count of Jaffa and Ascalon before his accession . He was the second son of Melisende and Fulk of Jerusalem , and succeeded his older brother Baldwin III . During his reign , Jerusalem became more closely allied with the Byzantine Empire , and the two states launched an unsuccessful invasion of Egypt . Meanwhile , the Muslim territories surrounding Jerusalem began to be united under Nur ad-Din and later Saladin . He was the father of three future rulers of Jerusalem , Sibylla , Baldwin IV , and Isabella I .",
      "Older scholarship mistook the two names Amalric and Aimery as variant spellings of the same name , so these historians erroneously added numbers , making Amalric to be Amalric I ( 1163\u201374 ) and King Aimery ( 1197\u20131205 ) to be Amalric II . Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king . Confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries .",
      "Youth .",
      "Amalric was born in 1136 to King Fulk , the former count of Anjou married to the heiress of the kingdom , Queen Melisende . After the death of Fulk in a hunting accident in 1143 , the throne passed jointly to Melisende and Amalrics older brother Baldwin III , who was still only 13 years old . Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age two years later , and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other . In 1152 Baldwin had himself crowned sole king , and civil war broke out , with Melisende retaining Jerusalem while Baldwin held territory further north . Amalric , who had been given the County of Jaffa as an apanage when he reached the age of majority in 1151 , remained loyal to Melisende in Jerusalem , and when Baldwin invaded the south , Amalric was besieged in the Tower of David with his mother . Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter . In 1153 Baldwin captured the Egyptian fortress of Ascalon , which was then added to Amalrics fief of Jaffa ( see Battle of Ascalon ) .",
      "Amalric married Agnes of Courtenay in 1157 . Agnes , daughter of Joscelin II of Edessa , had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader County of Edessa were lost in 1150 . Patriarch Fulcher objected to the marriage on grounds of consanguinity , as the two shared a great-great-grandfather , Guy I of Montlh\u00e9ry , and it seems that they waited until Fulchers death to marry . Agnes bore Amalric three children : Sibylla , the future Baldwin IV ( both of whom would come to rule the kingdom in their own right ) , and Alix , who died in childhood .",
      "Succession .",
      "Baldwin III died on 10 February 1163 and the kingdom passed to Amalric , although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes ; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir , but now the Haute Cour refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled . The hostility to Agnes , it must be admitted , may be exaggerated by the chronicler William of Tyre , whom she prevented from becoming Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem decades later , as well as from Williams continuators like Ernoul , who hints at a slight on her moral character : car telle nest que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem ( there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem ) . Nevertheless , consanguinity was enough for the opposition . Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife , although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fiefs income . Agnes soon thereafter married Hugh of Ibelin , to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric . The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession . Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years .",
      "Conflicts with the Muslim states .",
      "During Baldwin IIIs reign , the County of Edessa , the first crusader state established during the First Crusade , was conquered by Zengi , the Turkic emir of Aleppo . Zengi united Aleppo , Mosul , and other cities of northern Syria , and intended to impose his control on Damascus in the south . The Second Crusade in 1148 had failed to conquer Damascus , which soon fell to Zengis son Nur ad-Din . Jerusalem also lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch . Jerusalem thus turned its attention to Egypt , where the Fatimid dynasty was suffering from a series of young caliphs and civil wars . The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of Baldwin I , who died during an expedition there . The capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III made the conquest of Egypt more feasible .",
      "Invasions of Egypt .",
      "Amalric led his first expedition into Egypt in 1163 , claiming that the Fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of Baldwin III . The vizier , Dirgham , had recently overthrown the vizier Shawar , and marched out to meet Amalric at Pelusium , but was defeated and forced to retreat to Bilbeis . The Egyptians then opened up the Nile dams and let the river flood , hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further . Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din , who sent his general Shirkuh to settle the dispute in 1164 . In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric , but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed . Shawar , however , feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself , and he too looked to Amalric for assistance . Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus .",
      "Amalric could not follow up on his success in Egypt because Nur ad-Din was active in Syria , having taken Bohemund III of Antioch and Raymond III of Tripoli prisoner at the Battle of Harim during Amalrics absence . Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemunds ransom in 1165 ( Raymond remained in captivity until 1173 ) . The year 1166 was relatively quiet , but Amalric sent envoys to the Byzantine Empire seeking an alliance and a Byzantine wife , and throughout the year had to deal with raids by Nur ad-Din , who captured Banias .",
      "In 1167 , Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt and Amalric once again followed him , establishing a camp near Cairo ; Shawar again allied with Amalric and a treaty was signed with the caliph al-Adid himself . Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the Nile . After an indecisive battle , Amalric retreated to Cairo and Shirkuh marched north to capture Alexandria ; Amalric followed and besieged Shirkuh there , aided by a Pisan fleet from Jerusalem . Shirkuh negotiated for peace and Alexandria was handed over to Amalric . However , Amalric could not remain there indefinitely , and returned to Jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute .",
      "Byzantine alliance .",
      "After his return to Jerusalem in 1167 , Amalric married Maria Comnena , a great-grandniece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus . The negotiations had taken two years , mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return Antioch to Jerusalem . Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in Tyre on August 29 , 1167 . During this time the queen dowager , Baldwin IIIs widow Theodora , eloped with her cousin Andronicus to Damascus , and Acre , which had been in her possession , reverted into the royal domain of Jerusalem . It was also around this time that William of Tyre was promoted to archdeacon of Tyre , and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom .",
      "In 1168 Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt , and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to Constantinople to finalize the treaty . Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar , Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din , and Amalric invaded . The Knights Hospitaller eagerly supported this invasion , while the Knights Templar refused to have any part in it . In October , without waiting for any Byzantine assistance ( and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return ) , Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis . The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved . Amalric then marched to Cairo , where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold . Meanwhile , Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well , and upon his arrival Amalric retreated .",
      "Rise of Saladin .",
      "In January 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated . Shirkuh became vizier , although he himself died in March , and was succeeded by his nephew Saladin . Amalric became alarmed and sent Frederick de la Roche , Archbishop of Tyre , to seek help from the kings and nobles of Europe , but no assistance was forthcoming . Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived , and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged Damietta by sea and by land . The siege was long and famine broke out in the Christian camp ; the Byzantines and crusaders blamed each other for the failure , and a truce was signed with Saladin . Amalric returned home .",
      "Now Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies . In 1170 Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of Eilat , severing Jerusalems connection with the Red Sea . Saladin , who was set up as Vizier of Egypt , was declared Sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last Fatimid caliph . Saladins rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem , as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal . Nevertheless , in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time , but again no help was received . Over the next few years the kingdom was threatened not only by Saladin and Nur ad-Din , but also by the Assassins . In one episode , the Knights Templar murdered some Assassin envoys , leading to further disputes between Amalric and the Templars .",
      "Death .",
      "Nur ad-Din died in 1174 , upon which Amalric immediately besieged Banias . On the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from dysentery , which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in Jerusalem . William of Tyre explains that after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days , he ordered physicians of the Greek , Syrian , and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy . Neither they nor Latin doctors could help , and he died on July 11 , 1174 .",
      "Maria Comnena had borne Amalric two daughters : Isabella , who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen , was born in 1172 ; and a stillborn child some time later . On his deathbed Amalric bequeathed Nablus to Maria and Isabella , both of whom would retire there . The leprous child Baldwin IV succeeded his father and brought his mother Agnes of Courtenay ( now married to her fourth husband ) back to court .",
      "Physical characteristics .",
      "William was a good friend of Amalric and described him in great detail . He had a slight impediment in his speech , not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence . He was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech . Like his brother Baldwin III , he was more of an academic than a warrior , who studied law and languages in his leisure time : He was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed \u2013 in fact , he was second to no one in this respect . He was probably responsible for an assize making all rear-vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the Haute Cour . Amalric had an enormous curiosity , and William was reportedly astonished to find Amalric questioning , during an illness , the resurrection of the body . He especially enjoyed reading and being read to , spending long hours listening to William read early drafts of his history . He did not enjoy games or spectacles , although he liked to hunt . He was trusting of his officials , perhaps too trusting , and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him , although he refused to take any action against those who insulted him publicly .",
      "He was tall and fairly handsome ; he had sparkling eyes of medium size ; his nose , like that of his brother , was becomingly aquiline ; his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead . A comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin . He had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook . He did not overeat or drink to excess , but his corpulence grew in his later years , decreasing his interest in military operations ; according to William , he was excessively fat , with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist .",
      "Amalric was pious and attended mass every day , although he also is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women.. . Despite his piety he taxed the clergy , which they naturally opposed .",
      "As William says , he was a man of wisdom and discretion , fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom . He is considered the last of the early kings of Jerusalem . Within a few years , Emperor Manuel died as well , and Saladin remained the only strong leader in the east .",

      "Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game",
      "The Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game is a role-playing game created and written by Erick Wujcik , set in the fictional universe created by author Roger Zelazny for his Chronicles of Amber . The game is unusual in that no dice are used in resolving conflicts or player actions ; instead a simple diceless system of comparative ability , and narrative description of the action by the players and gamemaster , is used to determine how situations are resolved .",
      "Amber DRPG was created in the 1980s , and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era . Most Amber characters are members of the two ruling classes in the Amber multiverse , and are much more advanced in matters of strength , endurance , psyche , warfare and sorcery than ordinary beings . This often means that the only individuals who are capable of opposing a character are from his or her family , a fact that leads to much suspicion and intrigue .",
      "History .",
      "Erick Wujcik offered to design an Amber role-playing game for West End Games , who agreed to look at his work . Wujcik intended to integrate the feel of the Amber setting from the novels into a role-playing game , and playtested his system for a few months at the Michigan Gaming Center where he decided to try it out as a diceless game . West End was not interested in a diceless role-playing game , so Wujcik acquired the RPG rights to Amber and took the game to R . Talsorian Games , until he withdrew over creative differences . Wujcik then founded Phage Press , and published Amber Diceless Role-playing in 1991 .",
      "The original 256-page game book was published in 1991 by Phage Press , covering material from the first five novels ( the Corwin Cycle ) and some details \u2013 sorcery and the Logrus \u2013 from the remaining five novels ( the Merlin Cycle ) , in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the Courts of Chaos . Some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice \u2013 for example , players can be full Trump Artists without having walked the Pattern or the Logrus , which Merlin says is impossible ; and players psychic abilities are far greater than those shown in the books .",
      "A 256-page companion volume , Shadow Knight , was published in 1993 . This supplemental rule book includes the remaining elements from the Merlin novels , such as Broken Patterns , and allows players to create Constructs such as Merlins Ghostwheel . The book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series continuity but as an example of a roleplaying campaign with Merlin , Luke , Julia , Jurt and Coral as the PCs . The remainder of the book is a collection of essays on the game , statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series , and ( perhaps most usefully for GMs ) plot summaries of each of the ten books . The book includes some material from the short story The Salesmans Tale , and some unpublished material cut from Prince of Chaos , notably Corals pregnancy by Merlin .",
      "Both books were translated into French and published by Jeux Descartes in 1994 and 1995 .",
      "A third book , Rebma , was promised . Cover art was commissioned and pre-orders were taken , but it was never published . Wujcik also expressed a desire to create a book giving greater detail to the Courts of Chaos . The publishing rights to the Amber DRPG games were acquired in 2004 by Guardians of Order , who took over sales of the game and announced their intention to release a new edition of the game . However , no new edition was released before Guardians of Order went out of business in 2006 . The two existing books are now out-of-print , but they have been made available as PDF downloads .",
      "In June 2007 a new publishing company , headed by Edwin Voskamp and Eric Todd , was formed with the express purpose of bringing Amber DRPG back into print . The new company is named Diceless by Design .",
      "In May 2010 , Rite Publishing secured a license from Diceless by Design to use the rules system with a new setting in the creation of a new product to be written by industry and system veteran Jason Durall . The project Lords of Gossamer & Shadow ( Diceless ) was funded via Kickstarter in May 2013 . In Sept 2013 the project was completed , and on in Nov 2013 Lords of Gossamer and Shadow ( Diceless ) was released publicly in full-color Print and PDF , along with additional supplements and continued support .",
      "Setting .",
      "The game is set in the multiverse described in Zelaznys Chronicles of Amber . The first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the Patternfall war ; that is , after the end of the fifth book in the series , The Courts of Chaos , but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of Zelaznys cosmology that were featured there in more detail . The Amber multiverse consists of Amber , a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found the Pattern , the symbol of Order ; The Courts of Chaos , an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found the Logrus , the manifestation of Chaos , and the Abyss , the source or end of all reality ; and Shadow , the collection of all possible universes ( shadows ) between and around them . Inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the Pattern and the Logrus to travel through Shadow .",
      "It is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books \u2013 the ruling family of Amber , known as the Elder Amberites \u2013 or a resident of the Courts . However , since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting , it is fairly common to either start with King Oberons death before the book begins and roleplay the Elder Amberites as they vie for the throne ; or to populate Amber from scratch with a different set of Elder Amberites . The former option is one presented in the book ; the latter is known in the Amber community as an Amethyst game . A third option is to have the players portray Corwins children , in an Amber-like city built around Corwins pattern ; this is sometimes called an Argent game , since one of Corwins heraldic colours is Silver .",
      "System .",
      "Attributes .",
      "Characters in Amber DRPG are represented by four attributes : Psyche , Strength , Endurance and Warfare .",
      "- Psyche is used for feats of willpower or magic",
      "- Strength is used for feats of strength or unarmed combat",
      "- Endurance is used for feats of endurance",
      "- Warfare is used for armed combat , from duelling to commanding armies",
      "The attributes run from \u221225 ( normal human level ) , through \u221210 ( normal level for a denizen of the Courts of Chaos ) and 0 ( normal level for an inhabitant of Amber ) , upwards without limit . Scores above 0 are ranked , with the highest score being ranked 1st , the next-highest 2nd , and so on . The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered superior in that attribute , being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small . All else being equal , a character with a higher rank in an attribute will always win a contest based on that attribute .",
      "The Attribute Auction .",
      "A characters ability scores are purchased during character creation in an auction ; players get 100 character points , and bid on each attribute in turn . The character who bids the most for an attribute is ranked first and is considered superior to all other characters in that attribute . Unlike conventional auctions , bids are non-refundable ; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66 , then the character with 66 is superior to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference . Instead , lower bidding characters are ranked in ascending order according to how much they have bid , the characters becoming progressively weaker in that attribute as they pay less for it . After the auction , players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks , but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank . Further , a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank .",
      "The Auction simulates a history of competition between the descendants of Oberon for player characters who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other . Through the competitive Auction , characters may begin the game vying for standings . The auction serves to introduce some unpredictability into character creation without the need to resort to dice , cards , or other randomizing devices . A player may intend , for example , to create a character who is a strong , mighty warrior , but being outplayed in the auction may result in lower attribute scores than anticipated , therefore necessitating a change of character concept . Since a player cannot control another players bids , and since all bids are non-refundable , the auction involves a considerable amount of strategizing and prioritization by players . A willingness to spend as many points as possible on an attribute may improve your chances of a high ranking , but too reckless a spending strategy could leave a player with few points to spend on powers and objects . In a hotly contested auction , such as for the important attribute of warfare , the most valuable skill is the ability to force ones opponents to back down . With two or more equally determined players , this can result in a bidding war where the attribute is driven up by increments to large sums . An alternative strategy is to try to cow other players into submission with a high opening bid . Most players bid low amounts between one and ten points in an initial bid in order to feel out the competition and to save points for other uses . A high enough opening bid could signal a players determination to be first ranked in that attribute , thereby dissuading others from competing .",
      "Psyche in Amber DRPG compared to the Chronicles .",
      "Characters with high psyche are presented as having strong telepathic abilities , being able to hypnotise and even mentally dominate any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact . This is likely due to three scenes in the Chronicles : first , when Eric paralyzes Corwin with an attack across the Trump and refuses to desist because one or the other would be dominated ; second , when Corwin faces the demon Strygalldwir , it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet ; and third , when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos . However , in general , the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact ( for example , Trump contact ) and magic or Trump is involved in all three of the above conflicts , so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power ; the combination of Brands living trump powers and his high Psyche ( as presented in the roleplaying game ) would have guaranteed him victory over Corwin . Shadow Knight does address this inconsistency somewhat , by presenting the living trump abilities as somewhat limited .",
      "Powers .",
      "Characters in Amber DRPG have access to the powers seen in the Chronicles of Amber : Pattern , Logrus , Shape-shifting , Trump , and magic .",
      "- Pattern : A character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe , and while there can manipulate probability .",
      "- Logrus : A character who has mastered the Logrus can send out Logrus tendrils and pull themselves or objects through shadow .",
      "- Shape-shifting : Shape-shifters can alter their physical form and abilities .",
      "- Trump : Trump Artists can create Trumps , a sort of tarot card which allows mental communication and travel . The book features Trump portraits of each of the elder Amberites . The trump picture of Corwin is executed in a subtly different style \u2013 and has features very similar to Roger Zelaznys .",
      "- Magic : Three types of magic are detailed : Power Words , with a quick , small effect ; Sorcery , with pre-prepared spells as in many other game systems ; and Conjuration , the creation of small objects .",
      "Each of the first four powers is available in an advanced form .",
      "Artifacts , Personal shadows and Constructs .",
      "While a character with Pattern , Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object , players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues \u2013 unbreakability , or a mind of their own . Since they have paid points for the items , they are a part of the characters legend , and cannot lightly be destroyed . Similarly , a character can find any possible universe , but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are ( in some sense ) real and therefore useful . The expansion , Shadow Knight , adds Constructs \u2013 artifacts with connections to shadows .",
      "Stuff .",
      "Unspent character points become good stuff \u2013 a good luck for the character . Players are also allowed to overspend ( in moderation ) , with the points becoming bad stuff \u2013 bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character . Stuff governs how non-player characters perceive and respond to the character : characters with good stuff will often receive friendly or helpful reactions , while characters with bad stuff are often treated with suspicion or hostility .",
      "As well as representing luck , stuff can be seen as representing a characters outlook on the universe : characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place , while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile .",
      "Conflict resolution .",
      "In any given fair conflict between two characters , the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win . The key words here are fair and eventually \u2013 if characters ranks are close , and the weaker character has obtained some advantage , then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail . Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution . Alternatively , if characters attribute ranks are close , the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict . For example , if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength ; a character could reveal a weapon , changing it to Warfare ; they could try to overcome the other characters mind using a power , changing it to Psyche ; or they could concentrate their strength on defense , changing it to Endurance . If there is a substantial difference between characters ranks , the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react .",
      "The Golden Rule .",
      "Amber DRPG advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit \u2013 even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes .",
      "Reception .",
      "In the June 1992 edition of Dragon ( Issue 182 ) , both Lester Smith and Allen Varney published reviews of this game .",
      "- Smith admired the professional production qualities of the 256-page rulebook , noting that because it was Smyth sewn in 32-page signatures , the book would always lie flat when opened . However , he found the typeface difficult to read , and the lack a coherent hierarchy of rules increased the reading difficulty as well . Smith admired the Attribute Auction and point-buy system for skills , and the focus on roleplaying in place of dice-rolling , but he mused that all of the roleplaying would mean GMs have to spend quite a bit of time and creative effort coming up with wide-reaching plots for their players to work through . Canned , linear adventures just won\u2019t serve . He concluded by stating that the diceless system is not for every gamer : As impressed as I am with the game , do I think it is the end-all of role-playing games , or that diceless systems are the wave of the future ? I\u2019ll give a firm \u201cNo\u201d on both counts.. . However , I certainly do think that the Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game is destined for great popularity and a niche among the most respected of role-playing game designs .",
      "- Allen Varney thought the Attribute Auction to be brilliant and elegant , but he wondered if character advancement was perhaps too slow to keep marginal players interested . He also believed that being a gamemaster would be tough work . Proceed with caution . Varney recommended that players need some familiarity with the first five Amber novels by Zelazny . He concluded , The intensity of the Amber game indicates [ game designer Erik ] Wujcik is on to something . When success in every action depends on the role and not the roll , players develop a sense of both control and urgency , along with creativity that borders on mania .",
      "Loyd Blankenship reviewed Amber in Pyramid #2 ( July/Aug. , 1993 ) , and stated that Amber is a valuable resource to a GM - even if he isnt running an Amber game . For gamers who have an aspiring actor or actress lurking within their breast , or for someone running a campaign via electronic mail or message base , Amber should be given serious consideration .",
      "Community .",
      "Despite the games out-of-print status , a thriving convention scene exists supporting the game . Amber conventions , known as Ambercons , are held yearly in Massachusetts , Michigan , Portland ( United States ) , Milton Keynes ( England ) , Belfast ( Northern Ireland ) and Modena , Italy . Additionally , Phage Press published 12 volumes of a dedicated Amber DRPG magazine called Amberzine . Some Amberzine issues are still available from Phage Press .",

      "Republic of Cospaia",
      "The Republic of Cospaia ( local dialect : Republica de Co\u0161p\u00e4ja ) was a small state within modern-day Italy , located in northern Umbria , independent from 1440 to 1826 . It was located in what is now the hamlet ( frazione ) of Cospaia in the comune of San Giustino in the Province of Perugia .",
      "History .",
      "It unexpectedly gained independence in 1440 after Pope Eugene IV , embroiled in a struggle with the Council of Basel , made a sale of territory to the Republic of Florence . By error , a small strip of land went unmentioned in the sale treaty and its inhabitants declared themselves independent .",
      "The misunderstanding arose from the fact that , about 500 meters from the stream that was to establish the demarcation ( simply called Rio ) , there was a homonymous stream . The delegates of the Florentine republic considered the Rio which was located further north as the new delimitation , whereas the delegates of the Papal States considered it the one further south . Thus a sort of terra nullius was formed whose inhabitants declared themselves independent , no longer subject to any authority . In 1484 its autonomy was formally recognized by both Florence and the Papal States , considering it not worth the trouble to redraw treaties in regard to an already complicated border .",
      "On May 25 , 1826 , Cospaia was divided between Tuscany and the Papal States . The treaty was signed by the fourteen remaining family heads of Cospaia , in exchange for a silver coin , and being allowed to grow up to half a million tobacco plants a year .",
      "Birth of the republic .",
      "The republican form of government was extremely rare until the French Revolution . There were maritime republics ( with aristocratic institutions ) , the Republic of San Marino and alleged Republic of Senarica ( in Abruzzo ) , with an elected doge akin to the system used in Venice , but its real existence has not been historically proven with proper documentation .",
      "The cospaiesi , therefore , preferred to base their independence on the total freedom of the inhabitants , all holders of sovereignty , not entrusted to any organ of power , unlike in states . Cospaia also had an official flag , which is still used on some occasions . The banner was characterized by a black and a white field , divided diagonally . In the coat of arms there appeared the village between the two small streams , with two fish on the right and the plant of Nicotiana tabacum on the left , above was the motto and years of the republic .",
      "The cospaiesi did not , therefore , have tribute obligations with either the Papal States nor the Grand Duchy of Tuscany , and the goods that passed through the territory were not subject to any tariffs ; it was therefore a free economic zone and buffer state between the two powers . Although Cospaia extended over just 330 hectares ( 2 kilometers long and about 500 meters wide ) , the 250 inhabitants treasured the situation and took advantage of it to increase the cultivation of tobacco , among the first in the Italian peninsula . Even now , some varieties of tobacco are defined with the name of cospaia .",
      "Cospaia was an early centre of tobacco production within Italy , using 25 hectares of fertile soil to grow it . One of the reasons for the prosperity of Cospaia was that it was the only place in Italy that didnt follow with the papal ban on tobacco growing , thus ensuring a monopoly on production .",
      "Form of government .",
      "The Republic of Cospaia did not have a formal government or official legal system . There were no jails or prisons and there was no standing army or police force . At the head of the administration , there was the Council of Elders and Family Heads , which was summoned for decision making and judicial duties . The curate of San Lorenzo also took part in the meetings of the Council of Elders , as president , a position shared with a member of the Valenti family , the most important in the country . Council meetings were held in the Valenti house until 1718 , when the council began to meet in the Church of the Annunciation , where they would stay until the republics dissolution . On the architrave of the church door one can still read the only written law of the tiny republic : Perpetua et firma libertas , or Perpetual and secure freedom . The Latin phrase referred to was also engraved on the parish bell .",
      "After several centuries of existence , Cospaia was reduced to a mere receptacle of contraband . The concept of freedom was somewhat tarnished in favor of its privileges , which attracted people of all kinds , for economic reasons or to escape the justice of the two large adjacent states . This situation was not unusual in the small states , especially in the border ones .",
      "End of the republic .",
      "After the end of the Napoleonic Era , on 26 June 1826 , with an act of submission by fourteen representatives of the republic , Cospaia became part of the Papal States : every Cospaiese , as compensation , obtained a papal silver coin and the authorization to continue tobacco cultivation , which was taken over by rich local landowners such as the Collacchioni and the Giovagnoli , who bought most of the territory contained within the borders of the former republic . They then extended tobacco production to the whole valley , imposing it as the principal agricultural commodity ."

      "Scottish National Party",
      "The Scottish National Party ( SNP ; , ) is a Scottish nationalist , regionalist , and social-democratic political party in Scotland . The SNP supports and campaigns for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom and for membership of the European Union , with a platform based on civic nationalism . The SNP is the largest political party in Scotland , where it has the most seats in the Scottish Parliament and 45 out of the 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons at Westminster , and it is the third-largest political party by membership in the United Kingdom , behind the Labour Party and the Conservative Party . The current Scottish National Party leader , Nicola Sturgeon , has served as First Minister of Scotland since 20 November 2014 .",
      "Founded in 1934 with the amalgamation of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party , the party has had continuous parliamentary representation in Westminster since Winnie Ewing won the 1967 Hamilton by-election . With the establishment of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 , the SNP became the second-largest party , serving two terms as the opposition . The SNP gained power under Alex Salmond at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election , forming a minority government , before going on to win the 2011 Parliament election , after which it formed Holyroods first majority government . After losing the 2014 Scottish independence referendum , Salmond resigned and was succeeded by Sturgeon . The SNP was reduced back to being a minority government at the 2016 election .",
      "The SNP is the largest political party in Scotland in terms of both seats in the Westminster and Holyrood parliaments , and membership , reaching 125,691 members as of March 2021 , 45 Members of Parliament ( MPs ) , 64 Members of the Scottish Parliament ( MSPs ) and 400 local councillors . The SNP is a member of the European Free Alliance ( EFA ) . The party does not have any members of the House of Lords , as it has always maintained a position of objecting to an unelected upper house .",
      "History .",
      "Foundation and early breakthroughs ( 1934\u20131970 ) .",
      "The SNP was formed in 1934 through the merger of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party , with the Duke of Montrose and Cunninghame Graham as its first , joint , presidents . Sir Alexander MacEwen was its first chairman . Professor Douglas Young , who was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945 campaigned for the Scottish people to refuse conscription and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the British war effort against the Axis powers . Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted .",
      "The party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942 , owing to his failure to change the partys policy from supporting all-out independence to Home Rule at that years conference in Glasgow . McCormick went on to form the Scottish Covenant Association , a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly .",
      "However , wartime conditions also enabled the SNPs first parliamentary success at the Motherwell by-election in 1945 , but Robert McIntyre MP lost the seat at the general election three months later . The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support , and this made it difficult for the party to advance . Indeed , in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates .",
      "The 1960s , however , offered more electoral successes , with candidates polling credibly at Glasgow Bridgeton in 1961 , West Lothian in 1962 and Glasgow Pollok in 1967 . Indeed , this foreshadowed Winnie Ewings surprise victory in a by-election at the previously safe Labour seat of Hamilton . This brought the SNP to national prominence , leading to the establishment of the Kilbrandon Commission .",
      "Becoming a major force ( 1970s ) .",
      "Despite this breakthrough , the 1970 general election was to prove a disappointment for the party as , despite an increase in vote share , Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton . The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the Western Isles , making Donald Stewart the partys only MP . This was to be the case until the 1973 by-election at Glasgow Govan where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by Margo MacDonald .",
      "1974 was to prove something of an annus mirabilis for the party as it deployed its highly effective Its Scotlands oil campaign . The SNP gained 6 seats at the February general election before hitting a high point in the October re-run , polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster . Furthermore , during that years local elections the party claimed overall control of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth .",
      "This success was to continue for much of the decade , and at the 1977 district elections the SNP saw victories at councils including East Kilbride and Falkirk and held the balance of power in Glasgow . However , this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ( Glasgow Garscadden , Hamilton and Berwick and East Lothian ) as well as the regional elections .",
      "This was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the 1979 general election , precipitated by the party bringing down the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that years devolution referendum . Reduced to just 2 MPs , the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the 2015 general election .",
      "Factional divisions and infighting ( 1980s ) .",
      "Following this defeat , a period of internal strife occurred within the party , culminating with the formation of two internal groups : the ultranationalist Siol nan Gaidheal and left-wing 79 Group . Traditionalists within the party , centred around Winnie Ewing , by this time an MEP , responded by establishing the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation , even though this would have undone the work of figures such as William Wolfe , who developed a clearly social democratic policy platform throughout the 1970s .",
      "These events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the partys annual conference of 1982 , in Ayr , despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of Jim Sillars Scottish Labour Party ( SLP ) although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards . Despite this , traditionalist figure Gordon Wilson remained party leader through the electoral disappointments of 1983 and 1987 , where he lost his own Dundee East seat won 13 years prior .",
      "Through this period , Sillars grew influence in the party , developing a clear socio-economic platform including Independence in Europe , reversing the SNPs previous opposition to membership of the then-EEC which had been unsuccessful in a 1975 referendum . This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming Glasgow Govan in a by-election in 1988 .",
      "Despite this moderation , the party did not join Labour , the Liberal Democrats and the Greens as well as civil society in the Scottish Constitutional Convention which developed a blueprint for a devolved Scottish Parliament due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option .",
      "First Salmond era ( 1990s ) .",
      "Alex Salmond had been elected MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987 , after the re-admittance of 79 Group members , and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilsons resignation in 1990 after a contest with Margaret Ewing . This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment , including Sillars and then-Party Secretary John Swinney . The defection of Labour MP Dick Douglas further evidenced the partys clear left-wing positioning , particularly regarding opposition to the poll tax . Despite this , Salmonds leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in 1992 with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs .",
      "The mid-90s offered some successes for the party , with North East Scotland being gained at the 1994 European elections and the party securing a by-election at Perth and Kinross in 1995 after a near-miss at Monklands East the previous year .",
      "1997 offered the partys most successful general election for 23 years , although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election . That September , the party joined with the members of the Scottish Constitutional Convention in the successful Yes-Yes campaign in the devolution referendum which lead to the establishment of a Scottish Parliament with tax-varying powers .",
      "By 1999 , the first elections to the parliament were being held , although the party suffered a disappointing result , gaining just 35 MSPs in the face of Salmonds unpopular Kosovo Broadcast which opposed NATO intervention in the country .",
      "Opposing Labour-Liberal Democrat coalitions ( 1999\u20132007 ) .",
      "This meant that the party began as the official opposition in the parliament to a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government . Salmond found the move to a more consensual politics difficult and sought a return to Westminster , resigning the leadership in 2000 with John Swinney , like Salmond a gradualist , victorious in the ensuring leadership election . Swinneys leadership proved ineffectual , with a loss of one MP in 2001 and a further reduction to 27 MSPs in 2003 despite the Officegate scandal unseating previous First Minister Henry McLeish . However , the only parties to gain seats in that election were the Scottish Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party ( SSP ) which like the SNP support independence .",
      "After an unsuccessful leadership challenge in 2003 , Swinney stepped down following disappointing results in the European elections of 2004 with Salmond victorious in the subsequent leadership contest despite initially refusing to be candidate . Nicola Sturgeon was elected Depute Leader and became the partys leader in the Scottish Parliament until Salmond was able to return at the next parliamentary election .",
      "Salmond governments ( 2007\u20132014 ) .",
      "In 2007 , the SNP emerged as the largest party in the Scottish Parliament with 47 of 129 seats , narrowly ousting the Scottish Labour Party with 46 seats and Alex Salmond becoming First Minister after ousting the Liberal Democrats in Gordon . The Scottish Green Party supported Salmonds election as First Minister , and his subsequent appointments of ministers , in return for early tabling of the climate change bill and the SNP nominating a Green MSP to chair a parliamentary committee . Despite this , Salmonds minority government tended to strike budget deals with the Conservatives to stay in office .",
      "In May 2011 , the SNP won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament with 69 seats . This was a significant feat as the additional member system used for Scottish Parliament elections was specifically designed to prevent one party from winning an outright majority . This was followed by a reverse in the partys previous opposition to NATO membership at the partys annual conference in 2012 despite Salmonds refusal to apologise for the Kosovo broadcast on the occasion of the Kosovo Declaration of Independence .",
      "This majority enabled the SNP government to hold a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 . The No vote prevailed in a close-fought campaign , prompting the resignation of First Minister Alex Salmond . Forty-five percent of Scottish voters cast their ballots for independence , with the Yes side receiving less support than late polling predicted . This was suggested as due to Salmonds unpopularity among women and Nicola Sturgeon won that years leadership election unopposed .",
      "Sturgeon years ( 2014 onwards ) .",
      "The SNP rebounded from the loss in the independence referendum at the 2015 UK general election , led by Nicola Sturgeon . The party went from holding six seats in the House of Commons to 56 , mostly at the expense of the Labour Party . All but three of the fifty-nine constituencies in the country elected an SNP candidate in the partys most comprehensive electoral victory at any level .",
      "At the 2016 Scottish election , the SNP lost a net total of 6 seats , losing its overall majority in the Scottish Parliament , but returning for a third consecutive term as a minority government despite gaining an additional 1.1% of the constituency vote , for the partys best-ever result , from the 2011 election however 2.3% of the regional list vote . On the constituency vote , the SNP gained 11 seats from Labour , but lost the Edinburgh Southern constituency to the party . The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats each gained two constituency seats from the SNP on 2011 ( Aberdeenshire West and Edinburgh Central for the Conservatives and Edinburgh Western and North East Fife for the Liberal Democrats ) .",
      "This election was followed by the 2016 European Union referendum after which the SNP joined with the Liberal Democrats and Greens to call for continued membership of the EU . Despite a consequential increase in the Conservative vote at the 2017 local elections the SNP for the first time became the largest party in each of Scotlands four city councils : Aberdeen , Dundee , Edinburgh and Glasgow , where a Labour administration was ousted after 37 years .",
      "At the 2017 UK general election the SNP underperformed compared to polling expectations , losing 21 seats to bring their number of Westminster MPs down to 35 \u2013 however this was still the partys second best result ever at the time . This was largely attributed by many , including former Deputy First Minister John Swinney , to their stance on holding a second Scottish independence referendum and saw a swing to the Unionist parties , with seats being picked up by the Conservatives , Labour and the Liberal Democrats and a reduction in their majorities in the other seats . Stephen Gethins , MP for North East Fife , came out of this election with a majority of just 2 to the Liberal Democrat candidate . High-profile losses included SNP Commons leader Angus Robertson in Moray and former party leader and First Minister Alex Salmond in Gordon .",
      "The SNP went on to achieve its best-ever European Parliament result in the final election before Brexit , the party taking its MEP total to 3 or half of Scottish seats and achieving a record vote share for the party . This was also the best performance of any party in the era of proportional elections to the European Parliament in Scotland . This was suggested as being due to the partys europhile sentiment during what amounted to a single-issue election , with parties that lacked a clear message performing poorly , such as Labour finishing in 5th place and losing all of their Scottish MEPs for the first time .",
      "Later that year the SNP experienced a surge in the 2019 general election , winning 45.0% of the vote and 48 seats , its second-best result ever . Although the party suffered a loss to the Liberal Democrats , it gained the seat of its then UK leader Jo Swinson , along with 7 from the Conservatives and 6 from Labour . This victory was generally attributed to Sturgeons cautious approach regarding holding a second independence referendum and a strong emphasis on EU membership during the election . The following January , the UK-wide Conservative majority ensured that the UK left the EU .",
      "At the 2021 Scottish election , the SNP won 64 seats , one seat short of a majority , and leading to another minority government led by the SNP . Sturgeon emphasized after her partys win that it would focus on controlling the COVID-19 pandemic as well as pushing for a second referendum on independence .",
      "Constitution and structure .",
      "The local Branches are the primary level of organisation in the SNP . All of the Branches within each Scottish Parliament constituency form a Constituency Association , which coordinates the work of the Branches within the constituency , coordinates the activities of the party in the constituency and acts as a point of liaison between an MSP or MP and the party . Constituency Associations are composed of delegates from all of the Branches within the constituency .",
      "The annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee . The National Conference is composed of :",
      "- delegates from every Branch and Constituency Association",
      "- the members of the National Executive Committee",
      "- every SNP MSP and MP",
      "- all SNP councillors",
      "- delegates from each of the SNPs Affiliated Organisations ( Young Scots for Independence , SNP Students , SNP Trade Union Group , the Association of Nationalist Councillors , the Disabled Members Group , the SNP BAME Network , Scots Asians for Independence , and Out for Independence )",
      "There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly , which provides a forum for detailed discussions of party policy by party members .",
      "Membership .",
      "Since 18 September 2014 ( the day of the Scottish independence referendum ) , party membership more than quadrupled ( from around 25,000 ) , surpassing the Liberal Democrats to become the third-largest of any political party in the United Kingdom . As of December 2018 , the Party had 125,482 members .",
      "European affiliation .",
      "The SNP retains close links with Plaid Cymru , its counterpart in Wales . MPs from both parties co-operate closely with each other and work as a single parliamentary group within the House of Commons . Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru are members of the European Free Alliance ( EFA ) , a European political party comprising regionalist political parties . The EFA co-operates with the larger European Green Party to form The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance ( Greens/EFA ) group in the European Parliament .",
      "Before its affiliation with The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance , the SNP had previously been allied with the European Progressive Democrats ( 1979\u20131984 ) , Rainbow Group ( 1989\u20131994 ) and European Radical Alliance ( 1994\u20131999 ) .",
      "As the UK is no longer a member of the EU , the SNP has no MEPs .",
      "Policies .",
      "Ideological foundations .",
      "The Scottish National Party did not have a clear ideological position until the 1970s , when it sought to explicitly present itself as a social democratic party in terms of party policy and publicity . During the period from its foundation until the 1960s , the SNP was essentially a moderate centrist party . Debate within the party focused more on the SNP being distinct as an all-Scotland national movement , with it being neither of the left nor the right , but constituting a new politics that sought to put Scotland first .",
      "The SNP was formed through the merger of the centre-left National Party of Scotland ( NPS ) and the centre-right Scottish Party . The SNPs founders were united over self-determination in principle , though not its exact nature , or the best strategic means to achieve self-government . From the mid-1940s onwards , SNP policy was radical and redistributionist concerning land and in favour of the diffusion of economic power , including the decentralisation of industries such as coal to include the involvement of local authorities and regional planning bodies to control industrial structure and development . Party policies supported the economic and social policy status quo of the post-war welfare state .",
      "By the 1960s , the SNP was starting to become defined ideologically , with a social democratic tradition emerging as the party grew in urban , industrial Scotland , and its membership experienced an influx of social democrats from the Labour Party , the trade unions and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . The emergence of Billy Wolfe as a leading figure in the SNP also contributed to the leftwards shift . By this period , the Labour Party was also the dominant party in Scotland , in terms of electoral support and representation . Targeting Labour through emphasising left-of-centre policies and values was therefore electorally logical for the SNP , as well as tying in with the ideological preferences of many new party members . In 1961 , the SNP conference expressed the partys opposition to the siting of the US Polaris submarine base at the Holy Loch . This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to nuclear weapons : a policy that has remained in place ever since . The 1964 policy document , SNP & You , contained a clear centre-left policy platform , including commitments to full employment , government intervention in fuel , power and transport , a state bank to guide economic development , encouragement of cooperatives and credit unions , extensive building of council houses ( social housing ) by central and local government , pensions adjusted to cost of living , a minimum wage and an improved national health service .",
      "The 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNPs efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland , with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group , and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns , such as the Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish Daily Express to run as a co-operative . For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections , the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party , and proposed a range of social democratic policies . There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the Scottish National Party ( Social Democrats ) . In the UK-wide referendum on Britains membership of the European Economic Community ( EEC ) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change , the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC .",
      "There were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979 , with the 79 Group attempting to move the SNP further to the left , away from being what could be described a social-democratic party , to an expressly socialist party . Members of the 79 Group \u2013 including future party leader and First Minister Alex Salmond \u2013 were expelled from the party . This produced a response in the shape of the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland from those who wanted the SNP to remain a broad church , apart from arguments of left vs . right . The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left , such as campaigning against the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland in 1989 ; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK .",
      "Ideological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called SNP gradualists and SNP fundamentalists . In essence , gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution , in a step-by-step strategy . They tend to be in the moderate left grouping , though much of the 79 Group was gradualist in approach . However , this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day , many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position .",
      "Economic policies .",
      "The Sturgeon Government in 2017 adjusted income tax rates so that low earners would pay less and those earning more than \u00a333,000 a year would pay more . Previously the party had replaced the flat rate Stamp Duty with the LBTT , which uses a graduated tax rate . Whilst in government , the party was also responsible for the establishment of Revenue Scotland to administer devolved taxation .",
      "Having previously defined itself in opposition to the poll tax the SNP has also championed progressive taxation at a local level . Despite pledging to introduce a local income tax the Salmond Government found itself unable to replace the council tax and the party has , particularly since the ending of the council tax freeze under Nicola Sturgeons leadership , committing to increasing the graduated nature of the tax . Conversely , the party has also supported capping and reducing Business Rates in an attempt to support small businesses .",
      "It has been noted that the party contains a broader spectrum of opinion regarding economic policy than most political parties in the UK due to its status as the only viable vehicle for Scottish independence , with the partys parliamentary group at Westminster in 2016 including socialists such as Tommy Sheppard and Mhairi Black , capitalists such as Stewart Hosie and former Conservative , Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh .",
      "Social policies .",
      "Under Sturgeons leadership , Scotland was twice in succession named the best country in Europe for LGBTI legal equality . Party policy aims to introduce gender self-identification to allow an easier process of gender recognition for transgender community . This is in stark contrast to Scotlands recent history as a deeply socially conservative country although this transformation can be seen to have taken place in the countrys other main political parties largely simultaneously .",
      "Particularly since Nicola Sturgeons elevation to First Minister the party has highlighted its commitments to gender equality \u2013 with her first act being to appoint a gender balanced cabinet . The SNP have also taken steps to implement all-women shortlists whilst Sturgeon has introduced a mentoring scheme to encourage womens political engagement .",
      "The SNP supports multiculturalism with Scotland receiving thousands of refugees from the Syrian Civil War . To this end it has been claimed that refugees in Scotland are better supported than those in England . More generally , the SNP seeks to increase immigration to combat a declining population and calling for a separate Scottish visa even within the UK .",
      "Foreign and defence policies .",
      "Despite traditionally supporting military neutrality the SNPs policy has in recent years moved to support both the Atlanticist and Europeanist traditions . This is particularly evident in the conclusion of the NATO debate within the party in favour of those who support membership of the military alliance . This is despite the partys continuing opposition to Scotland hosting nuclear weapons and then-leader Salmonds criticism of both the Kosovo intervention and the Iraq War . The party has placed an emphasis on developing positive relations with the United States in recent years despite a lukewarm reaction to the election of Scottish American Donald Trump as President due to long running legal disputes .",
      "Having opposed membership in the 1975 referendum , the party has supported membership of the European Union since the adoption of the Independence in Europe policy during the 1980s . Consequentially , the SNP supported remaining within the EU during the 2016 referendum where every Scottish council area backed this position . Consequently , the party opposed Brexit and sought a further referendum on the withdrawal agreement , ultimately unsuccessfully . The SNP would like to see an independent Scotland as a member of the European Union and NATO and has left open the prospect of an independent Scotland joining the Euro .",
      "The SNP has also taken a stance against Russian interference abroad \u2013 the party supporting the enlargement of the EU and NATO to areas such as the Western Balkans and Ukraine to counter this influence . The party called for repercussions for Russia regarding the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal and has criticised former leader Alex Salmond for broadcasting a chat show on Kremlin-backed network RT . Consequently , party representatives have expressed support for movements such as Euromaidan that support the independence of countries across Eastern Europe .",
      "The party have supported measures including foreign aid which seek to facilitate international development through various charitable organisations . In recognition of Scotlands historic links to the country , these programmes are mostly focused in Malawi in common with previous Scottish governments . With local authorities across the country , including Glasgow City Council being involved in this partnership since before the SNP took office in 2007 .",
      "Health and education policies .",
      "The SNP have pledged to uphold the public service nature of NHS Scotland and are consequently opposed to any attempts at privatisation of the health service , including any inclusion in a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States . The party has been fond of increasing provision under the NHS with the introduction of universal baby boxes based on the Finnish scheme . This supported child development alongside other commitments including the expansion of free childcare for children younger than school age and the introduction of universal free school meals in the first three years of school .",
      "Previously , SNP governments have abolished hospital parking charges as well as prescription charges in efforts to promote enhanced public health outcomes by increasing access to care and treatment . Furthermore , during Sturgeons premiership , Scotland became the first country in the world to introduce alcohol minimum unit pricing to counter alcohol problems . Recently , the party has also committed to providing universal access to sanitary products and the liberalisation of drugs policy through devolution , in an effort to increase access to treatment and improve public health outcomes .",
      "The party also promotes universal access to education , with one of the first acts of the Salmond government being to abolish tuition fees . More recently , the party has turned its attention to widening access to higher education with Nicola Sturgeon stating that education is her number one priority . At school level , the Curriculum for Excellence is currently undergoing a review .",
      "Constitution policies .",
      "The foundations of the SNP are a belief that Scotland would be more prosperous by being governed independently from the United Kingdom , although the party was defeated in the 2014 referendum on this issue . The party has since sought to hold a second referendum at some point in the future , perhaps related to the outcome of Brexit , as the party sees a referendum as the only route to independence . The party is constitutionalist and as such rejects holding such a referendum unilaterally or any course of actions that could lead to comparisons with cases such as Catalonia with the party seeing independence as a process that should be undertaken through a consensual process alongside the UK Government . As part of this process towards independence , the party supports increased devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government , particularly in areas such as welfare and immigration .",
      "Official SNP policy is supportive of the monarchy however members are divided on the issue . The party does propose reducing the funds spent on the royal family . Separately , the SNP has always opposed the UKs unelected upper house and would like to see both it and the House of Commons elected by a form of proportional representation . The party also supports the introduction of a written constitution , either for an independent Scotland or the UK as a whole , going as far as producing a proposed interim constitution for Scotland during the independence referendum campaign .",
      "Fundamentalists and gradualists .",
      "With how to achieve independence , the party was traditionally split between fundamentalists and gradualists .",
      "The SNP leadership generally subscribe to the gradualist viewpoint , that being the idea that Scottish independence can be won by the accumulation by the Scottish Parliament of powers that the UK Parliament currently has over time .",
      "Fundamentalism stands in opposition to the so-called gradualist point of view , which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely to achieve it . The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness .",

      "Adolf Cornelius Piening ( 16 September 1910 \u2013 15 May 1984 ) was a Kapit\u00e4nleutnant with the Kriegsmarine during World War II . He commanded the Type IXC U-boat , sinking twenty-six ships on nine patrols , for a total of of Allied shipping , to become the nineteenth highest scoring U-Boat ace of World War II , and receiving the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross . The Knights Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership .",
      "Career .",
      "Piening joined the Reichsmarine in 1930 . His first assignment was to the armoured cruiser , after which he served on torpedo boats and minesweepers , reaching the rank of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant by April 1939 . In October 1940 he moved from the surface fleet to the U-boat arm ( U-Bootwaffe ) .",
      "In May\u2013June 1941 he carried out a single patrol out of Saint-Nazaire aboard ( commanded by Herbert Schultze ) as Kommandantensch\u00fcler or Commander-in-Training . Following this , he was appointed commander of the newly built Type IX submarine on 23 August 1941 . After training the boats crew for several month , Piening set out from Kiel on his first patrol in command of U-155 in February 1942 , with the intention of attacking shipping in American waters . On the journey across the Atlantic , U-155 encountered the westbound convoy ON 67 , and after sending out a contact report that allowed several more U-boats to be directed against the convoy , carried out an attack that sank an 8,000 ton tanker and a 1,800 ton freighter . U-155 sank another ship off the coast of the United States re-crossing the Atlantic to the submarines new base at Lorient , as part of the 10th U-boat Flotilla .",
      "Piening carried out a further seven patrols in command of U-155 , sinking 26 ships for a total of , including the escort carrier , and also badly damaged the attack cargo ship . He also became well known for developing the Piening Route in 1943 , hugging the coast of France and northern Spain , to evade Allied patrol aircraft in the Bay of Biscay .

      "History .",
      "The name Ouagadougou dates back to the 15th century when the Ninsi tribes inhabited the area . They were in constant conflict until 1441 when Wubri , a Yonyonse hero and an important figure in Burkina Fasos history , led his tribe to victory . He then renamed the area from Kumbee-Tenga , as the Ninsi had called it , to Wage sabre soba koumbem tenga , meaning head war chiefs village . Ouagadougou is a Francophone spelling of the name .",
      "The city became the capital of the Mossi Empire in 1441 and became the permanent residence of the Mossi emperors ( Moro-Naba ) in 1681 . The Moro-Naba Ceremony is still performed every Friday by the Moro-Naba and his court .

      "Jon Gruden",
      "Jon David Gruden ( born August 17 , 1963 ) is an American football coach who is the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League ( NFL ) . He first served as the Raiders head coach from 1998 to 2001 during their tenure in Oakland and rejoined the team in 2018 . In between his tenure with the Raiders , he was the head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2002 to 2008 , whom he led to their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVII . At age 39 , Gruden was the then-youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl . Gruden also served as an analyst for ESPN and Monday Night Football before he returned to coaching .",
      "Early life .",
      "Gruden was born on August 17 , 1963 , in Sandusky , Ohio into a family of Slovene descent . His father , Jim , later served as a professional football regional scout , quarterbacks coach , and director of player personnel for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . His brother , Jay , played and coached in the Arena Football League for the Tampa Bay Storm and Orlando Predators , and was most recently the head coach of the Washington Redskins . His other brother , James , is a radiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine .",
      "Gruden was raised Roman Catholic , and was a Cleveland Browns fan growing up . At the age of 15 , he attended Clay High School in South Bend , Indiana , home to the University of Notre Dame , where his father served as an assistant to head coach Dan Devine . After graduating in 1982 , Gruden attended Muskingum College in New Concord , Ohio . After one year , he transferred to the University of Dayton . At Dayton , he was a three-year letterman and backup quarterback for the Flyers under coach Mike Kelly . Gruden never saw much playing time , but the Flyers posted a 24\u20137 record during his three seasons at the University of Dayton . He graduated with a degree in communications in 1986 .",
      "Coaching career .",
      "College coaching .",
      "After graduating from the University of Dayton , Gruden was hired as a graduate assistant coach at the University of Tennessee during the 1985\u20131986 season . After his time with the Volunteers , he spent two years after that as the quarterbacks coach at Southeast Missouri State . Gruden then moved to the University of the Pacific in 1989 as offensive assistant as the tight ends coach . Walt Harris was the offensive coordinator at Tennessee , where Gruden was one of his graduate assistant coaches , and later hired him at Pacific . In 1990 , Gruden was a special assistant with the San Francisco 49ers under quarterbacks coach Mike Holmgren . In March 1991 , Gruden became the wide receivers coach for the University of Pittsburgh under head coach Paul Hackett .",
      "Professional coaching .",
      "In January 1992 , at the age of 28 , Gruden was hired by Mike Holmgren , his former boss at the San Francisco 49ers , to be the special offensive assistant/wide receivers coach with the Green Bay Packers . After three seasons in Green Bay , Gruden became the offensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles under former Packers assistant coach Ray Rhodes . Gruden then was chosen by the owner and general manager of the Oakland Raiders , Al Davis , to be the Raiders new head coach for the 1998 season .",
      "Oakland Raiders .",
      "Under Gruden , the Raiders posted consecutive 8\u20138 seasons in 1998 and 1999 , and leapt out of last place in the AFC West . After uniting with journeyman quarterback Rich Gannon , Gruden led the Raiders to the top of the AFC West and they made the playoffs in three consecutive seasons from 2000 to 2002 ( the third season was under head coach Bill Callahan ) . Oakland finished 12\u20134 in the 2000 season , the teams most successful season in a decade , and its first division title since 1990 , ultimately reaching the , where they lost , 16\u20133 , to the eventual Super Bowl champions Baltimore Ravens . In 2001 , the Raiders would return to the postseason with a 10\u20136 record , but in the AFC Divisional Round a negated fumble proved costly as they were defeated , 16\u201313 , in overtime by the eventual Super Bowl champions New England Patriots . While Gruden was with the Raiders , Gruden acquired his nickname Chucky from Raiders defensive lineman Grady Jackson , who thought that the coach looked like the fictional character Chucky in the 1988 slasher movie Childs Play .",
      "Tampa Bay Buccaneers .",
      "After compiling a 40\u201328 win-loss record ( including playoffs ) in four seasons with the Raiders , Gruden replaced the fired Tony Dungy as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002 , via a high-stakes trade that included Tampa Bays 2002 and 2003 first-round draft picks , 2002 and 2004 second-round draft picks , and $8 million in cash . The trade took place for a number of reasons , including Daviss desire for a more vertical passing attack rather than Grudens horizontal pass attack , the fact that Grudens contract would expire a year after the trade , and Daviss uncertainty over whether Gruden was worth as much money as his next contract was sure to pay him . Gruden signed a five-year contract with the Buccaneers worth $17.5 million .",
      "The Buccaneers search for a head coach had taken more than two months , and Tampa Bay had expressed an interest in Gruden , but Davis had originally refused to release him from his contract . The team subsequently interviewed several other coaches and believed a deal was in place with Bill Parcells , before Parcells backed out , reportedly because his choice for General Manager , Mike Tannenbaum , told him not to accept the job because of the salary cap difficulties that Tampa Bay was about to endure . With the franchises search floundering , the fact that the coach who the Buccaneers wanted had only one year remaining on his deal , and the immediate hire of Dungy by the Indianapolis Colts , many fans and sports commentators began to openly question if the Buccaneers had made the right move by dismissing Dungy . Only a big splash hire could quiet the storm , and this may have been the primary motivation for the Buccaneers to give up as much as they did to acquire Gruden .",
      "Immediately after arriving in Tampa Bay , Gruden significantly retooled the offense with the addition of numerous free agents . His determination to fix the under-performing offense , so often maligned during Dungys tenure , inspired Tampas defense to another #1 ranking , which helped the team to a 12\u20134 season . Both the offense and defense hit their stride in the playoffs ; the Buccaneers posted a playoff per-game point differential of 23 points per game in victory , tied with the 1992 Dallas Cowboys for the highest average playoff margin of victory by a Super Bowl winner in the free agency era . Fans were especially satisfied with a victory in the against the Philadelphia Eagles , the team that had defeated Tampa Bay in the Wild Card round two years running by the combined score of 52\u201312 , and Gruden was especially satisfied with a dominant win over his old team , the Raiders , in Super Bowl XXXVII . Despite the Super Bowl win , there were many who attributed Grudens win primarily to the defense that coach Tony Dungy and defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin had created during Dungys tenure with the Buccaneers . Gruden , for his part , publicly and graciously thanked Dungy for his contributions upon accepting the Lombardi Trophy at the Super Bowl XXXVII postgame ceremony .",
      "The victory made Gruden the youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl at age 39 . This record would be surpassed in Super Bowl XLIII by Mike Tomlin , who previously served under Gruden as the Buccaneers defensive backs coach .",
      "Grudens mantra for the 2002 season was Pound the Rock , a reference to commitment to the running game . Gruden even went as far as to display a large chunk of granite in the locker room , a tactic mimicked by the Jacksonville Jaguars . ( The Jaguars slogan , Keep choppin wood , was tainted though when punter Chris Hanson injured his leg on an axe brought in to accompany a large log. ) Upon returning to Tampa after winning Super Bowl XXXVII , he led a capacity crowd at Raymond James Stadium in chanting the phrase . However , it seemingly disappeared from the lexicon the following year , and was not aggressively marketed or displayed on stadium video boards .",
      "Unable to afford replacements , the following season saw the team decimated by injuries to many of the Super Bowl stars , including Joe Jurevicius , Greg Spires , Shelton Quarles , and Brian Kelly , as well as acrimony with highly paid veterans such as Sapp and wide receivers Keyshawn Johnson and Keenan McCardell . The Buccaneers finished 7\u20139 in 2003 and 5\u201311 in 2004 to become the first team to have consecutive losing seasons after winning the Super Bowl . A particular low point during this period occurred in a Monday Night Football home matchup against the Indianapolis Colts , led by Grudens predecessor Dungy . The Buccaneers dominated much of the game , allowing them to take a 35\u201314 lead near the end of the fourth quarter , but were overcome by a Colts rally that resulted in them losing 38\u201335 .",
      "When former Raiders general manager Bruce Allen joined the Buccaneers in 2004 , Gruden finally had the general manager\u2013head coach partnership he desired , and while the salary cap continued to plague the team ( which spent the least money in the league between 2004 and 2009 ) their 2004 and 2005 drafts yielded a few impact players , including 2005 Offensive NFL Rookie of the Year Award winner Carnell Cadillac Williams .",
      "Also , 2005 marked a return to the playoffs , as the Buccaneers posted a surprising 11\u20135 record , despite the loss of starting quarterback Brian Griese and some controversial coaching decisions , including a two-point conversion in the final seconds to defeat the Washington Redskins , who would later return to Tampa Bay and eliminate the Buccaneers from the wild-card round of the playoffs .",
      "In 2006 , Gruden led the Buccaneers to a dismal 4\u201312 season , which was his worst record as a head coach . The 2006 season was the first time a Tampa Bay team had not won more than four games since 1991 .",
      "In an interview with Ira Kaufman of The Tampa Tribune on March 28 , 2007 , Buccaneers executive vice president Joel Glazer discussed the state of the Buccaneers . During the interview , Joel Glazer defended Grudens performance , citing lost draft picks , injuries , and salary cap issues . However , he also said Mediocrity will never be standard for the Buccaneers , but we have to move on .",
      "In 2007 , the team finally cleared itself of salary cap constraints and united Gruden with a mobile West Coast quarterback in former Pro Bowler and Grey Cup winner Jeff Garcia . The Buccaneers returned to the playoffs in 2007 with a 9\u20137 record , including five divisional wins ( after resting starters for the final two games ) . This despite suffering major injuries , several season-ending , to critical players like Luke Petitgout , Carnell Williams , Mike Alstott , Alex Smith , Brian Kelly , Barrett Ruud , Michael Clayton , Patrick Chukwurah , Gaines Adams , and starting kick and punt returner Mark Jones . Despite this adversity , however , Gruden declared The future is so bright around here I have to wear shades .",
      "In 2008 , Gruden was rewarded with a contract extension through the 2011 season . On November 30 , Gruden earned his 100th career victory , which came against the New Orleans Saints . Going into December , the Buccaneers were on pace to make the playoffs , claim a bye week and have home field advantage . However , the Buccaneers went winless in the month of December , in no small part due to a defensive collapse that saw the team give up an average of 30.75 points per game . On December 28 , the Buccaneers were eliminated from making the playoffs by the Oakland Raiders , the team Gruden left for Tampa Bay . The Buccaneers ended the season with four losses in a row , and Gruden was fired by the Buccaneers on January 16 , 2009 , after seven seasons with the team .",
      "Post\u2013Tampa Bay career .",
      "In May 2010 , Gruden became a volunteer assistant offensive line coach at Carrollwood Day School in Tampa , Florida . Shortly after being fired from Tampa Bay , Gruden created the Fired Football Coaches Association . The organization ( a football think-tank ) had its headquarters in a rented office in a Tampa strip mall . The FFCA was known to have a large amount of game and player film collected by Gruden as well as playbooks and Gruden was known to have game plans of his own that he kept updated over the years he was not actively coaching . Many coaches such as Chip Kelly , Urban Meyer , Jim Haslett , Rick Venturi , Sean McVay , Greg Schiano and Monte Kiffin and many players came to the facility to watch film and talk with Gruden . Gruden closed the FFCA upon his returning to coaching in 2018 moving the game and player film along with the other information he held there to Oakland .",
      "Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders ( second stint ) .",
      "After nine years away from coaching in the NFL , the Raiders announced the return of Gruden as head coach on January 6 , 2018 . Gruden signed a 10-year , $100 million contract , one of the biggest contracts in the history of the league which also includes a no-trade clause , closing the loophole that saw the Raiders trade him to the Buccaneers in return for draft picks and cash . Gruden came back to coaching after six years of attempts by Raiders owner Mark Davis to lure him back to be the Raiders head coach . Gruden said that he came back due to his need to go compete I got tired of sitting in a dark room , watching tape by myself , Gruden says . I took rumba-dancing classes ; that didn\u2019t last\u2014I wasn\u2019t any good . Bought a boat ; I never used it . Live on a golf course ; I never play . I\u2019d go to the FFCA early , and next thing I know it\u2019s 10:30 at night . I\u2019m thinking , S--- . I\u2019m wasting my time . I got to go compete . Some of his first few moves included signing several veterans , drafting Kolton Miller in the first round of the 2018 draft and trading away Khalil Mack for 2019 and 2020 first-round draft picks , and later trading Amari Cooper for the Dallas Cowboys first-round draft pick . The team would go 4\u201312 in his first year back with the team . The following year , due to a strong rookie class showing , Gruden led the Raiders to a 6\u20134 record . However , after many crucial players suffering injuries , the Raiders would end their last season in Oakland 1-5 and 7-9 overall .",
      "Gruden was fined by the NFL for not properly wearing a face mask , as required for coaches during the COVID-19 pandemic , during a week 2 game in the 2020 NFL season on September 22 , 2020 . He was fined an additional for further COVID-19 protocol violations on November 5 , 2020 .",
      "Broadcasting career .",
      "In May 2009 , Gruden was hired by ESPN to serve as a color analyst on its Monday Night Football telecasts , replacing Tony Kornheiser . He also served as an analyst for ESPNs coverage of the NFL Draft and postseason college football games , helping to call the 2010 Rose Bowl and 2010 BCS National Championship Game on ESPN Radio and the 2011 Outback Bowl and 2011 Orange Bowl on ESPN . In the spring of 2012 , Gruden became the focus of the series Jon Grudens QB Camp , where he went over the NFL development process with prospective NFL Draftees at quarterback , including Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III in which he occasionally has talks about what he believes to be the best play in football ( a play-action pass called Spider 2 Y-Banana , in which the fullback runs a flat route and is the primary target ) . During the Monday Night Football broadcast , Gruden gave out a weekly award called the Gruden Grinder to the best player in the game that week .",
      "Gruden signed a contract extension with ESPN , beginning in September 2012 , that lengthened his tenure with the broadcasting company for another five years . On December 15 , 2014 , Gruden and ESPN agreed to a contract extension through 2021 but allowed an out in the event he wanted to return to coaching . The deal made Gruden the highest paid personality at ESPN . After deciding to return to the coaching ranks with the Raiders for the 2018 NFL season , his last game for ESPN was the 2017 AFC Wild Card game between the Tennessee Titans and the Kansas City Chiefs .",

      "During a road game against the Carolina Panthers in the first week of the 2020 NFL season , Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr yelled out Cindy Gruden in an audible , as he approached the line of scrimmage . Jon Gruden later said he was perplexed as to the reason behind the choice of words and he joked that Carr better keep my wife out of it from now on . The play resulted in a one-yard gain by Raiders running back Josh Jacobs , with the team scoring a touchdown on that drive and eventually winning the game , their first since moving from Oakland during the offseason .",

      "The Vindobona is an international named passenger train which began service in 1957 between Berlin and Vienna via Dresden and Prague . In later years the route was extended to run from Hamburg via Berlin , Dresden , Prague , Brno and Vienna to Villach . It was named after the ancient settlement of Vindobona on the site of the modern city of Vienna . Labelled as a EuroCity train connection from 1993 , services discontinued in 2014 .",
      "Since December 2018 there is a daily direct Intercity-Express high-speed train between Vienna and Berlin via Linz , Passau and Erfurt . The name Vindobona is now used for Railjet trains between Prague and Graz via Vienna operated by \u010cesk\u00e9 dr\u00e1hy and Austrian Federal Railways ( \u00d6BB ) . This route has been again extended to Berlin from mid-2020 .",
      "Route .",
      "The service began on 13 January 1957 using diesel multiple units classified as Fernschnellzug ( FDt 50/51 ) running from Friedrichstra\u00dfe station in East Berlin via Berlin Ostbahnhof , Elsterwerda , Dresden Hauptbahnhof , Prague hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed and \u010cesk\u00e9 Velenice/Gm\u00fcnd to Wien Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof . The FDt trains had already begun running between Berlin and Prague in December 1950 , including a through coach connection to Vienna . In 1959 the connection was upgraded as Expresszug ( Ext 54/55 ) .",
      "From December 1957 the railcars had first and second class sections . The participating companies Deutsche Reichsbahn ( DR ) , \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e9 st\u00e1tn\u00ed dr\u00e1hy ( \u010cSD ) and \u00d6sterreichische Bundesbahnen ( \u00d6BB ) operated one train pair daily , meeting in Czechoslovakia . The service was used primarily by West Berliners , diplomats and Scandinavians in transit through East Germany , connecting from the night trains from Copenhagen ( Ostsee-Express ) and Stockholm ( Sa\u00dfnitz-Express ) via train ferry from Warnem\u00fcnde and Sassnitz resp. , and shuttle trains from Zoologischer Garten station in West Berlin . In the dining car , passengers could pay using Deutschmark , East German mark , Czechoslovak koruna , and Austrian schilling .",
      "In Czechoslovakia trains originally ran on the historic Emperor Franz Joseph Railway line via T\u00e1bor to the border with Austria at \u010cesk\u00e9 Velenice , later rerouted via the first Czech railway corridor to Brno and B\u0159eclav . In the period of Normalization from 1969 onwards , domestic travel within Czechoslovakia was for some years completely forbidden , occasionally restricted to journeys between D\u011b\u010d\u00edn and T\u00e1bor . The original journey via T\u00e1bor took over 12 hours to complete from Berlin to Vienna . Later , the mainline via Brno became faster , and the train was rerouted , initially via Havl\u00ed\u010dk\u016fv Brod and later via Pardubice and \u010cesk\u00e1 T\u0159ebov\u00e1 along the Czech international corridor , shortening the journey to 9 hours . In 1975 , Wien Mitte station became the terminus due to construction at the Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof .",
      "Rolling stock .",
      "Rolling stock was alternately supplied by the railway companies for a period of two years : The DR used a refurbished pre-war DRG Class SVT 137 unit until 1960 , succeeded by M\u00c1VAG 495.0 and 498.0 railcars operated by \u010cSD , and \u00d6BB 5145 ( Blue Lightning ) DMUs from 1962 to 1964 . In 1966 DR introduced its newly engineered VT 18.16 diesel-hydraulic express railcars , apparently rivalling with the West German DB Class VT 11.5 . Renamed Class 175 in 1970 , these prestigious trainsets became a flagship in the range of DR services . From 1969 to 1972 , \u010cSD operated its recently developed M 296.1 railcars with a top speed of .",
      "The Vindobona trains continued to be operated by DMUs until it became evident that they were no longer able to cope in terms of capacity . In 1979 they were replaced by a composition comprising an electric locomotive coupled with individual carriages . The trains then ran as Durchgangszug ( D 275/276 ) and from 1986 to 1988 services were united with the Hungaria Interexpress train to Bratislava and Budapest , including Hungarian State Railways ( M\u00c1V ) railcars and Yugoslav Railways ( J\u017d ) through coaches to Belgrade . In later years trains were hauled by DB Class 101 , \u010cD Class 371 and Class 380 , and \u00d6BB 1216 ( EuroSprinter ) locomotives .",
      "EuroCity .",
      "After the Revolutions of 1989 and the fall of the Iron Curtain , the railway connection gained new significance . A EuroCity ( EC ) service from Hamburg to Prague was already inaugurated in 1992 and in the following year , the Vindobona train also became categorised as EC 172/173 . The DR operations were taken over by Deutsche Bahn AG by 1994 . With the opening of Berlin Hauptbahnhof on 28 May 2006 , trains passed through Berlin via the new North\u2013South mainline . As of 2010 , trains ran from Villach Hauptbahnhof to Hamburg-Altona via Klagenfurt , Vienna , Brno , Prague , Dresden and Berlin in about 16 hours .",
      "As of 14 December 2014 , the EC 172/173 Vindobona was replaced by the EC 172/173 Porta Bohemica from Hamburg-Altona to Budapest Keleti , connecting in Prague hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed to a Railjet train service via the newly built Wien Hauptbahnhof to Graz Hauptbahnhof and vice versa . Since December 2018 there is a daily direct DB Intercity Express high-speed train ( ICE 92/93 Berolina ) from Berlin to Vienna via Erfurt , Nuremberg and Linz , as well as a \u00d6BB Nightjet train with sleeping car ( NJ 456/457 ) via Wroc\u0142aw , Bohum\u00edn and B\u0159eclav . The name Vindobona has then been reused for the Railjet line connecting Prague , Vienna and Graz ( RJ 256/257 ) . After delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic , this route has been extended to Berlin from 14 June 2020 ; thus , the historic train connection is reestablished ."

      "SV Darmstadt 98",
      "Sportverein Darmstadt 1898 e.V . is a German football club based in Darmstadt , Hesse . The club was founded on 22 May 1898 as FC Olympia Darmstadt . Early in 1919 , the association was briefly known as Rasen-Sportverein Olympia before merging with Darmst\u00e4dter Sport Club 1905 on 11 November that year to become Sportverein Darmstadt 98 . Merger partner SC was the product of a 1905 union between Viktoria 1900 Darmstadt and Germania 1903 Darmstadt . The footballers are today part of a sports club which also offers its approximately 7,600 members basketball , hiking , futsal , judo , and table tennis .",
      "The football department competed in the Bundesliga for the 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317 seasons after a 33-year run in lower leagues .",
      "History .",
      "Early history .",
      "Olympia played as a lower table side in the Westkreisliga between 1909 and 1913 . In the late 20s and early 30s the club played as SV Darmstadt in the Kreisliga Odenwald and Bezirksliga Main-Hessen , Gruppe Hesse , but struggled to stay in top flight competition . In 1933 , German football was reorganized under the Third Reich into sixteen premier divisions known as Gauligen . Darmstadt was not able to break into upper league play until 1941 when they joined the Gauliga Hessen-Nassau , Gruppe 2 . Their stay was short-lived and they were relegated after their second season of play at that level . By 1944\u201345 the division had collapsed in the face of the advance of Allied armies into Germany .",
      "Darmstadt enjoyed a long run as a second division team through the 50s and then again from the time of the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963 on into the 70s . However , they were never better than a lower to mid-table side until they finally managed a breakthrough in 1973 with a Regionalliga S\u00fcd championship and participation in the promotion rounds for the Bundesliga where they finished a distant second to Rot-Weiss Essen .",
      "From the Bundesliga to insolvency .",
      "A side with limited resources , Darmstadt eventually managed two seasons in the Bundesliga ( 1978\u201379 and 1981\u201382 ) . They narrowly missed a third turn in the top league in 1988 when they lost in a lengthy relegation-promotion play-off to Waldhof Mannheim in penalty shoot-out of the third match between the two clubs . In the following years Darmstadt 98 escaped relegation to the Amateur Oberliga Hessen ( III ) in 1991 when Essen was refused a 2 . Bundesliga licence for financial reasons . However , by 1997 , SV had themselves become victims of financial mismanagement , slipping to the third and fourth divisions .",
      "The teams most recent successes include wins in the Hessen Pokal ( Hessen Cup ) in 1999 , 2001 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 as well as three consecutive Possmann-Hessen Cup wins from 2000 to 2002 . In the DFB-Pokal , Darmstadt advanced as far as the third round in 1989 and 2001 , and to the quarter-finals in 1986 . In 2004 , the club claimed the Oberliga Hessen ( IV ) championship under manager and former player Bruno Labbadia and were promoted to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd ( III ) .",
      "Financial problems limited their options and they were relegated to the Oberliga Hessen ( IV ) at the end of the 2006\u201307 season . The clubs stated aim was to reach the new 3 . Liga within five years . However , on 6 March 2008 Darmstadt entered insolvency proceedings with debts of around \u20ac1.1 million making the future of the club uncertain . After the 2007\u201308 Oberliga Hessen Championship , Darmstadt played in the Regionalliga S\u00fcd . Darmstadt took various measures to avert bankruptcy , for example a friendly benefit match against Bayern Munich , donations etc . In addition , the former management of the club ( e.g . former president , former tax advisor ) made vital financial contributions which secured the clubs future .",
      "Rise to the Bundesliga .",
      "After winning the 2010\u201311 Regionalliga S\u00fcd in dramatic fashion , Darmstadt were promoted to the 3 . Liga . In 2012 , Dirk Schuster was appointed as head coach , and he signed Darmstadts future captain , Ayta\u00e7 Sulu . In the 2012\u201313 season , the club was initially relegated but their fiercest rivals Kickers Offenbach were refused a 3 . Liga licence due to going into administration and were relegated to the Regionalliga instead . Darmstadt 98 took Offenbachs place .",
      "In 2013\u201314 , having finished third in league and thus gaining entry into the promotion-relegation play-offs , Darmstadt defeated Arminia Bielefeld in the second leg through away goals after losing 1\u20133 in the first leg at home to secure promotion to 2 . Bundesliga for the first time in 21 years in dramatic circumstances .",
      "In the following 2 . Bundesliga season , Darmstadt secured the second-place position in the league and therefore promotion to the Bundesliga after a 33-year absence . In their final league match , against FC St . Pauli , the club won 1\u20130 at home through a 70th minute free-kick by Tobias Kempe . This was the second consecutive promotion for the team , led again by coach Schuster and captain Sulu .",
      "Darmstadt reached the Round of 16 of the 2015\u201316 DFB Pokal . On 8 March 2016 , long-term fan Jonathan Heimes died of cancer and posthumously , Darmstadts stadium was renamed into Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion am B\u00f6llenfalltor for the 2016\u201317 season . Darmstadt finished the 2015\u201316 season in 14th position , mainly due to a positive away record .",
      "Coach Dirk Schuster announced his decision to join FC Augsburg , whereas Norbert Meier was appointed as head coach for the 2016\u201317 season . After being defeated in the second round of the 2016\u201317 DFB Pokal and only scoring 8 points in 12 games , Maier was sacked on 5 December 2016 . On 27 December 2016 , former Bundesliga player and Werder Bremen assistant manager Torsten Frings was presented as new head coach . However , the team was incapable of securing the next season in the Bundesliga after a 0\u20131 defeat to Bayern Munich in the 32nd matchday of the season , and was relegated to the 2 . Bundesliga .",
      "After a poor start to the 2017/18-second Bundesliga season , Torsten Frings was removed from his position and on 11 December 2017 the vacant managers position was again filled by Dirk Schuster who returned to the Darmstadt club for his second spell as manager , finishing 10th in the league .",
      "In the 2018/19-second Bundesliga season , Dimitrios Grammozis replaced Schuster after 23 points out of 22 games , placed at position 14 of 18 clubs , finishing again at position 10 . In the following season , the club finished at position 5 . After the season , Markus Anfang took over as head coach .",

      "William Duncan ( missionary )",
      "William Duncan ( 3 April 1832 \u2013 30 August 1918 ) was an English-born Anglican missionary who founded the Tsimshian communities of Metlakatla , British Columbia , in Canada , and Metlakatla , Alaska , in the United States . Although sometimes referred to as Father Duncan in subsequent reports , he was never ordained .",
      "Early years .",
      "Duncan was born in the hamlet of Bishop Burton , Yorkshire , England , the illegitimate son of Maria Duncan , a teenaged servant . He was raised by his mothers parents , William and Elizabeth Duncan . In the 1841 census he is recorded as living with his father and his sister Mary Duncan on Lairgate in Beverley . In 1851 he was lodging with William Botterill , a tailor , and Mary Botterill in Keldgate , Beverley and his occupation is described as book-keeper . Duncan later worked in his grandfather/adoptive fathers trade as a tanner . Duncan became the only churchgoer in his impoverished family .",
      "In 1854 he joined the Church Missionary Society ( CMS ) and attended the Church Missionary Society College , Islington .",
      "Arrival in Canada .",
      "In 1856 the CMS sent Duncan to the North Pacific coast of Canada , and in 1857 he arrived at the remote Hudsons Bay Company ( HBC ) fort settlement at Lax Kwalaams , British Columbia , then part of HBCs New Caledonia district and known as Fort Simpson or Port Simpson . He proselytized among the Tsimshians and learned to speak Tsimshian from Arthur Wellington Clah , a Tsimshian lineage head and HBC employee . Clah was to later save Duncans life when the villages leading chief , Paul Legaic , threatened Duncan at gunpoint for ringing churchbells on the day of Legaics daughters initiation into a secret society . Legaic eventually became a key convert of Duncans .",
      "Founding of Metlakatla in British Columbia .",
      "Duncan led initially 60 Tsimshians to found with him a new utopian Christian community , Metlakatla , on Metlakatla Pass near present-day Prince Rupert , at the southern end of the small peninsula on which Lax Kwalaams sits . By the end of the summer in 1862 several hundred more joined the community ; Metlakatla was officially established that year within what was by then the Colony of British Columbia . When the 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic killed 500 in Lax Kwalaams but only five in Metlakatla , Duncan had no qualms in convincing his flock that this was divine providence .",
      "In the early 1870s the Rev . William Henry Collison served with Duncan in Metlakatla , and Collisons memoir In the Wake of the War Canoe provides a portrait of the community .",
      "The community grew . In Metlakatla , Duncan exerted his own brand of low church Anglicanism , which involved a set of rules for Christian living and , controversially , eschewing the sacrament of communion so as not to whet the cannibalistic appetites of a people who he worried might be beholden to the anthropophagous rites of their secret societies .",
      "Duncans Rules at Metlakatla .",
      "1 . To give up their Ahlied or Indian devilry",
      "2 . To cease calling in conjurers when sick",
      "3 . To cease gambling",
      "4 . To cease giving away their property for display ( i.e . the potlatch )",
      "5 . To cease painting their faces",
      "6 . To cease drinking intoxicating liquor",
      "7 . To rest on the Sabbath",
      "8 . To attend religious instruction",
      "9 . To send their children to school",
      "10 . To be cleanly",
      "11 . To be industrious",
      "12 . To be peaceful",
      "13 . To be liberal and honest in trade",
      "14 . To build neat houses",
      "15 . To pay the village tax",
      "New Metlakatla in Alaska .",
      "Such doctrinal differences , plus Duncans insistence on total control over his parishioners lives , led to a split with the Church of England . Duncan was expelled from the CMS in 1881 and transformed his mission into a nondenominational Independent Native Church . Eventually , he decided to found a second utopian community on Annette Island , Alaska , on the territory of the Tongass tribe of Tlingit . He obtained permission from the US government\u2014travelling to testify before Congress himself\u2014to establish an Indian reservation there ( still Alaskas sole Indian reservation ) , then led approximately 800 Tsimshians in a canoe voyage from Old Metlakatla to New Metlakatla , Alaska , in 1887 .",
      "The new community was successful , especially economically successful , with a sawmill , cannery , and other enterprises . Economic self-sufficiency was a core tenet of Duncans vision for the community .",
      "His split with the Church of England was not amicable and involved ( according to one version of events ; see Johnson in bibliography ) sending a canoe-load of Tsimshians , including Peter Simpson , back to Old Metlakatla to destroy the old church there , on the grounds that ownership of it should not revert to the CMS . The religious orientation of New Metlakatla became a nondemoninational form of low-church Anglicanism , quite evangelical , and under the strict doctrinal control of Duncan himself .",
      "Rivalries with other local leaders .",
      "Later , portions of the community , notably those under the leadership of the Rev . Edward Marsden , defected to Presbyterianism , the dominant faith of the surrounding Tlingit communities . Marsden even assisted in the establishment of a rival , Presbyterian Tsimshian community at nearby Port Gravina ( 1892\u20131904 ) and , later , campaigned tirelessly and with some success for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to oust Duncan from his position , partly on grounds that Duncan had too much authority in the community and opposed any Native self-betterment through education and individual economic self-sufficiency if it put parishioners out of his personal control . In 1914\u20131915 , the Interior Department seized many of the Mission buildings and built a modern school at Metlakatla .",
      "The Marsden-Duncan feud , as well as the long legal , political , and personal struggle between Duncan and William Ridley , the Anglican bishop in charge of northern British Columbia , intersected , most notoriously , with charges of sexual misconduct against Duncan , charges which have severely tainted his historical reputation , though he was never convicted or punished , and the charge was later concluded to be slander by the Commission of Indian Affairs .",
      "He also managed to make an enemy of the medical missionary Robert Tomlinson , an Anglican who had served under him in B.C . and been an ally in his dissent from the CMS . Tomlinson and his son Robert Tomlinson Jr . served in Metlakatla , Alaska , with Duncan from 1908 to 1912 before leaving for B.C . again out of disenchantment with the way Duncan was running the community .",
      "Death and legacy .",
      "Duncan died at the age of 86 on 30 August 1918 , in New Metlakatla , Alaska after a months-long decline associated with a bronchial infection apparently resulting from a fall .",
      "Duncan remains an extraordinarily controversial figure in Tsimshian communities today , with many fierce admirers and many fierce detractors .",

      "Soko\u0142owsko",
      "Soko\u0142owsko ( ) is a village and traditional climatic health resort in Gmina Mierosz\u00f3w , within Wa\u0142brzych County , Lower Silesian Voivodeship , in south-western Poland . Prior to 1945 it was in Germany . It lies approximately north-east of Mierosz\u00f3w , south of Wa\u0142brzych , and south-west of the regional capital Wroc\u0142aw .",
      "Geography .",
      "Located about north-east of Mierosz\u00f3w , south of Wa\u0142brzych , and south-west of the regional capital Wroc\u0142aw , Soko\u0142owsko is the largest village within the Stone Mountains of the Central Sudetes . It is situated in a deep forest-covered hollow traversed by the Soko\u0142owiec and Dziczy streams , at an altitude of above sea level . The border with the town of Mezim\u011bst\u00ed in the Czech Republic is about in the south .",
      "Soko\u0142owsko is surrounded by several forested mountains , predominantly made up from porphyry rocks : Sto\u017cek Ma\u0142y ( ) in the north-west and Masyw Bukowca ( ) in the north-east , as well as Garbatka ( ) in the south-west , W\u0142ostowa ( ) in the south and south-east and Radosno ( in the east . The range offers numerous trails for hiking and cross-country skiing in winter .",
      "History .",
      "It is difficult to indicate the exact foundation date of the village . The area had originally been part of the County of K\u0142odzko , acquired by Bohemia under Duke Sob\u011bslav I in 1137 . His successors of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty became hereditary Bohemian kings by order of Emperor Frederick II in 1212 and promoted the German Ostsiedlung . Soko\u0142owsko was probably founded about 1250 by monks of the Benedictine Order at Police , a filial monastery of B\u0159evnov Abbey in Prague .",
      "The first record of Girbrechtsdorff is documented in a 1357 deed itemising the villages within the burgraviate of Radosno castle ( German : Freudenburg ) , that fell to the Piast Duke Bolko II the Small of \u015awidnica shortly afterwards , whose duchy in turn was finally incorporated as a Silesian fief of the Bohemian crown in 1392 . During the 15th century G\u00f6rbersdorf had several possessors and suffered from the Hussite Wars . Together with the southern part of the former Duchy of \u015awidnica the village passed to the Imperial counts of Hoberg ( Hochberg ) at Ksi\u0105\u017c , the later Princes of Pless . With the Bohemian kingdom the area fell to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1526 and was seized by Prussia under King Frederick II in the First Silesian War of 1742 . From 1815 G\u00f6rbersdorf was part of the Prussian Province of Silesia .",
      "G\u00f6rbersdorf didnt differentiate from neighbouring villages until it was visited in 1849 by Countess Maria von Colomb , a niece of Prussian General Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher . The countess , delighted by the scenery , persuaded her brother-in-law Hermann Brehmer to establish a health resort for consumptive patients . In 1854 she and Brehmer opened the worlds first sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis at G\u00f6rbersdorf . The care included the Priessnitz method of hydrotherapy and also a precursory method of climatic-dietetic treatment was applied . The treatment of consumption practised by Alexander Spengler at Davos , perpetuated by Thomas Manns novel The Magic Mountain , was modelled after G\u00f6rbersdorf , which at times was called the Silesian Davos , although perhaps Davos should be called the Swiss G\u00f6rbersdorf . The resort was relatively expensive , but well organised , and before 1888 it had both a post office and phone lines . At the same time the quantity of 730 curates well exceeded the number of inhabitants . Several further sanatoriums were established in the following years and until World War I , G\u00f6rbersdorf had become popular with guests from all over Europe , who had numerous mansions and even a Russian Orthodox chapel erected . At the beginning of the 20th century Scandinavian guests introduced snow skiing and a ski jumping hill was opened in 1930 .",
      "Post World War II .",
      "In 1945 G\u00f6rbersdorf , now belonging to Poland , was named Soko\u0142owsko in honour of the Polish internist Alfred Soko\u0142owski who had been a close co-worker of Hermann Brehmer . The now-called Grunwald sanatorium has continued to operate as a public anti-consumptive resort , while large parts of the facilities decayed . On the initiative of medical director Stanis\u0142aw Domin the treatment profile was broadened to all kind of lung diseases , later also dementia . The filmmaker Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski , whose father suffered from tuberculosis , spent several years of his youth at Soko\u0142owsko .",
      "In the 1970s the settlement was being transformed into Provincial Centre of Winter Sports , but due to lack of resources the project was not completed . Soko\u0142owsko didnt regain its village status until the beginning of the 21st century . In the recent years , some of the mansions were renovated . The Russian Orthodox Archangel Michael chapel has been rebuilt by the Catholic Renovabis organisation .",

She also reprimanded Wenstrup and the other House members who supported the lawsuit : The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House . Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution , they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions . New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell , citing section three of the 14th Amendment , called for Pelosi to not seat Wenstrup and the other Republicans who signed the brief supporting the suit , arguing that the text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States .

      "The Greenbelt News Review is a weekly newspaper that was established in 1937 as a volunteer cooperative shortly after settlement of Greenbelt , Maryland , and was originally named the Greenbelt Cooperator until its name was changed in 1954 . It has been published without interruption every week since its founding , and is distributed free by a network of carriers to all city residents .",
      "The News Review was always intended to be a newspaper created by and for the citizens of Greenbelt ; more than a voice in the town , it was meant to be the voice of Greenbelt as a whole . Since its early days , many of the prominent editors and newspaper staff have been women : Mary Lou Williamson held the job of editor for the longest , over twenty-five years , and frequently shared the role with Dorothy Sucher throughout the 1960s as a result of both of them having babies . Other female staffers include Virginia Beauchamp , editor in 1962 ; Mary Granofsky , editor from 1967 to 1972 ; Barbara Likowski , editor during parts of 1989 and 1990 ; and Elaine Skolnik , who began working at the paper in 1954 and served as editor from 1977 to 1986 . Harry Zubkoff was also a prominent editor , holding the position four times throughout the 1950s and 1960s and impressing other staffers with his firebrand opinions .",
      "1970 Supreme Court libel case .",
      "In 1965 , an article by reporter Dorothy Sucher in the News Review published two quotations of citizen remarks at City Council meetings in which they characterized as blackmail the actions of Charles S . Bresler , a local real estate developer and member of the Maryland House of Delegates . Bresler filed suit in 1966 , claiming that he had become the most hated man in Greenbelt . Local volunteers formed a Freedom of the Press committee and went door to door to raise money for the papers legal defense .",
      "Bresler received a $17,500 libel judgment from the Prince Georges County Circuit Court , which was upheld by the Maryland Court of Appeals in 1969 .",
      "In 1970 , the Supreme Court of the United States ruled unanimously in favor of the News Review and overturned the lower courts judgments . The Supreme Court held that as a matter of constitutional law , the word blackmail in these circumstances was not slander when spoken , and not libel when reported in the Greenbelt News Review .",

      "Life .",
      "Her father was Welf I ( d . 825 ) , Count of Altorf in Alamannia ; her mother was Hedwig ( Heilwig ; c . 775 \u2013 after 833 ) , a daughter of the Saxon count Isambart . Emmas elder sister was Judith , who in February 819 married the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious , and thereby became Queen consort of the Franks and Holy Roman Empress . The marriage marked a crucial step forward in the rise of the Welf dynasty .",
      "In 827 , probably at the instigation of Judith , Hemma married Louis the German , the youngest son of Emperor Louis the Pious from his first marriage with Ermengarde of Hesbaye , and stepson of Hemmas sister Judith . The wedding ceremony possibly took place in Regensburg , where Louis the German resided as King of Bavaria subordinate to his father . In 833 , Hemma received Oberm\u00fcnster Abbey in Regensburg from her husband .",
      "Emperor Louis died in 840 . After severe innerdynastic struggles , the Carolingian Empire eventually was divided according to the Treaty of Verdun in 843 . The Kingdom of Bavaria was merged with Louis the Germans Kingdom of East Francia ( the predecessor of the Kingdom of Germany ) , and his wife Hemma became the first East Frankish queen .",
      "Hemma is rarely mentioned in contemporary sources ; she does not seem to have had much influence on her husbands rule . The Annales Bertiniani written by Archbishop Hincmar of Reims however reproach her for a pride which displeased the people of Italy . She is also said to have inordinately favoured her son Carloman , designated heir of his father in Bavaria , which led to a revolt by his brothers .",
      "Hemma suffered a stroke in 874 and subsequently became paralyzed and speechless ; King Louis visited her the last time in 875 . She died on 31 January 876 , a few months before her husband , and was buried in St . Emmerams Abbey , Regensburg .

      "Hildegarde Naughton ( born 1 May 1977 ) is an Irish Fine Gael politician who has served as Minister of State attending cabinet since June 2020 . She has been a Teachta D\u00e1la ( TD ) for the Galway West constituency since 2016 . She previously served as Chair of the Committee on Communications , Climate Action and the Environment from 2016 to 2020 and Mayor of Galway from 2011 to 2012 . She also served as a Senator from 2013 to 2016 , after being nominated by the Taoiseach .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Naughton was born in Galway in 1977 , she is from Oranmore . Naughton is the only daughter of P.J . and Marguerite Naughton . Her father was a member of the Fine Gael National Executive . She was teacher at St . Patricks Boys School in Galway . She is a classically trained soprano , and in 2008 won the Association of Irish Musical Societies Best Actress award for her role as Eliza Doolittle in the Galway Patrician Musical Societys production of My Fair Lady . She speaks fluent French . She was co-ordinator of the 2007 Telethon People in Need Campaign for Galway City and County , which raised over \u20ac300,000 for local charities .",
      "Political career .",
      "Naughton surprised many by unseating party colleague John Mulholland at the 2009 local election in the Galway City West local electoral area ( Salthill-Claddagh-Knocknacarra ) . John Cunningham suggested that personal networking , effective postering , and the endorsement of Maureen Egan aided her victory . After her election , she was a director on Galway City Partnership Board and a member of Galway City Councils Transport Strategic Policy Committee and the Galway City Vocational Education Committee .",
      "Naughton ran unsuccessfully for the D\u00e1il at the 2011 general election in Galway West . During the campaign in January , she alleged that councillors had been doing the bidding of a hidden elite for 20 years . In June , she was Fine Gaels choice for Mayor of Galway for 2011\u201312 , part of a pact rotating the post between Fine Gael , Labour Party , and some Independent members . Her nomination was in doubt after Councillors objected to her allegation the previous January . She unreservedly withdrew the comments before the mayoral vote was taken .",
      "She caused controversy when she used her casting vote as Mayor to deny David Norris the right to address Galway City Council during his campaign to get a nomination for the 2011 presidential election . She later claimed it was a misunderstanding .",
      "At the 2011 general election , Naughton was one of four Fine Gael candidates for the five seats in Galway West ; Se\u00e1n Kyne and Brian Walsh were elected , while Naughton and Fidelma Healy Eames were unsuccessful . In July 2013 , Walsh was expelled from the Fine Gael parliamentary party for voting against the party whip on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 . Healy Eames was expelled a week after Walsh for opposing the same bill in the Seanad . On 19 July , Naughton was appointed to the Seanad by Taoiseach Enda Kenny . Walsh was readmitted into the Fine Gael parliamentary party in 2014 , but due to health reasons , he stood down before the general election .",
      "At the 2016 general election , Naughton was elected to the D\u00e1il alongside her party colleague Se\u00e1n Kyne . In October 2019 , she was appointed to the chair of the D\u00e1il committee investigating ethics complaints about members who voted on behalf of colleagues . She was later forced to resign after it came to light that she had done the same on several occasions . Voting on behalf of colleagues in the D\u00e1il was not permitted . At the 2020 general election , Naughton was re-elected to the D\u00e1il , as the sole Fine Gael TD in the five-seat constituency .",
      "In 2020 , at the formation of the 32nd Government of Ireland , Naughton was appointed as one of three Ministers of State attending cabinet . She was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Transport with special responsibility for International and Road Transport and Logistics and Minister of State at the Department of the Environment , Climate and Communications with special responsibility for Postal Policy and Eircodes . From 27 April , Naughton was assigned additional responsibilities as Minister of State at the Department of Justice with responsibility for criminal justice during the maternity leave of Minister for Justice Helen McEntee .",

The North and South blocks , which were built by Higgs and Hill , were added between 1936 and 1939 . The Island block was not completed until 1974 .",
      "For 64 years County Hall served as the headquarters of local government for London . During the 1980s the then powerful Labour-controlled GLC led by Ken Livingstone was locked in conflict with the Conservative national government of Margaret Thatcher . The fa\u00e7ade of County Hall frequently served as a billboard for opposition slogans which could be seen from the Palace of Westminster .",
      "When the government of Margaret Thatcher abolished the GLC in 1986 , County Hall lost its role as the seat of Londons government . Talk soon became of what was to happen to the building , and there were plans to relocate the London School of Economics to the site which did not proceed . The building remained in use by the Inner London Education Authority ( ILEA ) until its abolition in 1990 when the building was transferred to the London Residuary Body and eventually sold to Shirayama Shokusan , a Japanese investor . On 21 October 2005 , the High Court of England and Wales upheld a bid by the owners of the building , Shirayama Shokusan , to have the Saatchi Gallery evicted on grounds of violating its contract , particularly using space outside of the rented area for exhibits .",
      "The Island block , an annex of the main building , was demolished in 2006 to make way for a hotel , the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge . The building , also known as No 1 Westminster Bridge Road , had been disused since 1986 and had become a derelict eyesore .",

      "Lena Margaret Ashwell , Lady Simson ( born Lena Margaret Pocock ; 28 September 1872 \u2013 13 March 1957 ) was a British actress and theatre manager and producer , known as the first to organise large-scale entertainment for troops at the front , which she did during World War I . After the war she created the Lena Ashwell Players .",
      "Biography .",
      "She was born Lena Margaret Pocock on the Wellesley while anchored in the River Tyne at North Shields , at the time under her fathers command as a home for \u201cboys unconvicted of crime but under suspicion\u201d . Ashwells father was Commander Charles Ashwell Boteler Pocock , Royal Navy ( March 1829\u2013February 1899 ) , a nephew of Nicholas Pocock , and her mother was Sarah Margaret Stevens ( December 1839\u2013May 1887 ) , who died as a result of an accident in Canada . Lena , the second youngest of seven siblings , had two brothers and four sisters . One of her siblings died as a child while the family was in New Zealand .",
      "She grew up in Canada , and studied music in both Lausanne and at the Royal Academy of Music in London . Her voice however was insufficient for performance and she took up acting instead , thereafter styling herself as Lena Ashwell . In 1891 , she debuted in The Pharisee , and in 1895 she appeared in King Arthur , by J . Comyns Carr , with Dame Ellen Terry , Genevieve Ward and Sir Henry Irving , all wearing costumes made by Ada Nettleship . She went on to appear in a number of Shakespeare productions , in Quo Vadis ( 1900 ) , and as the lead in Mrs Danes Defence ( 1900 ) and Leah Kleschna ( 1905 ) .",
      "In 1906 , Ashwell starred in The Shulamite , a melodrama about a South African woman in an unhappy marriage who falls in love with a visiting Englishman . The show ran for 45 performances at the Savoy Theatre between 12 May and 26 June 1906 .",
      "Ashwell took the play to the US , where it ran for just 25 performances at the Lyric Theatre on Broadway . The New York Times critic wrote that Ashwell had been rather badly handicapped on her first visit here by a bad play .",
      "Beginning in 1906 , Ashwell took up theatre management , initially at the Savoy Theatre , then in 1907 she established her own theatre known as the Kingsway .",
      "In February 1914 , Ashwell was one of the founder members of the new United Suffragists group , led by Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence , and the Harbens which broke away from the moderate NUWSS and the militant WSPU suffragettes , although it welcomed former members of each , and men as well as women who were seeking womens rights . When the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed and ( some ) women were given the vote , the group disbanded itself .",
      "World War One .",
      "During World War I she was an enthusiastic supporter of British war aims . Partly due to the influence of her acquaintance Princess Helena Victoria , and her connections to the YWCA , she was given permission to take a group of entertainers to the Western Front . In 1915 , she began to organise companies of actors , singers and entertainers to travel to France and perform ; by the end of the war there were 25 of them , travelling in small groups around France . Ashwell herself travelled to the front and became involved in fundraising and logistics of the concerts , as she believed in uplifting and therapeutic power of music . She organised all-male concert parties to perform shows near to the front line . In her writings about this experience she emphasised that ordinary soldiers had been enthusiastic about high culture \u2013 in particular , Shakespeare plays . She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) for her efforts in organising such shows .",
      "After the war .",
      "After the war Ashwell sought funding from the Carnegie Trust and the British Drama League . After some years the trustees allowed her a \u00a3500 grant for capital outlay after get good results of a survey of local councils . The aim was to bring theatre to London , but some areas such as Canning Town were thought to be a very likely loss maker . The Drama League agreed to underwrite up to \u00a3100 of losses there . By 1923 there was a Friends of the Players with members receiving the Lena Ashley Players Magazine . Ashwell formed the Lena Ashwell Players Ltd in April 1923 . The directors were Ashwell , Esme Church , Marion Fawcett and Cicely Hamilton . The first three of these were to be the companys theatre managers and Fawcett was also the first manager of the new company .",
      "The players continued to appear throughout London and of whom Laurence Olivier was later to become a member . In 1924 , she took over the old Bijou Theatre in Bayswater , London and renamed it The Century Theatre . This became the headquarters of The Lena Ashwell Players . It was there that she produced new plays including her own adaptations of Crime and Punishment and Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde .",
      "In her last years , she embraced the Moral Re-Armament movement .",
      "Her ashes are buried with her husband in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh . The grave lies in the Victorian north extension on a north-south path north of the main path close to Elsie Maud Inglis .",
      "Family .",
      "She married actor Arthur Playfair in 1896 . He was an alcoholic , committed adultery , domestic violence and passed on venereal disease . He began divorce proceedings in 1903 following her adultery with Robert Taber , the former husband of actress Julia Marlowe . Playfair and Ashwell finally divorced in 1908 .",
      "She married the royal obstetrician Sir Henry John Forbes Simson in 1908 , who had the claim to fame of delivering both the future Queen Elizabeth II and her sister Princess Margaret . She met him through her cousin , Sir Alfred Fripp , surgeon to the King , who recommended Simson to her .",
      "Writing .",
      "Ashwell wrote four books :",

      "Licia Albanese",
      "Licia Albanese ( July 22 , 1909 \u2013 August 15 , 2014 ) was an Italian-born American operatic soprano . Noted especially for her portrayals of the lyric heroines of Verdi and Puccini , Albanese was a leading artist with the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1966 . She also made many recordings and was chairwoman of The Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation , which is dedicated to assisting young artists and singers .",
      "Life and career .",
      "Felicia Albanese was born in July 1909 in Torre Pelosa , ( a subdivision of Noicattaro , Italy ) , later become Torre a Mare , a quarter of Bari ( the chief town of the Apulia region ) . She made her unofficial debut in Milan in 1934 , when she replaced another soprano in Puccinis Madama Butterfly , the role for which she would be celebrated . Over 40 years , she sang more than 300 performances of Cio-Cio-San . Although she has been praised for many of her roles , including Mim\u00ec , Violetta , Li\u00f9 and Manon Lescaut , it is her portrayal of the geisha which has remained her best known . Her connection with that work began early with her teacher , Giuseppina Baldassare-Tedeschi , a contemporary of the composer , and an important exponent of the title role in the previous generation .",
      "There is some controversy regarding when she made her formal debut . It was either in that same year ( 1934 ) at the Teatro Municipale in Bari , singing in La boh\u00e8me , or in Parma , or in Milan in 1935 in Madama Butterfly . By the end of that year , she had debuted at La Scala as Lauretta in Gianni Schicchi . She soon realized great success all over the world , especially for her performances in Carmen , Lamico Fritz and Madama Butterfly in Italy , France and England .",
      "Albanese made her Metropolitan Opera debut on February 9 , 1940 , in the first of 72 performances as Madama Butterfly at the old Metropolitan Opera House in spite of the fact that after the December 7 , 1941 Pearl Harbor attack , performances of that opera were banned in the U.S . until the end of World War II . Her success was instantaneous , and Albanese remained at the Met for 26 seasons , performing a total of 427 performances of 17 roles in 16 operas . She left the company in 1966 in a dispute with General Manager Sir Rudolf Bing , without a grand farewell . After performing in four productions during 1965/66 , she was scheduled for only one performance the next season . She returned her contract unsigned .",
      "Arturo Toscanini invited Albanese to join his broadcast concert performances of La boh\u00e8me and La traviata with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in NBCs Studio 8H in 1946 . Both performances were later issued on LP and CD by RCA Victor .",
      "In 1959 , Albanese sang for thousands of radio listeners in collaboration with Alfredo Antonini , Richard Tucker and members of the New York Philharmonic during the popular Italian Night broadcasts from Lewisohn Stadium in New York City . She and her colleagues were showcased in selections from operas by Giacomo Puccini including : Tosca , La boh\u00e8me , Turandot , Manon Lescaut and Madama Butterfly .",
      "She was also a mainstay at the San Francisco Opera where she sang between 1941 and 1961 , performing 22 roles in 120 performances over 20 seasons , remaining in part because of her admiration for its director , Gaetano Merola . Throughout her career , she continued to perform widely in recital , concert , and opera , she was heard throughout the country ; she participated in benefits , entertained the troops , had her own weekly radio show , was a guest on other broadcasts and telecasts , and recorded frequently .",
      "Albanese went to San Francisco in the summer of 1972 for the special gala concert at Sigmund Stern Recreation Grove celebrating the 50th anniversary of the San Francisco Opera . Joining numerous colleagues who had sung with the company , Albanese sang the duet from Madama Butterfly with tenor Frederick Jagel , accompanied by the San Francisco Opera Orchestra conducted by longtime director Kurt Herbert Adler .",
      "Even after a career spanning seven decades , Albanese continued to perform occasionally . After hearing her sing the national anthem during a Met opening , Stephen Sondheim and Thomas Z . Shepard cast her as operetta diva Heidi Schiller in Sondheims Follies in concert with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in 1985 . During the 1987 spring season of the Theatre Under the Stars in Houston , Texas , Albanese starred in a stage revival of Follies , which was a great success .",
      "Albanese died on August 15 , 2014 , at the age of 105 in her home in Manhattan .",
      "Her popularity in La traviata was such that she sang more performances of that opera at the Met and the San Francisco Opera than any other singer in either companys history . Schuyler Chapin describes her as a splendid former prima donna of the Italian repertoire , remembered by old-timers as the frailest Mim\u00ec , the tenderest Butterfly , and perhaps the most haunting of modern Violettas .",
      "Her voice had a distinctive character which the Italians call a lirico spinto , marked by its quick vibrato , incisive diction , intensity of attack and unwavering emotional impact . During her career she performed with many of the contemporary greats of opera\u2014Beniamino Gigli , Claudia Muzio , Jussi Bj\u00f6rling , and Franco Corelli . She worked with some of the best conductors of her time , but it is her work with Toscanini that has endured . Despite her talent and numerous performances , she was not the best known of her contemporaries , overshadowed in her day by Zinka Milanov , Maria Callas , Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles and Renata Tebaldi .",
      "Alfredo Vecchio , a frequent member of the audience at her performances , gave the following tribute to the career of Albanese at the Columbus Club , Park Avenue , New York City , in 1986 :",
      "Like all great artists , Licias specific ingenuity as a singer , the originality of her art , lay in the fact that technique for this artist at least was always a means to an end and never an end in itself : for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions . Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born , contrary to musical training she acquired , and , if such exists , contrary to her musical morality . It was this , Licias uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me , which drew us , into the world of Mimi , Cio-Cio-San , Manon , Liu and Violetta week after week , year after year , inviting me to a place and places I had never been before . It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licias first Violetta : She did not sing the role , she recreated it for our times . As we all know , Albaneses art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic , from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette : and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces , she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest .",
      "To all of her work , Albanese brought passion and commitment , with her rich soprano voice , equalized throughout its range , thrilling in its climaxes . However , despite her repeated performances , she never fell into routine . As she explained in a 2004 interview with Allan Ulrich of the San Francisco Chronicle , I always changed every performance . I was never boring , and I am against copying . What I learned from the great singers was not to copy , but that the drama is in the music .",
      "Recordings and legacy .",
      "Albanese appeared in the very first live telecast from the Metropolitan Opera , Verdis Otello , opposite Ram\u00f3n Vinay and Leonard Warren , conducted by Fritz Busch . One of the first generation of opera singers to appear widely in recordings and on the radio , her performances , now reappearing on both compact disc and video , have provided a lasting testament to her ability . From these recordings , future generations will be able to form some impression of what she was like as a singer and to understand what made her unique as an artist .",
      "Arturo Toscanini invited Albanese to sing Mim\u00ec in the 1946 NBC Symphony Orchestra performance of La boh\u00e8me . The broadcast marked the 50th anniversary of the operas premiere which he had conducted in 1896 . The following season Toscanini cast her again , this time as Violetta in a now-classic performance of La traviata , broadcast nationally on NBC Radio on December 1 and 8 , 1946 . Both performances were subsequently released on records by RCA Victor and have since continuously remained in print .",
      "Albanese was noted for the grace with which she performed La traviata under the maestros famously intense direction . Maria Callas once asked me how I ever got through it , but Toscanini wanted it that way , Albanese later recalled . It should be like champagne , he said . I complained to him , and he said , You can do it . Before I sang the part , I went to a hospital to study the behavior of people with tuberculosis and I learned that sometimes they can be hysterical .",
      "She recorded mainly for RCA Victor . Among her recordings are Bizets Carmen under the direction of Fritz Reiner , with Ris\u00eb Stevens and Jan Peerce ( 1951 ) and Puccinis Manon Lescaut with Jussi Bj\u00f6rling and Robert Merrill , conducted by Jonel Perlea ( 1954 ) . For a 1951 recording conducted by Leopold Stokowski of Tatianas Letter Scene from Tchaikovskys Eugene Onegin , a part she had never sung before , she learnt Russian especially for the occasion .",
      "Soprano Teresa Stratas was quoted as crediting a Metropolitan Opera performance of La traviata starring Albanese at Torontos Maple Leaf Gardens , with motivating her toward a singing career .",
      "Albanese was chairman of The Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation , founded in 1974 and dedicated to assisting young artists and singers . She also served as a trustee of the Bagby Foundation . She worked with the Juilliard School of Music , the Manhattan School of Music , and Marymount Manhattan College , and conducted master classes throughout the world .",
      "National and international honors .",
      "Albanese became a United States citizen in 1945 . On October 5 , 1995 , President Bill Clinton presented her with the National Medal of Honor for the Arts .",
      "She received awards and honorary degrees from Marymount Manhattan College , Montclair State Teachers College , Saint Peters College , New Jersey , Seton Hall University , University of South Florida , Fairfield University , Siena College , Caldwell College , and Fairleigh Dickinson University .",
      "She was awarded the prestigious Handel Medallion , the highest official honor given by the City of New York and presented to individuals for their contributions to the citys cultural life , from Rudolph Giuliani in 2000 . At the ceremony , Mayor Giuliani commemorated the career of a woman who is without question [ one ] of the most loved and respected performers in the world .",

      "Helmut Lang ( fashion brand )",
      "The Helmut Lang fashion brand was created by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang in 1986 . The Helmut Lang brand still exists today , but has been carried on without Langs involvement since 2005 .",
      "The label .",
      "Helmut Lang , a fashion autodidact , set up a made-to-measure fashion studio in Vienna in 1977 and opened a boutique there in 1979 at the age of 23 . His clothes were fairly successful in his native Austria , and , after presenting his work as part of an exhibition titled lApocalypse Joyeuse at the Centre Pompidou in Paris , initiated by the Austrian government , he branched out successfully to Paris in 1986 and created the label Helmut Lang .",
      "At this time in the late 1980s and early 1990s , minimalist fashion was at its height . His clothes were made with very sharp lines and careful cuts , creating basic but extremely elegant silhouettes in high quality and often high-tech fabrics . His work has been compared to Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto for his sometimes austere , intellectual designs .",
      "Lang is known for his minimalist , deconstructivist , and often severe designs . His fashion house became famous in the late 1980s for its simple but refined designs , its slim suits in black or white , its denim collection , and the use of high-tech fabrics . Helmut Lang fashions were sold in upscale department stores and through select retailers , as well as in signature Helmut Lang stores around the world . In 1999 , Lang entered into a partnership with Prada Group which resulted in the acquisition of the Helmut Lang brand by Prada in 2004 , and Mr . Langs departure from the label in 2005 . Prada consequently sold it to Link Theory of Japan in 2006 . Link Theory re-launched the Helmut Lang label with new designers in 2007 . Since then , Helmut Lang fashions have been available again at upscale department stores and signature Helmut Lang boutiques worldwide .",
      "New York City .",
      "Lang moved to New York in 1997 and subsequently set up his companys headquarters in 80 Greene St . in SoHo in 1998 . In New York , he decided in April 1998 , three days before his designs were to be presented to a New York audience , to show his collection through a live internet broadcast to the world , via the newly created companys web site . As a first in the fashion industry , ads for the brand could be seen on New York taxi tops from 1998 to 2004 . The following season he announced to show his collections not only before New York Fashion Week , but also before the Milan and Paris runway shows . As a result , with many American designers following suit , New York Fashion Week was permanently moved up six weeks to herald the established runway shows . From 2000 on , unconventional print ads for the brand were placed with National Geographic magazine .",
      "Helmut Lang fashion .",
      "Throughout the years , both a womens and mens line existed , kept under a single name and always presented in one fashion show . Underwear ( 1995 ) and jeans ( 1996 ) lines as well as accessories , such as footwear ( 1990 ) and fragrances ( 1999 ) were launched , but otherwise the brand was kept unified to solidify its identity and strength .",
      "The runway show venues for the Helmut Lang label were switched from Paris ( until 1998 ) to New York by Mr . Lang and back again to Paris by Prada ( from 2002 to 2005 ) . The collections/presentations used to be called ( working sessions ) by Mr . Lang .",
      "Prada partnership .",
      "In 1999 , Milan-based fashion house Prada acquired 51% of the Helmut Lang company in the course of a multi-brand strategy , which also included the acquisition of German fashion label Jil Sander .",
      "After alleged disputes with Prada Groups CEO Patrizio Bertelli on how the brand should be continued , and after Mr . Lang had sold his remaining shares to Prada in October 2004 , he left his own label in January 2005 . Lang joined the growing number of designer departures , including Jil Sander from her own label at Prada and Tom Ford from Gucci . However , Mr . Lang has publicly maintained that he had no problem with Mr . Bertelli .",
      "Acquisition by Link Theory .",
      "On March 17 , 2006 , Prada Group announced that , after six loss-making years , Link Theory Holdings ( LTH ) of Tokyo would be acquiring the Helmut Lang brand for an estimated \u20ac20 million . This came about three weeks after Prada had sold the Jil Sander label to British equity firm Change Capital Partners ( CCP ) . Already in spring 2005 , it had been rumored that Prada was trying to sell the label . Prada Group was said to want to concentrate on its core labels , Prada and Miu Miu , again . The Japanese holding company LTH , developer of the theory fashion label in Japan and the US , re-launched the Helmut Lang collections under the direction of a suitable designer for the spring/summer 2007 season ( presented in fall 2006 ) , in select boutiques worldwide as a contemporary brand . The new label is based out of New York City .",
      "It was never expected that Lang himself would return to the label that bears his name , although Chikara Sasake , president and chief executive of LTH , gave to understand that if Lang wants to come back , the door is always open .",
      "Helmut Lang brand re-launch .",
      "In May 2006 , it was announced that Michael and Nicole Colovos , an American-New Zealand designer couple , who formerly had their own Los Angeles-based denim label Habitual , had been installed by Link Theory as creative directors for the new Helmut Lang brand . From February 2007 , select upscale retailers such as Barneys or Bergdorf Goodman started to carry the spring/summer 2007 Helmut Lang contemporary sportswear collection . The design office has been set up in West Chelsea in New York . The collection , described as a commercial reduction of [ Mr . Langs ] fashion identity , has received quite favorable reviews even though it is clearly not seen as a continuation of the original line . The item prices in the collection are about 20% above those for comparable theory items and , hence , below the original Helmut Lang prices . Link Theory expects to generate US$ 8 million in revenues in 2008 , and make a profit in 2009 with the label . The company also announced that over the long term they intend to also establish exclusive Helmut Lang shops in the US , Europe and Japan .",
      "The Helmut Lang web site was re-activated at the end of 2006 and was fully launched in spring 2007 . Mr . Lang , who now resides on Long Island of independent means , is said not to be involved in the labels re-launch in any way .",
      "In February 2014 , Michael and Nicole Colovos , after eight years of being creative directors , left the company . The Colovos designed the 2014 Fall collection called Rough Terrain .",
      "In March 2017 , it was announced that in lieu of a creative designer , Helmut Lang would re-launch with Isabella Burley , editor of the British youth culture magazine Dazed & Confused , as \u201ceditor in residence.\u201d",
      "In January 2018 , it was announced that Alix Browne would be appointed as editor-in-residence , replacing Isabella Burley .",
      "In August 2018 , the brand engaged in a series of layoffs after several years of profitability , with the aim to restructure the organization .",
      "Helmut Lang stores .",
      "Original stores ( until 2005 ) .",
      "All of the original , art-inspired signature Helmut Lang stores that existed in Vienna , Munich , Moscow , Saint Petersburg , Milan , Paris , New York , Hong Kong , Singapore , and Tokyo , as well as several stores-in-store in the Asian market , that existed between 1995 and 2005 have been closed . The last one to close was the Paris location in 2005 .",
      "New stores ( after 2007 ) .",
      "In March 2007 , Link Theory opened the first post-Prada signature Helmut Lang store in Tokyos fashionable Aoyama district . In Japan , the company has since then installed several Helmut Lang stores-in-store at local department stores . In August 2007 , a new freestanding Helmut Lang store was opened on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles . It is , after the Tokyo store , the second signature Helmut Lang store since the closing of the last original store in Paris . The store is adjacent to an existing theory store at 8424 Melrose Avenue . Another Helmut Lang store opened on September 28 , 2007 , on Maiden Lane in San Francisco , in the building previously occupied by Jil Sander . However , in April 2008 , this store was converted into a theory store . In New York City , a temporary pop-up shop opened in mid-December 2007 , while the company is apparently looking for a larger location in the Meatpacking District . May 8 , 2008 , saw the opening of a Helmut Lang outlet store at Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in New York , however , this store has since closed .",

      "Klemzig is a suburb of Adelaide in the City of Port Adelaide Enfield . It was the first settlement of German immigrants in Australia and was named after the village of Klemzig , near Z\u00fcllichau in southeastern Brandenburg in the German state of Prussia , where they originated from . That Klemzig is now in western Poland and is now known by the Polish name Kl\u0119psk .",
      "Background .",
      "The initial establishment of Klemzig as an Old Lutheran settlement in the South Australian Colony is attributed to a decision by Pastor August Ludwig Christian Kavel . Pastor Kavel was determined to help his loyal parishioners emigrate from Brandenburg , Posen and Silesia to escape religious persecution by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia .",
      "Pastor Kavel initially planned to move his parishioners to Russia near the Black Sea , where there were already numerous German settlements , but that had proved not to be feasible . Early in 1836 , Kavel travelled to Hamburg to investigate possible emigration to America , but lack of available financial assistance caused this plan to collapse .",
      "While in Hamburg , Kavel heard of the wealthy philanthropist , George Fife Angas , who was Chairman of the South Australian Company and likely to assist the Old Lutherans with their migration plans .",
      "Kavel and a representative of his congregation travelled to London in March 1836 and met a very sympathetic George Fife Angas . Angas was a Baptist and was convinced that the Old Lutherans , who placed such high value on their religious beliefs , would make excellent settlers in the South Australian Colony .",
      "Angas persuaded the Directors of the South Australian Company to support him in chartering and fitting out the barque Sarah which was to proceed to Hamburg . Here , 370 Old Lutherans were to set sail for South Australia on 8 June 1836 . However , Prussian authorities refused to grant the necessary passports until finally , after a distressing delay of nearly two years , the Prussian Government relented . Over the next six years , many ships brought Kavels Old Lutheran parishioners to the South Australian Colony .",
      "Ships .",
      "Some of the emigrant ships included :",
      "- The barque Bengalee departed Hamburg on 16 July 1838 and after a seven-day stop off at Kingscote ( Kangaroo Island ) arrived in Port Adelaide on 16 November 1838 . On board were 33 passengers .",
      "- The passenger ship The Prince George departed Hamburg on 13 July 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 18 November 1838 . On board were 207 passengers including Pastor Kavel .",
      "- The passenger ship Zebra departed Altona on 28 August 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 27 December 1838 . On board were 191 passengers . A listing of the ships cargo log also reveals that on board were 40,924 bricks presumably for the establishment of new dwellings .",
      "- The barque Cathrina departed Hamburg on 15 September 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 20 January 1839 . On board were 122 passengers .",
      "- The passenger ship Skjold departed Altona on 3 July 1841 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 27 October 1841 . On board were 241 passengers . Official records show that the three-month journey claimed the lives of 41 people .",
      "- The passenger ship Taglione departed London on 20 June 1842 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 13 October 1842 . An unknown number of passengers were on board .",
      "- The passenger ship George Washington departed Hamburg on 23 May 1844 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 12 September 1844 . On board were 184 passengers .",
      "- The schooner Joseph Albino departed London on 4 July 1845 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 8 December 1845 . On board were 7 passengers .",
      "Settlement .",
      "In March 1837 Colonel William Light completed surveying Kangaroo Island , Encounter Bay , Port Lincoln and the Adelaide Plains . Light eventually chose the Adelaide Plains as the most suitable location for the capital .",
      "The first groups of Old Lutheran emigrants arrived in Port Misery between October 1838 and January 1839 . With the assistance of George Fife Angas , many attempted to integrate into the local community by becoming tradespeople and labourers . Due to the scarcity of work , the lack of English as their preferred language , and the prejudice from the already established British farmers , many Old Lutherans found settlement increasingly hard .",
      "In 1838 , Klemzig was founded by these emigrants after George Fife Angas offered a section of land bordering the Torrens River , a few kilometres to the north-east of Adelaide .",
      "Renaming .",
      "Due to anti-German sentiment during World War I , the name of Klemzig was changed , as were many other German place names in Australia at the time . In 1917 Klemzig was renamed Gaza , commemorating the British victory in the Third Battle of Gaza , in which Australian troops had a major role . Klemzig was re-instated as the suburb name with the enactment of the South Australia Nomenclature Act of 1935 on 12 December 1935 , but remnants of the name Gaza still exist with the local football club still bearing the name . During World War II the residents of Klemzig petitioned the Government of South Australia on a number of occasions to have the name Gaza re-instated but these requests were denied .",
      "Transport .",
      "Klemzig is currently serviced by several bus routes , including 271 and 273 along North East Road and 281 on McLauchlan Road , and the suburb is also served by Klemzig Interchange of the O-Bahn Busway .",
      "Torrens Linear Park borders the O-Bahn and River Torrens to the south of the suburb and there is easy access to the CBD as well as neighbouring suburbs ."

      "The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team based in the Los Angeles metropolitan area . The Rams compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) West division . The Rams play their home games at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood , which they share with the Los Angeles Chargers .",
      "The franchise began in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams , based in Cleveland , Ohio . The club was owned by Homer Marshman and featured players such as William Bud Cooper , Harry The Horse Mattos , Stan Pincura , and Mike Sebastian . Damon Buzz Wetzel joined as general manager . The franchise relocated to Los Angeles in 1946 following the 1945 NFL Championship Game victory , making way for Paul Browns Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference and becoming the only NFL championship team to play the following season in another city . The club played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving into a reconstructed Anaheim Stadium in Orange County , California in 1980 . The Rams appeared in Super Bowl XIV , following the 1979 NFL season ( their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history ) , where they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 31\u201319 .",
      "The Rams left southern California and moved to St . Louis , Missouri , following the 1994 NFL season . Five seasons after relocating , the team won Super Bowl XXXIV in a 23\u201316 victory over the Tennessee Titans . The club then played in Super Bowl XXXVI , where they lost 20\u201317 to the New England Patriots . The Rams played in St . Louis until the end of the 2015 NFL season , when they filed notice with the NFL of their intent to relocate back to Los Angeles . The clubs request to move was approved at an owners meeting in January 2016 , and the Rams returned to the city for the 2016 NFL season . The Rams appeared in Super Bowl LIII , where they lost to the New England Patriots 13\u20133 in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI .",
      "The club has won three NFL championships , and is the only NFL franchise to win championships representing three cities ( Cleveland in 1945 , Los Angeles in 1951 , and St . Louis in 1999 ) .",
      "Franchise history .",
      "Cleveland Rams ( 1936\u20131945 ) .",
      "The Cleveland Rams were founded in 1936 by Ohio attorney Homer Marshman and player-coach Damon Wetzel , a former Ohio State star who also played briefly for the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Pirates . Wetzel , who served as general manager , selected the Rams , because his favorite college football team was the Fordham Rams from Fordham University ; Marshman , the principal owner , also liked the name choice . The team was part of the newly formed American Football League and finished the 1936 regular season in second place with a 5\u20132\u20132 record , trailing only the 8\u20133 record of league champion Boston Shamrocks .",
      "The Rams joined the National Football League on February 12 , 1937 , and were assigned to the Western Division . The Rams would be the fourth in a string of short-lived teams based in Cleveland , following the Cleveland Tigers , Cleveland Bulldogs , and Cleveland Indians . From the beginning , they were a team marked by frequent moves , playing in three stadiums over several losing seasons . However , the team featured the Most Valuable Player of the 1939 season , rookie halfback Parker Hall .",
      "In June 1941 , the Rams were bought by Dan Reeves and Fred Levy Jr . Reeves , an heir to his familys grocery-chain business that had been purchased by Safeway , used some of his inheritance to buy his share of the team . Levys family owned the Levy Brothers department store chain in Kentucky and he also came to own the Riverside International Raceway . Levy owned part of the Rams , with Bob Hope another of the owners , until Reeves bought out his partners in 1962 .",
      "The franchise suspended operations and sat out the 1943 season because of a shortage of players during World War II and resumed playing in 1944 . The team finally achieved success in 1945 , which was their last season in Ohio . Adam Walsh took over as head coach that season . Quarterback Bob Waterfield , a rookie from UCLA , passed , ran , and place-kicked his way to the leagues Most Valuable Player award and helped the Rams achieve a 9\u20131 record and win their first NFL Championship , a 15\u201314 home field victory over the Washington Redskins on December 16 . The margin of victory was provided by a safety : Redskins great Sammy Baughs pass bounced off the goal post , then backward , through his teams own end zone . The next season , NFL rules were changed to prevent this from ever again resulting in a score ; instead , it would merely result in an incomplete pass .",
      "First Los Angeles Rams era ( 1946\u20131994 ) .",
      "1946\u20131948 : Starting over in Los Angeles .",
      "On January 12 , 1946 , Reeves was denied a request by the other NFL owners to move the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles and the then-103,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . He threatened to end his relationship with the NFL and get out of the professional football business altogether unless the transfer to Los Angeles was permitted . A settlement was reached and , as a result , Reeves was allowed to move his team to Los Angeles . Consequently , the NFL became the first professional coast-to-coast sports entertainment industry .",
      "From 1933 , when Joe Lillard left the Chicago Cardinals , through 1946 , there were no black players in professional American football . After the Rams had received approval to move to Los Angeles , they entered into negotiations to lease the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . The Rams were advised that a precondition to them getting a lease was that they would have to integrate the team with at least one African-American ; the Rams agreed . Subsequently , the Rams signed Kenny Washington on March 21 , 1946 . The signing of Washington caused all hell to break loose among the owners of the NFL franchises . The Rams added a second black player , Woody Strode , on May 7 , 1946 , giving them two black players going into the 1946 season .",
      "The Rams were the first team in the NFL to play in Los Angeles ( the 1926 Los Angeles Buccaneers represented L.A . but were strictly a traveling team ) , but they were not the only professional football team to play its home games in the Coliseum between 1946 and 1949 . The upstart All-America Football Conference had the Los Angeles Dons compete there as well . Reeves was taking a gamble that Los Angeles was ready for its own professional football team\u2014and suddenly there were two in the City of Angels . Reeves was proven to be correct when the Rams played their first pre-season game against the Washington Redskins in front of a crowd of 95,000 fans . The team finished their first season in L.A . with a 6\u20134\u20131 record , second place behind the Chicago Bears . At the end of the season Walsh was fired as head coach . The Coliseum was home for the Rams for more than 30 years , but the facility was already over 20 years old on the day of the first kickoff .",
      "In 1948 , halfback Fred Gehrke painted horns on the Rams helmets , making the first helmet emblem in pro football . Late in 1949 , the Dons were folded into the Rams when the All-America Football Conference ceased operations .",
      "1949\u20131956 : Three-end formation .",
      "The Rams first heyday in Southern California was from 1949 to 1955 , when they played in the pre-Super Bowl era NFL Championship Game four times , winning once in 1951 . During this period , they had the best offense in the NFL , even though there was a quarterback change from Bob Waterfield to Norm Van Brocklin in 1951 . The defining Offensive players of this period were wide receiver Elroy Hirsch , Van Brocklin and Waterfield . Teamed with fellow Hall of Famer Tom Fears , Hirsch helped create the style of Rams football as one of the first big play receivers . During the 1951 championship season , Hirsch posted a stunning 1,495 receiving yards with 17 touchdowns . The popularity of this wide-open offense enabled the Los Angeles Rams to become the first pro football team to have all their games televised in 1950 .",
      "1957\u20131964 : Newcomers to L.A . and record attendance .",
      "In the late 1950s and early 1960s , the Rams went from being the only major professional sports franchise in Southern California and Los Angeles to being one of five . The Los Angeles Dodgers moved from Brooklyn in 1958 , the Los Angeles Chargers of the upstart AFL was established in 1960 , the Los Angeles Lakers moved from Minneapolis in 1960 , and the Los Angeles Angels were awarded to Gene Autry in 1961 . In spite of this , the Rams continued to thrive in Southern California . In the first two years after the Dodgers moved to California , the Rams drew an average of 83,681 in 1958 and 74,069 in 1959 . The Rams were so popular in Los Angeles that the upstart Chargers chose to relocate to San Diego rather than attempt to compete with the immensely popular Rams . The Los Angeles Times put the Chargers plight as such : Hilton [ the Chargers owner at the time ] quickly realized that taking on the Rams in L.A . was like beating his head against the wall .",
      "During this time , the Rams were not as successful on the field as they had been during their first decade . The teams combined record from 1957 to 1964 was 24\u201335\u20131 ( ) , but the Rams continued to fill the cavernous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on a regular basis . While the National Football Leagues average attendance ranged from the low 30,000s to the low 40,000s during this time , the Rams were drawing anywhere from 10,000 to 40,000 fans more than the league average . In 1957 , the Rams set the all-time NFL attendance record that stood until 2006 and broke the 100,000 mark twice during the 1958 campaign .",
      "1965\u20131969 : The Fearsome Foursome .",
      "The 1960s were defined by the great defensive line of Rosey Grier , Merlin Olsen , Deacon Jones , and Lamar Lundy , dubbed the Fearsome Foursome . It was this group of players who restored the on-field luster of the franchise in 1967 when the Rams reached ( but lost ) the conference championship under head coach George Allen . That 1967 squad became the first NFL team to surpass one million spectators in a season , a feat the Rams repeated the following year . In each of those two years , the L.A . Rams drew roughly double the number of fans that could be accommodated by their current stadium for a full season .",
      "George Allen led the Rams from 1966 to 1970 and introduced many innovations , including the hiring of a young Dick Vermeil as one of the first special teams coaches . Though Allen would enjoy five straight winning seasons and win two divisional titles in his time with the Rams he never won a playoff game with the team , losing in 1967 to Green Bay 28\u20137 and in 1969 23\u201320 to Minnesota . Allen would leave after the 1970 season to take the head coaching job for the Washington Redskins .",
      "1970\u20131972 : Changes .",
      "Quarterback Roman Gabriel played 11 seasons for the Rams from 1962 to 1972 . From 1967 to 1971 , Gabriel led the Rams to either a first- or second-place finish in their division every year . He was voted the MVP of the NFL in 1969 , for a season in which he threw for 2,549 yards and 24 TDs while leading the Rams to the playoffs . During the 1970 season , Gabriel combined with his primary receiver Jack Snow for 51 receptions totaling 859 yards . This was the best of their eight seasons as teammates .",
      "In 1972 , Chicago industrialist Robert Irsay purchased the Rams for $19 million and then traded the franchise to Carroll Rosenbloom for his Baltimore Colts and cash . The Rams remained solid contenders in the 1970s , winning seven straight NFC West championships between 1973 and 1979 . Though they clearly were the class of the NFC in the 1970s along with the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings , they lost the first four conference championship games they played in that decade , losing twice each to Minnesota ( 1974 , 1976 ) and Dallas ( 1975 , 1978 ) and failing to win a league championship .",
      "1973\u20131978 : NFC West champions .",
      "The Rams head coach for this run was Chuck Knox , who led the team through 1977 . His teams featured unremarkable offenses carried into the playoffs annually by elite defensive units . The defining player of the 1970s L.A . Rams was Jack Youngblood . Youngblood was called the Perfect Defensive End by fellow Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen . His toughness was legendary , notably playing on a broken leg during the Rams run to the 1980 Super Bowl . His blue-collar ethic stood in opposition to the perception that the Rams were a soft Hollywood team . However , several Rams players from this period took advantage of their proximity to Hollywood and crossed over into acting after their playing careers ended . Most notable of these was Fred Dryer , who starred in the TV series Hunter from 1984 to 1991 , as well as Olsen , who retired after 1976 , starred in Little House on the Prairie . During the 1977 off-season , the Rams , looking for a veteran quarterback , acquired Joe Namath from the Jets . In spite of a 2\u20131 start to the regular season , Namaths bad knees rendered him nearly immobile and after a Monday night defeat in Chicago , he never played again . With Pat Haden at the helm , the Rams won the division and advanced to the playoffs , but lost at home to Minnesota . Chuck Knox left for the Bills in 1978 , after which Ray Malavasi became head coach . Going 12\u20134 , the team won the NFC West for the sixth year in a row and defeated the Vikings , thus avenging their earlier playoff defeat . However , success eluded them again as they were shut out in the NFC Championship by the Cowboys .",
      "1979 : First Super Bowl appearance .",
      "It was the Rams weakest divisional winner ( an aging 1979 team that only achieved a 9\u20137 record ) that achieved the teams greatest success in that period . Led by third-year quarterback Vince Ferragamo , the Rams shocked the heavily favored and two-time defending NFC champion Dallas Cowboys 21\u201319 in the divisional playoffs , then shut out the upstart Tampa Bay Buccaneers 9\u20130 in the conference championship game to win the NFC and reach their first Super Bowl . Along with Ferragamo , key players for the Rams were halfback Wendell Tyler , offensive lineman Jackie Slater , and Pro Bowl defenders Jack Youngblood and Jack Hacksaw Reynolds .",
      "The Rams opponent in their first Super Bowl was the defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers . The game was a virtual home game for the Rams as it was played in Pasadena at the Rose Bowl . Although some oddsmakers set the Rams as a 10\u00bd-point underdog , the Rams played Pittsburgh very tough , leading at halftime 13\u201310 and at the end of the third quarter 19\u201317 . In the end , however , the Steelers asserted themselves , scoring two touchdowns in the fourth quarter and shutting down the Rams offense to win their fourth Super Bowl , 31\u201319 .",
      "1980\u20131982 : The move to Anaheim .",
      "Prior to the 1979 NFL season , owner Carroll Rosenbloom died in a drowning accident , and his widow , Georgia Frontiere , inherited 70 percent ownership of the team . Frontiere then fired stepson Steve Rosenbloom and assumed total control of Rams operations . As had been planned prior to Rosenblooms death , the Rams moved from their longtime home at the Coliseum to Anaheim Stadium in nearby Orange County in 1980 .",
      "The reason for the move was twofold . First , the NFLs blackout rule in effect then ( repealed in 2015 ) forbade games from being shown on local television if they did not sell out within 72 hours of the opening kickoff . As the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum seated 92,604 at the time , it was rarely possible to sell that many tickets even in the Rams best years , and so most Rams home games were blacked out . Second , this move was following the population pattern in Southern California . During the 1970s and 1980s , the decline of manufacturing industries in the northeastern United States combined with the desire of many people to live in a warmer climate caused a large-scale population shift to the southern and western states . As a result , many affluent new suburbs were built in the Los Angeles area . Anaheim Stadium was originally built in 1966 to be the home of the California Angels . To accommodate the Rams move , the ballpark was reconfigured and enclosed to accommodate a capacity of 69,008 in the football configuration . With their new , smaller home , the Rams had no problem selling out games .",
      "In 1980 , the team posted an 11\u20135 record , but only managed a wild card spot and were sent packing after a loss to the Cowboys . Age and injuries finally caught up with the Rams in 1981 , as they only won six games and missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years ; adding to the woes was Ferragamo being wrested away by the CFLs Montreal Alouettes that year ( although he returned the following season ) . After the 1982 season was shortened to nine games by a strike , the Rams went 2\u20137 , the worst record in the NFC .",
      "In 1982 , the Oakland Raiders moved to Los Angeles and took up residence in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . The combined effect of these two moves was to divide the Rams traditional fan base in two . This was coupled with the early 1980s being rebuilding years for the club , while the Raiders were winners of Super Bowl XVIII in the 1983 season . Meanwhile , the Los Angeles Lakers won championships in 1980 and 1982 en route to winning five titles in that decade , the Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 1981 and 1988 , and even the Los Angeles Kings made a deep run in the playoffs in 1982 , and acquired fan interest following the arrival of Wayne Gretzky in 1988 . As a result , the Rams declined sharply in popularity during the 1980s , despite being playoff contenders for most of the decade .",
      "1983\u20131991 : Robinson takes over the Rams and the Dickerson era .",
      "The hiring of coach John Robinson in 1983 provided a needed boost for pro football in Orange County . The former University of Southern California coach began by cutting the aged veterans left over from the 1970s teams . His rebuilding program began to show results when the team rebounded to 9\u20137 in 1983 and defeated Dallas in the playoffs . However , the season ended after a rout at the hands of the defending champion Redskins . Another trip to the playoffs in 1984 saw them lose to the Giants . They made the NFC Championship Game in 1985 after winning the division , where they were shut out by the eventual champion Chicago Bears 24\u20130 .",
      "The most notable player for the Rams during that period was running back Eric Dickerson , who was drafted in 1983 out of Southern Methodist University and won the Rookie of the Year award . In 1984 , Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards , setting an NFL record . Dickerson ended his five hugely successful years for the Rams in 1987 by being traded to the Indianapolis Colts for a number of players and draft picks after a bitter contract dispute , shortly after the players strike that year ended . Dickerson was the Rams career rushing leader until 2010 , with 7,245 yards . Despite this trade , the Rams remained contenders due to the arrival of the innovative offensive leadership of Ernie Zampese . Zampese brought the intricate timing routes he had used in making the San Diego Chargers a state-of-the-art offense . Under Zampese , the Rams rose steadily from 28th rated offense in 1986 to 3rd in 1990 . The late 1980s Rams featured a gifted young quarterback in Jim Everett , a solid rushing attack and a fleet of talented wide receivers led by Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson .",
      "After a 10\u20136 season in 1986 , the Rams were booted from the playoffs by Washington . After one game of the 1987 season was lost to the players strike , the NFL employed substitutes , most of which were given derogatory nicknames ( in this case the Los Angeles Shams ) . After a 2\u20131 record , the Rams regulars returned , but the team only went 6\u20139 and did not qualify for the postseason .",
      "The Rams managed to return in 1988 with a 10\u20136 record , but then were defeated by Minnesota in the wild card round . Los Angeles won the first five games of 1989 , including a sensational defeat of the defending champion 49ers . They beat the Eagles in the wild card game , then beat the Giants in overtime before suffering a 30\u20133 flogging at the hands of the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game .",
      "Although it was not apparent at the time , the 1989 NFC Championship Game was the end of an era . The Rams did not have another winning season for the rest of their first tenure in Los Angeles before relocating to St . Louis . They crumbled to 5\u201311 in 1990 , followed by a 3\u201313 season in 1991 .",
      "1992\u20131994 : Exit from Southern California .",
      "Robinson was fired at the end of the 1991 season . However , the return of Chuck Knox as head coach , after his successful stints as head coach of the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks , did not boost the Rams sagging fortunes . His run-oriented offense marked the end of the Zampese tenure in 1993 . Knoxs game plans called for an offense that was steady , if unspectacular . Unfortunately for the Rams , Knoxs offense was not only aesthetically unpleasing but dull as well , especially by 1990s standards . The Rams finished last in the NFC West during all three years of Knoxs second stint , and were never serious contenders during this time .",
      "As the losses piled up and the team was seen as playing uninspired football , the Rams already dwindling fan base was reduced even further . By 1994 , support for the Rams had withered to the point where they were barely part of the Los Angeles sports landscape . With sellouts becoming fewer and far between , the Rams saw more of their games blacked out in Southern California . One of the few bright spots during this time was Jerome Bettis , a bruising running back from Notre Dame . Bettis flourished in Knoxs offense , running for 1,429 yards as a rookie , and 1,025 in his sophomore effort .",
      "As had become increasingly common with sports franchises , the Rams began to blame much of their misfortune on their stadium situation . With Orange County mired in a deep recession resulting largely from defense sector layoffs , the Rams were unable to secure a new or improved stadium in the Los Angeles area , which ultimately cast their future in Southern California into doubt .",
      "By 1995 , the Rams franchise had withered to a shadow of its former self . Accusations and excuses were constantly thrown back and forth between the Rams fan base , ownership , and local politicians . Many in the fan base blamed the ownership of Georgia Frontiere for the franchises woes , while ownership cited the outdated stadium and withering fan support .",
      "Frontiere finally gave up and decided to move the Rams franchise to St . Louis . However , on March 15 , 1995 , the other league owners rejected her bid to move the franchise by a 21\u20133\u20136 vote . Commissioner Paul Tagliabue stated after rejecting the move , This was one of the most complex issues we have had to approach in years . We had to balance the interest of fans in Los Angeles and in St . Louis that we appreciate very much . In my judgment , they did not meet the guidelines we have in place for such a move . The commissioner also added : Once the bridges have been burned and people get turned off on a sports franchise , years of loyalty is not respected and it is difficult to get it back . By the same token , there are millions of fans in that area who have supported the Rams in an extraordinary way . The Rams have 50 years of history and the last 5 or so years of difficult times can be corrected .",
      "However , Frontiere responded with a thinly veiled threat at a lawsuit . The owners eventually acquiesced to her demands , wary of going through a long , protracted legal battle . Tagliabue simply stated that The desire to have peace and not be at war was a big factor in allowing the Rams move to go forward . In a matter of a month , the vote had gone from 21\u20136 opposed to 23\u20136 in favor , with the Raiders , who left the Coliseum and returned to Oakland later in 1995 , abstaining . Jonathan Kraft , son of Patriots owner Robert Kraft , elaborated on the commissioners remarks by saying that about five or six owners didnt want to get the other owners into litigation , so they switched their votes . Only six franchises remained in opposition to the Rams move from Los Angeles : the Pittsburgh Steelers , New York Giants , New York Jets , Buffalo Bills , Arizona Cardinals ( who played in St . Louis from 1960 to 1987 ) , and Washington Redskins . After the vote was over , Dan Rooney publicly stated that he opposed the move of the Los Angeles Rams because I believe we should support the fans who have supported us for years .",

      "The 1995 and 1996 seasons , the Rams first two in St . Louis , were under the direction of former Oregon Ducks head coach Rich Brooks . Their most prolific player from their first two seasons was the fan favorite Isaac Bruce . Then in 1997 , Dick Vermeil was hired as the head coach . That same year , the Rams traded up in the 1997 NFL draft to select future All-Pro offensive tackle , Orlando Pace .",

      "The 1999 season started with quarterback Trent Green injuring his leg in preseason play , which left him sidelined for the entire season ; the starting job fell to backup Kurt Warner , who came out of college as an undrafted free agent and whose career had included stints with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe . Vermeil told the public that the Rams would Rally around Kurt Warner , and play good football . Warner synced up with Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce to lead the Rams to one of the most prolific offenses in history , posting 526 points for the season . This was the beginning of what later became known as The Greatest Show on Turf . Warner shocked the league by throwing for 41 touchdowns . This led the Rams to Super Bowl XXXIV , where they beat the Tennessee Titans , 23\u201316 . Warner was named the Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl . Following the Rams win , Vermeil retired , and Vermeils offensive coordinator Mike Martz was hired as head coach . He managed to take the Rams to Super Bowl XXXVI , where the team lost to the New England Patriots 20\u201317 . Martz helped the Rams establish a pass-first identity that posted an NFL record number of points over the course of three seasons ( 1999\u20132001 ) . However , in the first round in the 2004 draft , the Rams chose Oregon State running back Steven Jackson as the 24th pick of the draft .",

      "Although the Rams were one of the most productive teams in NFL history at the time , head coach Martz was criticized by many as careless with game management . He often feuded with several players as well as team president and general manager , Jay Zygmunt . However , most of his players respected him and went on record saying that they enjoyed him as a coach . In 2005 , Martz was ill , and was hospitalized for several games , allowing assistant head coach Joe Vitt to coach the remainder of the season . Although Martz was cleared later in the season , team president John Shaw did not allow him to come back to coach the team . After the Rams fired Martz , former Minnesota offensive coordinator Scott Linehan took control of an 8\u20138 team in 2006 . In 2007 , Linehan led the Rams to a 3\u201313 record .",

Ownership of the team passed to her son Dale Chip Rosenbloom and daughter Lucia Rodriguez . Chip Rosenbloom was named the new Rams majority owner . Linehan was already faced with scrutiny from several players in the locker room , including Torry Holt and Steven Jackson . Linehan was then fired on September 29 , 2008 , after the team started the season 0\u20134 . Jim Haslett , defensive coordinator under Linehan , was interim head coach for the rest of the 2008 season .",

      "On January 17 , 2009 , Steve Spagnuolo was named the new head coach of the franchise . In his previous post as defensive coordinator with the New York Giants , Spagnuolo masterminded a defensive scheme that shut down the potent offense of the previously undefeated and untied New England Patriots , the odds on favorite to win the Super Bowl that year . In one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history , the New York Giants defeated the Patriots 17\u201314 . In spite of his success as defensive coordinator with the Giants , Spagnuolos first season as head coach of the Rams was disappointing as the team won only once in 16 attempts .",
      "On May 31 , 2009 , the St . Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the majority owners Rosenbloom and Rodriguez officially offered their majority share of Rams for sale . They retained the services of Goldman Sachs , a prominent investment banking firm , to help facilitate the sale of the Rams by evaluating bids and soliciting potential buyers . The sale price was unknown , but at the time Forbes magazines most recent estimate listed the Rams value at $929 million . On the final day to do so , then-minority owner Stan Kroenke invoked his right of first refusal to buy the 60% of the team that he did not already own . The original intended buyer , Shahid Khan , later acquired the Jacksonville Jaguars after the 2011 season . Pursuant to NFL rules , owners are prohibited from owning other sports teams in markets where there is already an NFL team . At the time of purchase , Kroenke ( d/b/a Kroenke Sports Enterprises ) owned the Denver Nuggets , the Colorado Avalanche , the Colorado Rapids , and the Pepsi Center ( home to the Nuggets and the Avalanche ) . Kroenke , a real estate and sports mogul married to a Walmart heir , also owned Altitude Sports and Entertainment . These interests violated the NFLs cross-ownership rule . Nevertheless , on August 25 , 2010 , NFL owners unanimously approved him as the owner of the franchise contingent upon his eventual divestment of his Colorado sports interests . Kroenke complied with the rule when he transferred ownership of the Nuggets , Avalanche , the Pepsi Center , and the Altitude to his son Josh Kroenke .",

The Rams were free to break the lease and either relocate without penalty or continue to lease the dome on a year-to-year basis . In May 2012 , the dome was ranked by Time magazine as the 7th worst major sports stadium in the United States . In a 2008 Sports Illustrated poll , St .

At this time , the Rams began negotiations with St . Louis about what steps could be taken to remediate the top tier requirement of the lease .",

In his final years , Kroenke was referred to Silent Stan as he refused to speak about the team and the potential move . In a last-ditch effort , St . Louis came up with a viable stadium plan to keep the team , but the NFL and the Rams position was that the Rams followed the agreed-upon remediation process laid out in the Edward Jones Dome lease , and that St . Louis hastily put together plan shifted too much of the stadium cost to the Rams franchise . Ultimately , the other NFL teams owners voted to allow the Rams to relocate to Los Angeles .",

The game featured a controversial ending : on a third-down play inside the final two minutes with the score tied at 20 , Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman made contact with Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis well before a pass from Saints quarterback Drew Brees had arrived . Additionally , Robey-Coleman delivered a helmet-to-helmet hit ; however , no flag was thrown for pass interference or the illegal hit , leading to outrage from Saints players and fans as this denied New Orleans a first down , which would have likely put the game out of reach .

      "Gurley , who had suffered a quad injury against Seattle , would miss the Rams Week 6 bout with the 49ers , in addition to Matthews and other key members of the Rams offensive line . The depleted Rams lost 20-7 , a game in which Goff was held to a career-low 78 yards passing and took four sacks . Two days after the loss , cornerback Marcus Peters was traded to the Baltimore Ravens in exchange for linebacker Kenny Young . Los Angeles then traded two first-round picks and a fourth-round pick to the Jacksonville Jaguars in exchange for cornerback Jalen Ramsey , who contributed well despite playing on a snap count in the Rams 37-10 victory over the Falcons . The Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 24-10 in London before dropping a low-scoring battle with the Pittsburgh Steelers 17-12 . Between the games against the Bengals and Steelers , Aqib Talib , who was on injured reserve , was traded to the Miami Dolphins . Throughout the season , the Rams offensive line had taken multiple injuries , which led to second-string players such as Bobby Evans and David Edwards getting significant playing time in the latter half of the year . The Rams , who were also missing wide receiver Robert Woods for a week , defeated the Bears 17-7 at home before being dismantled by the Ravens 45-6 , with Baltimore scoring touchdowns on their first six drives while Goff and Gurley , the latter of whom had been significantly limited throughout the season , continued to struggle . Los Angeles responded with a 34-7 rout over the Cardinals , where rookie safety Taylor Rapp notched his first career interception , which he returned for a touchdown , while Goff threw his first passing touchdown in a month after going all of November without a single one . The team then turned in one of their strongest first-half performances of the year in a 28-12 victory over the Seahawks , in what was the final primetime NFL game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . The Rams , however , were unable to keep their momentum in a 21-44 loss to the Dallas Cowboys , dealing the team a devastating blow to their playoff chances and forcing them into a must-win game against the 49ers . The Rams led late in the game , but the 49ers won the wild affair 34-31 via a field goal after a miscommunication between Ramsey and Rapp on the final drive of the game led to a blown coverage , which put San Francisco in scoring position .

      "2020 : The SoFi Stadium Era Begins .",
      "Like the rest of the NFL , the Rams were forced to navigate a difficult offseason when the global COVID-19 pandemic struck , meaning offseason free-agent visits , college player visits , the Draft , and other team activities would be conducted virtually , and there would be no preseason held . In free agency , the Rams chose to release Todd Gurley after his lackluster 2019 , where he finished with career-lows in touchdowns and rushing yards after being significantly limited by his knee injury . The Rams also released Brandin Cooks , who , due to recurring concussion issues , missed multiple games the previous year . The team filled those holes by drafting running back Cam Akers and receiver Van Jefferson . However , the Rams would lose Cory Littleton and Dante Fowler in free agency , and were set to lose Michael Brockers to the Ravens until a failed physical allowed him to return to Los Angeles on a 3-year deal . Kicker Greg Zuerlein would also depart , signing with the Cowboys , and he was replaced by rookie Sam Sloman . One week before the start of the season , Jalen Ramsey was signed to a 5-year , $102 million deal , making him the highest-paid cornerback in league history .",

At a cost of over $5 billion , SoFi Stadium is the most expensive stadium in the world , and hosts a seating capacity of approximately 70,000 . Unfortunately , the ongoing pandemic made it impossible for the Rams to host any fans during their inaugural campaign at their new home . The team , which had also undergone a rebranding of logos , colors and uniforms , won their first game of the 2020 season by a score of 20-17 over the Cowboys , a game which featured a controversial ending , in which Dallas receiver Michael Gallup was flagged for offensive pass interference against Ramsey , which denied Dallas a large gain that wouldve been enough to put them in scoring position . Many argued that Ramsey sold it and was not completely interfered with making a play on the ball . The Rams would win their Week 2 game with a 37-19 rout over the Philadelphia Eagles , where Jared Goff , who appeared to have shrugged off last years struggles , completed his first 14 consecutive passes and threw for three touchdowns , all to tight end Tyler Higbee . The Rams then took part in a close battle with the Buffalo Bills , who led 28-3 before the Rams nearly pulled off the biggest comeback win in team history , but lost 35-32 on a controversial pass interference call against Darious Williams . Williams , however , would respond by snagging a game-winning interception in a surprisingly low-scoring battle against the Giants , with a final score of 17-9 .",
      "After a 30-10 win over the Washington Football Team in Week 5 , the Rams would struggle in a 24-16 loss to a depleted San Francisco 49ers team . The defense stole the show in a bounce-back 24-10 win over the Bears in primetime , but the team then suffered an ugly 28-17 loss to the Dolphins . Despite Los Angeles shutting out Miami in the second half , Jared Goff struggled heavily against Miamis defense , only completed 35 of his 61 pass attempts while throwing two interceptions and losing two fumbles . After the bye week , Darious Williams would continue to impress , securing two interceptions in the Rams 23-16 win over the Seahawks in Week 10 . The Rams would then enter a crucial Monday battle against the Buccaneers , who were bolstered by the acquisition of Tom Brady in the offseason . Brady , however , struggled against the Los Angeles defense , as rookie safety Jordan Fuller picked off Brady twice , while Goff turned in a solid performance with just under 400 yards passing and 3 touchdowns , two of which were the first career touchdowns for Akers and Jefferson . Kicker Matt Gay also made his Rams debut . However , Goff went right back to struggling in a 23-20 loss to the 49ers , a game that saw the defense play incredibly strong , but poor decisions and throws from Goff never extended the Rams lead in time to prevent a comeback . The following week , both the offense and defense shined in a 38-28 victory over Arizona , and in a highly-anticipated rematch of Super Bowl LIII , the Rams dismantled the Patriots 24-3 . However , in Week 15 , in the biggest upset of the year , the Rams shockingly gave the 0-13 New York Jets their first win of the season , 23-20 . Los Angeles went down by 13 points before scoring , and crucial mistakes from Goff as well as strong performances from the Jets defense put the game too far out of reach for the Rams offense . At this point in the season , many had suggested that the Rams needed to replace the turnover-prone Goff at quarterback , and calling the otherwise stellar team a quarterback away from being a legitimate Super Bowl contender . Goff , however , broke his thumb late in a 20-9 loss to Seattle , and in their season finale against the Cardinals , John Wolford made his first career start after Goff had surgery on his throwing hand . Despite not passing for any touchdowns , Wolford played strong , as did the Los Angeles defense , and the Rams took down the Cardinals 18-7 , while the Green Bay Packers victory over the Chicago Bears clinched the Rams a playoff berth .",
      "Wolford was given the start over Goff in the Rams Wild Card round game against the Seahawks , though early on in the game , a rough hit by Seahawks safety Jamal Adams took Wolford out of the game with a neck injury . Goff , who was playing with a bandaged throwing thumb , came into the game and helped to steady the Rams offense while the defense took over the rest of the game , and the Rams eliminated their rivals with a 30-20 win . However , Rams superstar defender Aaron Donald missed most of the second half with a rib injury , and the next week , with Wolford declared out due to his neck injury , Goff had to step in again in the Divisional round against a heavily favored Packers team . Goff played a more solid game , but Donald , who was apparently limited by his injury , was a non-factor in the game , and the Packers mistake-free offense was too much for the Rams to overcome . Green Bay won 32-18 to advance to the NFC Championship .",
      "2021 : Matthew Stafford Arrives .",
      "Before Super Bowl LV had even been played , the Rams agreed to a blockbuster trade , as they dealt an inconsistently performing Jared Goff to the Detroit Lions in exchange for Detroits own quarterback , Matthew Stafford . Acquiring Stafford came at a steep price , as Los Angeles gave up a 2021 third-round pick and two first-round picks in 2022 and 2023 .",
      "Team value .",
      "Forbes magazine estimated the worth of the team in 2015 as $1.45 billion , which at the time were the 28th most valuable NFL team and 44th most valuable sports team in the world . However , after relocating back to Los Angeles , it was reported by CBS Sports that the Rams value shot up to $2.9 billion ( doubling in value ) placing them third in the NFL ( only behind the Dallas Cowboys and the New England Patriots ) .",
      "On September 15 , 2016 , Forbes released their 2016 The Business of Football valuations list the Los Angeles Rams value was $2.9 billion making the team the sixth most valuable team in the NFL . In September 2019 , Forbes released their annual NFL team value , the Rams were ranked 4th on the list most valuable teams in the National Football League ( team valued at $3.8 billion ) , behind to the Dallas Cowboys , New England Patriots , and the New York Giants , respectively .",
      "Logos and uniforms .",
      "The Rams were the first NFL team to have a logo on their helmets . Ever since halfback Fred Gehrke , who worked as a commercial artist in off-seasons , painted ram horns on the teams leather helmets in 1948 , the logo has been the clubs trademark .",
      "When the team debuted in 1937 , the Rams colors were red and black , featuring red helmets , black uniforms with red shoulders and sleeves , tan pants , and red socks with black and white stripes . One year later they switched their team colors to gold and royal blue , with gold helmets , white pants , royal blue uniforms with gold numbers and gold shoulders , white pants with a royal stripe , and solid royal blue socks . By the mid-1940s the Rams had adopted gold jerseys ( with navy blue serif numerals , navy blue shoulders , gold helmets , white pants with a gold-navy-gold stripe , and gold socks with two navy stripes ) . The uniforms were unchanged as the team moved to Los Angeles .",
      "The helmets were changed to navy in 1947 . When Gehrke introduced the horns , they were painted yellow-gold on navy blue helmets . In 1949 the team adopted plastic helmets , and the Rams horns were rendered by the Riddell company of Des Plaines , Illinois , which baked a painted design into the helmet at its factory . Also in 1949 the serif jersey numerals gave way to more standard block numbers . Wider , bolder horns joined at the helmet center front and curving around the earhole appeared in 1950 ; this design was somewhat tapered in 1954\u20131955 . Also in 1950 a blue-gold-blue tri-stripe appeared on the pants and Northwestern University-style royal blue stripes were added to jersey sleeves . A white border was added to the blue jersey numerals in 1953 . So-called TV numbers were added on jersey sleeves in 1956 .",
      "In accordance with a 1957 NFL rule dictating that the home team wear dark , primary-colored jerseys and the road team light shirts , the Rams hurriedly readied for the regular season new royal-blue home jerseys with golden striping and golden front and back numerals with a white border . The white border was removed in 1958 . The Rams continued to wear their golden jerseys for 1957 road games , but the following year adopted a white jersey with blue numerals and stripes . In 1962\u20131963 the teams road white jersey featured a UCLA-style blue-gold-blue crescent shoulder tri-stripe .",
      "In 1964 , concurrent with a major remodeling of the teams Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum home , the colors were changed to a simpler blue and white . The new helmet horns were white , wider , and separated at the helmet center front . The blue jersey had white numerals with two white sleeve stripes . The white jersey featured blue numerals and a wide blue crescent shoulder stripe . A 1964 league rule allowed teams to wear white jerseys for home games and the Rams were among several teams to do so ( the Dallas Cowboys , who introduced their blue-white-silverblue uniform that season , have worn white at home ever since ) , as owner Dan Reeves felt it would be more enjoyable for fans to see the various colors of the rest of the league as opposed to always having the Rams in blue and the visiting team in white . The pants were white with a thick blue stripe . In 1970 , in keeping with the standards of the newly merged NFL , names appeared on the jersey backs for the first time . The sleeve TV numbers , quite large compared to those of other teams , were made smaller in 1965 . From 1964 to early 1972 the Rams wore white jerseys for every home league game and exhibition , at one point not wearing their blue jerseys at all from the 10th game of 1967 through the 1971 opener , a stretch of 48 games ; it was a tradition that continued under coaches Harland Svare , George Allen , and Tommy Prothro . But new owner Carroll Rosenbloom did not particularly like the Rams uniforms , so in pursuit of a new look the team wore its seldom-used blue jerseys for most home games in 1972 . During that season Rosenblooms Rams also announced an intention to revive the old blue and gold colors for 1973 , and asked fans to send in design ideas .",
      "Yellow-gold was restored to the teams color scheme in 1973 . The new uniform design consisted of yellow-gold pants and curling rams horns on the sleeves\u2014yellow-gold horns curving from the shoulders to the arms on the blue jerseys , which featured golden numerals ( a white border around the numerals , similar to the 1957 style , appeared for two preseason games and then disappeared ) . Players names were in contrasting white . The white jersey had similarly shaped blue horns , numerals and names . The white jerseys also had yellow gold sleeves . The gold pants included a blue-white-blue tri-stripe , which was gradually widened through the 1970s and early 1980s . The blue socks initially featured two thin golden stripes in the middle of the blue section ; they disappeared upon their move to St . Louis in 1995 . From 1973 to 1976 the Rams were the only team to wear white cleats on the road and royal blue cleats at home ; since 1977 , they have worn white ones . The new golden helmet horns were of identical shape , but for the first time the horn was not factory-painted but instead a decal applied to the helmet . The decal was cut in sections and affixed to accommodate spaces for face-mask and chin-strap attachments , and so the horn curved farther around the ear hole . The jersey numerals were made thicker and blunter in 1975 . The Rams primarily wore blue at home with this combination , but after 1977 occasionally wore white at home . The team wore its white jerseys for most of its 1978 home dates , including its postseason games with the Minnesota Vikings and the Dallas Cowboys\u2014the latter is the only postseason game the Cowboys have ever won while outfitted in their blue jerseys . The gray face masks became navy blue in 1981 . The Rams wore white jerseys exclusively in the 1982 and 1993 seasons , as well as other selected occasions throughout their 15 seasons in Anaheim .",
      "On April 12 , 2000 , the St . Louis Rams debuted new logos , team colors , and uniforms . The Rams primary colors were changed from royal blue and yellow to Millennium Blue and New Century Gold . A new logo of a charging rams head was added to the sleeves and gold stripes were added to the sides of the jerseys . The new gold pants no longer featured any stripes . Blue pants and white pants with a small gold stripe ( an extension off the jersey stripe that ended in a point ) were also an option with the Rams electing to wear the white set in a pre-season game in San Diego in 2001 . The helmet design essentially remained the same as it was in 1948 , except for updates to the coloring , navy blue field with gold horns . The 2000 rams horn design featured a slightly wider separation at the helmets center . Both home and away jerseys had a gold stripe that ran down each side , but that only lasted for the 2000 and 2001 seasons . Additionally , the TV numbers on the jerseys , which had previously been on the sleeve , moved up to the shoulder pad .",
      "In 2003 , the Rams wore blue pants with their white jerseys for a pair of early-season games , but after losses to the New York Giants and Seattle Seahawks , the Rams reverted to gold pants with their white jerseys . In 2005 , the Rams wore the blue pants at home against Arizona and on the road against Dallas . In 2007 , the Rams wore all possible combinations of their uniforms . They wore the blue tops and gold pants at home against Carolina , San Francisco , Cleveland , Seattle , and on the road against Dallas . They wore the blue tops and blue pants at home against Arizona , Atlanta , and Pittsburgh on Marshall Faulk night . They wore the blue tops and white pants on the road in Tampa Bay and at home against Green Bay . They wore white tops and gold pants at New Orleans and San Francisco . They wore white tops and white pants at Seattle and Arizona . And they wore white tops and blue pants at Baltimore and Cincinnati . In 2008 , the Rams did away with the gold pants after they were used for only one regular-season game at Seattle . The blue jerseys with white pants and white jerseys with blue pants combinations were used most of the time . For the 2009 season , the Rams elected to wear the white pants with both jerseys for the majority of the time except the games against the Vikings and Texans ( see below ) where they wore the throwback jerseys from the 1999 season , week 2 in Washington when they wore gold pants with the blue jersey , and week 12 against Seattle when they wore blue pants with the blue jersey .",
      "During their time in St . Louis , the Rams had worn blue at home . Like most other teams playing in a dome , the Rams did not need to wear white to gain an advantage with the heat . The Rams wore their white jerseys and blue pants in St . Louis against the Dallas Cowboys , on October 19 , 2008 , forcing the Cowboys to wear their unlucky blue uniforms , and won the game 34\u201314 . On October 21 , 2012 , the Rams wore white jerseys and white pants against the Green Bay Packers .",
      "The NFL approved the use of throwback uniforms for the club during the 2009 season to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the 1999 Super Bowl championship . The Rams wore the throwback uniforms for two home games in 2009 , on October 11 against the Minnesota Vikings and on December 20 against the Houston Texans . The Rams wore their 1999 throwbacks again on October 31 , 2010 , when they beat the Carolina Panthers 20\u201310 . The throwbacks have since then seen action for two select regular-season games each year since . In 1994 , the teams last season in Southern California , the Rams wore jerseys and pants replicating those of their 1951 championship season for their September games with the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs .",
      "Four days after the NFL approved their return to Los Angeles , the team made slight changes to its branding . The only change to the teams wordmark logo was the location name , from St . Louis to Los Angeles , to reflect the teams move . The teams colors were retained . The Rams also announced there would be no significant changes to the teams uniforms , apart from the newly updated logos with the Los Angeles location name .",
      "In a March 21 , 2016 , interview with the Los Angeles Times , team chief operating officer Kevin Demoff said that there would be no uniform change for the team until 2019 ( the year that the new stadium was originally planned to open ) . However , the stadium completion was pushed back one year into 2020 in May 2017 , pushing the rebrand back to 2020 along with it . On August 11 , 2016 , the team announced on Twitter that it would wear its all-white uniforms for five of the teams eight home games during the 2016 season as a nod to the Fearsome Foursome era ; the Rams wore their alternative royal blue and gold throwback uniforms for the other two games at the Coliseum and wore their midnight blue jerseys at their international game at Twickenham Stadium .",
      "Throughout the 2016 season , the Rams signage around the stadium , end zones , and other uses of the logo showed a variation that was only colored in blue and white , leading some fans to believe the teams upcoming rebrand would involve gold being completely dropped from the color scheme . For the 2017 season , the Rams announced they would be wearing helmets similar to the Fearsome Foursome era : Millennium blue helmets with white helmet horns and , voted on by fans , a white face mask . Fans also voted for a new pants design , which was a single blue stripe down the side of white pants , as well as an inverse design for road games . The team also began using the blue and white logo as their primary logo , confirming that they would be phasing out gold from their color scheme , although gold remained on the jerseys due to an NFL rule that teams must have the same jersey design for at least a minimum of five seasons . The Rams also announced a fan vote via Twitter to decide which two home games they would wear throwback uniforms . Fans selected the October 8 , 2017 , game against the Seahawks and the December 31 , 2017 , game against the 49ers , the same two opponents the Rams wore throwbacks against the prior season . In their Week 3 road game against the 49ers , the Rams also participated in NFL Color Rush , wearing throwback-style all-yellow uniforms with blue detailing and blue numbers , as well as yellow horns on the helmets and white stripes outlined in blue on the pants .",
      "The Rams announced on July 27 , 2018 , that they would wear their throwback royal blue and yellow primary color uniform for home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the 2018 season . In conjunction with the change , the team retired its navy blue and metallic gold uniform . The Rams white uniform remained unchanged , and its one alternate uniform is the yellow Color Rush uniform . Additionally , the team confirmed their new rebrand would take place in 2020 to coincide with the opening of their new home stadium , SoFi Stadium .",
      "On March 23 , 2020 , the Rams officially unveiled a new logo set and color scheme . The new primary logo features stylized LA lettering with a rams horn forming and spiraling out of the top of the A , with gradients to show curvature similar to a real rams horn . A website showcasing the new look says the letters were included ensuring that the Rams are forever tied to the city of Los Angeles . The secondary logo is a rams head that combines several elements from previous logos of the team . New wordmarks were introduced as well , and the teams new colors were revealed as Rams Royal ( royal blue ) and Sol ( yellow ) . Despite the optimism of the Rams design team ; the logo was very poorly received by a majority of the fanbase . COO Kevin Demoff stated that the two key elements the team kept in mind were the horns , which had long been symbolic of the team , and the royal blue and yellow color scheme . Demoff stated that the team had studied every single previous look for inspiration , and the goal was to weave together this history into a new , modern look...respecting our past and representing our future .",
      "The Rams officially revealed the clubs new uniform designs on May 13 , 2020 . The team introduced three combinations , two of which included a royal blue jersey with yellow and white gradient numbers , as well as yellow sleeve striping similar to the new shape of the horns . Blue pants with similar gradient stripes were introduced , alongside yellow pants with solid white and blue stripes . The road jersey was given a new bone grey color , which featured white and yellow sleeve patterns and blue numbers . Bone grey pants were featured alongside the road jersey , which included a white stripe with a thinner yellow stripe . All three combinations used a brand new metallic blue helmet design , featuring blue facemasks and the new styling of the horns similar to the teams logos .",

      "Radio and television .",
      "The Rams were the first NFL team to televise their home games ; in a sponsorship arrangement with Admiral television , all home games of the 1950 NFL season were shown locally . The Rams also televised games in the early 1950s . The 1951 NFL Championship Game was the first championship game televised coast-to-coast ( via the DuMont Network ) . During the teams original stint in Los Angeles all games were broadcast on KMPC radio ( 710 AM ) ; play-by-play announcers were Bob Kelley ( who accompanied the team from Cleveland and worked until his death in 1966 ) , Dick Enberg ( 1966\u20131977 ) , Al Wisk ( 1978\u20131979 ) , Bob Starr ( 1980\u20131989 , 1993 ) , Eddie Doucette ( 1990 ) , Paul Olden ( 1991\u20131992 ) , and Steve Physioc ( 1994 ) .

      "During the teams stint in St . Louis it had a few broadcast partners . From 1995 to 1999 the Rams games were broadcast on KSD 93.7 FM . From 2000 to 2008 KLOU FM 103.3 was the Rams flagship station with Steve Savard as the play-by-play announcer . Until October 2005 , Jack Snow had been the color analyst since 1992 , dating back to the teams original stint in Los Angeles . Snow left the booth after suffering an illness and died in January 2006 . Former Rams offensive line coach Jim Hanifan joined KLOU as the color analyst the year after Jack Snows departure . From 2009 until 2015 , the Rams flagship radio station was 101.1 FM WXOS , a sports station in St . Louis affiliated with ESPN Radio . Savard served as the play-by-play man with DMarco Farr in the color spot and Brian Stull reporting from the field . Preseason games not shown on a national broadcast network were seen on KTVI in St . Louis ; preseason games are produced by the Kroenke-owned Denver-based Altitude Sports and Entertainment , which shares common ownership with the Rams .",
      "Months after the Rams returned to Los Angeles , it was announced on June 9 , 2016 , that their anchor station would be CBS O&O station KCBS-TV will air pre-season games that are not on national television . The KCBS broadcasting team includes Andrew Siciliano ( play-by-play announcer ) , Pro Football Hall of Fame former running backs Eric Dickerson and Marshall Faulk providing color commentary . In 2017 NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah replaced Dickerson . KCBSs Jill Arrington and Rams reporters Dani Klupenger and Myles Simmons also provide insight ; a pre-game show airs a half-hour before each game in addition former Rams quarterback Jim Everett and former defensive back and sports anchor/director Jim Hill provides an inside look into each upcoming game with player profiles , live interviews from booth and sideline updates and a 30-minute postgame that provides game breakdown , film analysis , and press conference look-ins with head coach Sean McVay and select players . Spanish-language game coverage is provided by Spanish-language sister stations Univision 34 ( one home game ) and UniM\u00e1s 46 ( two away games ) in Spanish . In 2016 , the Rams news and highlights where shown on Rams Primetime Live on KABC-TV on Saturday nights after college football games during the regular season , hosted by sports anchor Rob Fukuzaki , sports reporter Ashley Brewer and traffic reporter Alysha Del Valle .",
      "Under the leagues current national TV contracts for regular-season games , Fox O&O KTTV carries the bulk of the teams games due to Fox holding the rights to the NFC contract , along with Thursday Night Football . KCBS carries Sunday afternoon games in which the Rams host an AFC team ( pending any Rams Sunday game that the league later decides in mid-season to cross-flex between Fox and CBS ) . KNBC airs NBC Sunday Night Football and some selected Thursday night games produced by NBC . As for games that air on ESPNs Monday Night Football , KABC simulcasts these cable games carries those games as the two channels share common ownership . The leagues blackout policy is not currently in effect , meaning that besides road games , all Rams home games are televised in the Los Angeles market , regardless of attendance . If the Chargers and Rams are both playing at the same time on Sunday afternoons on a certain network ( for instance , a Rams road game against an AFC opponent at the same time as a Charger home game with an NFC opponent with both on Fox , or the reverse where the Rams are on the road against an AFC opponent and the Chargers are at home against an AFC opponent on CBS ) , in the Los Angeles market , Fox and CBS have authorization to carry the additional game on their secondary sister stations ; Fox games air on KCOP-TV , while CBS games are aired on KCAL-TV .",
      "On June 20 , 2016 , the Rams announced their Los Angeles-area radio broadcasting rights agreements . As of 2016 , the Rams official flagship radio station is KSPN-AM , while the teams official FM radio station is KCBS-FM ( owned by Entercom ) . On July 19 , 2016 , the Rams announced that they had reached an agreement with KWKW for Spanish-language coverage of the team . The Rams radio English broadcast team is J.B . Long ( play-by-play voice announcer ) , Maurice Jones-Drew ( color analyst ) , and DMarco Farr ( sideline reporter ) with Mario Solis and Troy Santiago comprising the Spanish broadcast team . ESPN 710 also broadcasts a three-hour pre-game broadcast show featuring Steve Mason , Kirk Morrison ( former NFL linebacker ) and Eric Davis as well as a two-hour post-game show with Travis Rodgers , Morrison , and Davis , Jeff Biggs will cover the Rams during halftime .",

      "The Particle and Astrophysical Xenon Detector , or PandaX , is a dark matter detection experiment at China Jinping Underground Laboratory ( CJPL ) in Sichuan , China . The experiment occupies the deepest underground laboratory in the world , and is among the largest of its kind .",
      "Participants .",
      "The experiment is run by an international team of about 40 scientists , led by researchers at Chinas Shanghai Jiao Tong University . The project began in 2009 with researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shandong University , the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics , and the Chinese Academy of Sciences . Researchers from the University of Maryland , Peking University , and the University of Michigan joined two years later . The PandaX team also includes members from the Ertan Hydropower Development Company . Scientists from University of Science and Technology of China , China Institute of Atomic Energy and Sun Yat-Sen University joined PandaX in 2015 .",
      "Design and construction .",
      "PandaX is a direct-detection experiment , consisting of a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber ( TPC ) detector . The use of both liquid and gaseous phases of xenon , similarly to the XENON and LUX experiments , allows the location of events to be determined , and gamma ray events to be vetoed . In addition to searching for dark matter events , PandaX is designed to detect Xe-136 neutrinoless double beta decay .",
      "Laboratory .",
      "PandaX is located at China Jinping Underground Laboratory ( CJPL ) , the deepest underground laboratory in the world at more than below ground . The depth of the laboratory means the experiment is better shielded from cosmic ray interference than similar detectors , allowing the instrument to be scaled up more easily . The muon flux at CJPL is 66 events per square meter per year , compared with 950 events/m/year at the Sanford Underground Research Facility , home of the LUX experiment , and 8,030 events/m/year at the Gran Sasso lab in Italy , home to the XENON detector . The marble at Jinping is also less radioactive than the rock at Homestake and Gran Sasso , further reducing the frequency of false detections . Wolfgang Lorenzon , a collaborating researcher from the University of Michigan , has commented that the big advantage is that PandaX is much cheaper and doesnt need as much shielding material as similar detectors .",
      "Operational stages .",
      "Like most low-background physics , the experiment is constructing multiple generations of detectors , each serving as a prototype for the next . A larger size allows greater sensitivity , but this is only useful if unwanted background events can be kept from swamping the desired ones ; ever more stringent limits on radioactive contamination are also required . Lessons learned in earlier generations are used to construct later ones .",
      "The first generation , PandaX-I , operated until late November , 2014 . It used of xenon ( of which served as a fiducial mass ) to probe the low-mass regime ( <10 GeV ) and verify dark matter signals reported by other detector experiments . PandaX-I was the first dark matter experiment in China to use more than 100 kg of xenon in its detector , and its size was second only to the LUX experiment in the United States .",
      "PandaX-II , completed in March 2015 and currently operational , uses of xenon ( approximately 300 kg fiducual ) to probe the 10\u20131,000 GeV regime . The PandaX-II reuses the shield , outer vessel , cryogenics , purification hardware , and general infrastructure from the first version , but uses a much larger time projection chamber , inner vessel of higher purity ( much less radioactive Co ) stainless steel , and cryostat",
      "The construction cost of PandaX is estimated at US$15 million , with an initial cost of $8 million for the first stage .",
      "PandaX-II produced some preliminary physics results from a brief commissioning run in late 2015 ( November 21 to December 14 ) before the main physics run currently underway through 2018 .",
      "PandaX-II is significantly more sensitive than both the 100-kg XENON100 and 250-kg LUX detectors . XENON100 , in Italy has , in the three to four years prior to 2014 , produced the highest sensitivities over a wide range of WIMP masses , but was leapfrogged by PandaX-II . The most recent results on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section of PandaX-II were published in 2017 . In September 2018 the XENON1T experiment published its results from 278.8 days of collected data and set a new record limit for WIMP-nucleon spin-independent elastic interactions .",
      "The next stages of PandaX are called PandaX-xT . An intermediate stage with a four-ton target ( PandaX-4T ) is under construction in the second-phase CJPL-II laboratory . The ultimate goal is to build a third generation dark matter detector , which will contain thirty tons of xenon in the sensitive region .",
      "Initial results .",
      "The majority of the PandaX experimental equipment was transported from Shanghai Jiao Tong University to China Jinping Underground Laboratory in August 2012 , and two engineering test runs were conducted in 2013 . The initial data-collection run ( PandaX-I ) began in May 2014 . Results from this run were reported in September 2014 in the journal Science China Physics , Mechanics & Astronomy . In the initial run , about 4 million raw events were recorded , with around 10,000 in the expected energy region for WIMP dark matter . Of these , only 46 events were recorded in the quiet inner core of the xenon target . These events were consistent with background radiation , rather than dark matter . The lack of an observed dark-matter signal in the PandaX-I run places strong constraints on previously-reported dark matter signals from similar experiments .",
      "Reception .",
      "Stefan Funk of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory has questioned the wisdom of having many separate direct-detection dark matter experiments in different countries , commenting that spending all our money on different direct-detection experiments is not worth it . Xiangdong Ji , spokesperson for PandaX and a physicist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University , concedes that the international community is unlikely to support more than two multi-tonne detectors , but argues that having many groups working will lead to faster improvement in detection technology . Richard Gaitskell , a spokesperson for the LUX experiment and a physics professor at Brown University , commented , Im excited about seeing China developing a fundamental physics program ."

      "Air Berlin",
      "Air Berlin PLC & Co . Luftverkehrs KG ( ) , branded as airberlin or airberlin.com was a major German airline . At its peak , it was Germanys second-largest airline , as well as Europes tenth-largest airline in terms of passengers carried . It was headquartered in Berlin and had hubs at Berlin Tegel Airport and D\u00fcsseldorf Airport . It was a member of the oneworld airline alliance .",
      "The airline was founded in 1978 by Lelco , an American company . Following German reunification , Air Berlin was sold and became a German company in 1991 . It joined the Oneworld alliance in 2012 . After years of losses , Air Berlin filed for insolvency on 15 August 2017 and ceased operations on 27 October 2017 .",
      "History .",
      "1978\u20131990 : American charter airline in West Berlin .",
      "Originally registered as Air Berlin USA , the company was founded in 1978 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lelco , an American agricultural enterprise headquartered in Oregon , to operate charter flights on behalf of German tour operators from Berlin Tegel Airport , mostly to Mediterranean holiday resorts .",
      "The co-founders of Air Berlin USA were :",
      "- Kim Lundgren , a former Berlin-based flight engineer of Pan American World Airways ;",
      "- John MacDonald , a former station manager of United States supplemental and charter airline Saturn Airways at Berlin Tempelhof Airport in the 1960s and subsequent general manager Europe and vice president at the Berlin Tegel Airport base of the former United States supplemental carrier and charter airline Modern Air from 1968 until 1974 ;",
      "- Mort Beyer , Modern Airs executive vice president from 1967 until 1971 as well as the airlines president and vice president of the National Air Carrier Association in 1971 and founder of United States aviation consultancy Avmark .",
      "Lelco was the agriculture business of Kim Lundgrens family in the United States .",
      "As a United States airline , Air Berlin was able to access the West Berlin airline market . During the Cold War , Berlins special political status meant that the air corridors into and out of Tegel Airport could only be used by airlines registered in France , the United Kingdom or the United States . The airlines headquarters were initially at Tegel Airport . Leonard Lundgren was the first chairman .",
      "After the company was issued an airline licence and acquired two Boeing 707 jet airliners previously owned by Trans World Airlines , Air Berlin USA commenced revenue services on 28 April 1979 with a flight from Berlin-Tegel to Palma de Mallorca . Plans were made to start long-haul flights on West Berlin-Brussels-Florida routes , in cooperation with Air Florida ( an agreement to that effect had been signed in February 1979 ) .",
      "In 1980 , two Boeing 737-200 were leased from Air Florida . In 1981 , Air Berlin USA continued its weekly scheduled Boeing 707 service on the Berlin Tegel Airport - Brussels - Orlando route ; however , by 1982 , the 707s had been phased out , and during most of the 1980s , Air Berlin USA operated only a single 737-200 or ( from 1986 ) a 737-300 . In 1990 and 1991 , two Boeing 737-400s were also placed into service .",
      "1990\u20132000 : New investors and expansion .",
      "German reunification led to significant changes to the European aviation market , and in particular in Berlin : German airlines now gained access to the city . In 1991 , Air Berlin ( which had 90 employees at the time ) was restructured as Air Berlin GmbH & Co . Luftverkehrs KG , a German-registered company , with several German investors joining Kim Lundgren , the original founder , thereby bringing the ownership in line with German foreign-control requirements . Joachim Hunold ( ) , a former sales and marketing director with LTU International , now led the company .",
      "Following an order for ten Boeing 737-800 , Air Berlin grew and by 1999 , the fleet grew to twelve aircraft . In 2001 , Air Berlin and Hapag-Lloyd Flug became the first airlines in the world to have their Boeing 737-800s fitted with blended winglets , wingtip devices that are intended to improve fuel efficiency .",
      "Air Berlin introduced scheduled flights ( which could be booked directly with the airline rather than via a tour operator ) in 1997 , initially linking a number of secondary German airports to Mallorca . By 2002 , 35 percent of Air Berlins tickets were sold directly . In the same year , the airline expanded beyond holiday destinations as low-fare flights marketed as City Shuttle to London , Barcelona , Milan and Vienna started . Besides Berlin-Tegel , these routes were opened at six German airports ( Dortmund , D\u00fcsseldorf , Hamburg , M\u00fcnster/Osnabr\u00fcck , Nuremberg , and Paderborn/Lippstadt ) that until then had not been served by one of the rising European low-cost carriers . In what later became a hallmark for Air Berlin as a semi-low cost carrier , the airline offered complimentary meals and seat reservations , in contrast to its competitors Buzz , Hapag-Lloyd Express , Ryanair and Virgin Express .",
      "2000\u20132006 : Becoming Germany\u2019s second-largest airline .",
      "In November 2001 , the delivery flight of a Boeing 737-800 fitted with winglets set a record : the aircraft with the registration code D-ABBC flew 8,345 kilometres non-stop from Seattle ( Boeing Field ) , USA to Berlin ( TXL ) , Germany in 9 hours , 10 minutes .",
      "In January 2004 , Air Berlin announced it would cooperate with Niki , a Vienna-based airline . As part of the deal , Air Berlin took a 24% stake in Niki .",
      "In 2005 , Air Berlin signed a partnership agreement with Germania . As part of the deal , Air Berlin leased some of Germanias aircraft and crew , and Germania became almost exclusively a charter airline . Plans were made for Germania to be associated with Air Berlin under a management contract . However , the contract was not signed . At the beginning of March 2008 , Germanias joint owners could not reach agreement on the takeover by Air Berlin , so Germania remained an independent airline . A joint Air Berlin/Germania subsidiary dubbed Air Z\u00fcrich and planned to be based at Zurich Airport was proposed in 2005 , but did not materialize .",
      "In 2005 the Group reorganised its corporate structure . It established Air Berlin plc ( registered in England ) into which it reversed Air Berlin GmbH & Co . Luftverkehrs KG and subsidiaries . It was suggested that the reason for the group to establish a UK-based PLC instead of a German-based AG was to avoid the need to have a supervisory board and employee representation as required by the German law of Mitbestimmung or co-determination .",
      "In 2006 , Air Berlin went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange . Originally scheduled for 5 May 2006 , the IPO was postponed to 11 May 2006 . The company said the delay was due to rises in fuel costs and other market pressures limiting investor demand . It reduced the initial share-price range from 15.0\u201317.5 euros to 11.5\u201314.5 euros . The stock opened at \u20ac12.0 , selling a total of 42.5 million shares . Of these , 19.6 million were new shares increasing capital in the company , and the remainder to repay loans extended by the original shareholders and invested in the company earlier in 2006 . After the IPO , the company claimed to have over 400 million euros in cash to fund further expansion , including aircraft purchases .",
      "In August 2006 , Air Berlin acquired German domestic airline dba . Flight operations at dba were continued as a fully owned subsidiary of Air Berlin until 14 November 2008 , when the dba brand was discontinued due to staff strikes ( dba staff were subsequently offered positions with Air Berlin ) .",
      "On 28 November 2006 , Air Berlin ordered 60 Boeing 737-800 aircraft , and 15 smaller Boeing 737-700 aircraft . The value of the 75 aircraft was 5.1 billion dollars ( based on list prices at the time. ) Delivery of the aircraft started in 2007 . All of these aircraft were equipped with blended winglets , to improve fuel efficiency .",
      "2007\u20132012 : Takeovers , expansion and new alliances .",
      "In March 2007 , Air Berlin took over German leisure airline LTU , gaining access to the long-haul market and becoming the fourth-largest airline group in Europe in terms of passenger traffic . This deal led to the introduction of Airbus A321 and Airbus A330 aircraft into Air Berlins fleet . On 1 May 2009 , the LTU brand was discontinued .",
      "On 7 July 2007 , Air Berlin announced an order for 25 Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner long-haul aircraft , with further options and purchase rights . Three additional aircraft of this type were to be leased from ILFC .",
      "On 21 August 2007 , Air Berlin acquired a 49 percent shareholding in Swiss charter airline Belair , the remainder being owned by tour operator Hotelplan . Following the deal , Belairs long-haul business was terminated , and the fleet was replaced by Airbus A320 family aircraft operating scheduled flights on behalf of Air Berlin as well as charter flights for Hotelplan .",
      "On 20 September 2007 , Air Berlin announced it intended to buy its competitor Condor in a deal that envisaged Condors owner , Thomas Cook Group , taking a 30% stake in Air Berlin . However , the rapidly increasing price of jet fuel and other considerations led to the abandonment of the deal in July 2008 .",
      "In January 2008 Air Berlin introduced a new logo and corporate design . The logo is a white oval shape on a red background ( suggesting an aircraft window ) where the letter a is a white circle and two white stylised wings . The text Air Berlin was in lower case and written as one word . Sometimes the slogan Your Airline was featured as part of the logo .",
      "In June 2008 , CEO Joachim Hunold offended Catalan language speakers , when he claimed in an article included in Air Berlins in-flight magazine that the government of the Balearic Islands was trying to impose the use of Catalan on Air Berlin flights from and to Majorca . He claimed that Air Berlin was an international airline and was not obliged to use Catalan . Hunold went on to criticise the language policy in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands , claiming that at the time many children could not speak any Spanish . The Balearic Islands President , Francesc Antich , explained that his government had simply sent a letter to encourage airlines operating in the Balearic Islands to include Catalan among the languages used for onboard announcements .",
      "On 18 June of the same year , Air Berlin announced that it would reduce its long-haul services by 13 percent and its domestic services by 10 percent to increase profitability .",
      "In September 2008 , Air Berlin confirmed merger talks with competitor TUIfly , but added it was speaking with all parties . Air Berlin had , until 2007 , been flying many code-share TUI flights . At the end of March 2009 , Air Berlin PLC and TUI Travel PLC signed a deal by which their German flight businesses were to operate a long-term strategic alliance . Originally , each company was to take a 19.9% stake in the other and the German cartel authorities were petitioned for approval . After the Bundeskartellamt expressed concerns , the cross-ownership plan was not implemented . Instead , TUI Travel PLC purchased a 9.9% stake in Air Berlin PLC using a capital increase at a subsidiary to do so .",
      "At the end of March 2009 , a strategic partnership agreement with TUI Travel was signed , with Air Berlin and its competitor TUIfly purchasing 19.9 percent of the others shares . Following the deal , Air Berlin took over all German domestic TUIfly routes , as well as those to Italy , Croatia and Austria . Also , all of Tuiflys Boeing 737-700 aircraft were added to Air Berlins fleet . TUIfly was to abandon all scheduled flights and rely exclusively on the charter business .",
      "In March 2009 , ESAS Holding A.S. , a Turkish company , bought approximately 15 per cent of the voting shares in Air Berlin .",
      "Also in 2009 , Air Berlin added Hartmut Mehdorn to the board of directors after his retirement at Deutsche Bahn .",
      "In April 2010 Air Berlin expanded its codeshare arrangements with Russias S7 Airlines . Air Berlin and S7 Airlines had cooperated since October 2008 . New services included codeshare flights via Moscow to Irkutsk , Perm and Rostov .",
      "In July 2010 , Air Berlin announced an increase in its shareholding in the Austrian airline Niki . Air Berlin indirectly acquired 25.9% of the shares in Niki from Privatstiftung Lauda ( private Lauda foundation ) and in doing so increased its shareholding in Niki from 24% to 49.9% . In connection with the increase of its shareholding , Air Berlin was to grant the private Lauda foundation a 40.5 million-euro loan . The private foundation had the options to repay the loan in three years with cash or through the transfer of the remaining 50.1% of Nikis shares .",
      "In July 2010 , it was also announced that Air Berlin would join Oneworld , the global airline alliance . In preparation for joining the alliance , Air Berlin made codeshare agreements with Finnair and American Airlines starting with the 2010/2011 winter schedule .",

      "On 1 April 2011 Air Berlin completed the integration of LTU . All Air Berlin Group technical services were consolidated in a new company called airberlin technik GmbH . It also added new routes , more frequent flights and additional long-haul flights from D\u00fcsseldorf .",
      "On 15 June 2011 , Air Berlin and British Airways reached a codeshare agreement covering some flights within Europe , starting from 5 July 2011 . The agreement applied to flights to over 40 European destinations served by the two airlines .",
      "CEO Joachim Hunold resigned from his position on 1 September 2011 and was succeeded by the former CEO of Deutsche Bahn AG , Hartmut Mehdorn , who led the company on an interim basis until January 2013 .",
      "In November 2011 Air Berlin and Pegasus Airlines ( Turkeys largest private airline ) launched Air Berlin Turkey , aiming at the charter market between Germany and Turkey . Pegasus Airlines is 16.5% owned by ESAS Holding AS . The new airline was absorbed into Pegasus Airlines on 31 March 2013 .",
      "In the third quarter of 2011 , the turnover of the company amounted to 1.4 billion euros , an increase of 11% . However , operating profit decreased by almost to 50% , around 97 million euros . As a result , a new bond to raise additional capital was issued .",

      "Anna Ter-Avetikian ( , : 10 October 1908 ( O.S. ) / 23 October 1908 ( N.S. ) \u2013 16 January 2013 ) was the first Armenian woman to become an architect . She designed numerous notable buildings throughout the country and was the recipient of several national prizes for her work .",
      "Early life .",
      "Anna Tigranovna Ter-Avetikian was born on 23 October 1908 in Yerevan , which at the time was in the Erivan Governorate of the Russian Empire . At the time that Armenia was annexed to Russia from the Ottoman Empire , her ancestors were granted a noble title from Nicholas I of Russia for providing assistance and medical supplies to General Ivan Paskevichs troops . She came from a family of architects and city developers who were noted for creating such works as the first drinking water system of Yerevan , the first hospital of the city , as well as other landmarks . Her father , Tigran Ter-Avetikian and his brother , Yervand , created the Philharmonic Hall of Yerevan , the City Council building on Shahumyan Square , and other noted works .",
      "After completing her high school studies , in 1924 , Ter-Avetikian enrolled in the Technical School of Yerevan State University ( YSU ) to study architecture . In 1926 , simultaneously with her studies , she started working for and Alexander Tamanian , noted architects who designed the master plan of the city of Yerevan and many of its buildings . Her schedule at this time was to go to school in the mornings , in the afternoon work in Buniatians workshop , and then work with Tamanian in the evenings . Ter-Avetikian graduated in 1930 and shortly thereafter , married fellow architect , , who had attended YSU and was also employed with Buniatian and Tamanian .",
      "Career .",
      "Together with her husband , Ter-Avetikian designed the fire and police stations in Yerevan and the Sasuntsi Tavit cinema , though the cinema was later destroyed . In 1938 , one of her designs won recognition at the Parisian international exhibit of Woman in art and folk art and that same year , received the designation Laureate of the All-Union Review of the Technical Creativity of Women Architects ( ) . Between 1941 and 1943 , she served as the Chair of the Armenian Union of Architects . Her design for the filmmakers building won the first prize in the 1948 All-Soviet Female Architects Competition . The building , often known as Ponchikanots building , because it housed one of Yerevans first caf\u00e9s , which served , a kind of pastry .",
      "Throughout her career , Ter-Avetikian , who later went to work with another design firm , built residential and office buildings , as well as schools and hospitals . Among some of her designs are the Armenfilm film studio on the corner of Lenin Avenue and Kirov Streets in Yerevan ; the Ministry of Trade building ; the NKVD building at Abovyan and Kirov Streets in Yerevan ; the R . Acharyan Institute of Language in Yerevan ; schools in Echmiadzin , Kirovakan , Leninakan , Stepanavan , and Yerevan ; a hospital in Nor Bayazet . Her designs were known for their classic composition and decorative elements , but with the decidedly nationalist features of Armenian architecture . She gained a reputation for corner structures and her ability to design in harmony with the surrounding spaces , utilizing such elements as concave arcades to offset the straight lines of a street .",
      "In 1945 Ter-Avetikian was recognized by the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and in 1956 , she was again designated as a Laureate of the All-Union Review . In 1968 , Ter-Avetikian became an architect emeritus and she retired in 1972 . After Armenia gained its independence from the Soviet Union , Ter-Avetikian was recognized by the Republic of Armenia , receiving the Alexander Tamanian Gold Medal in 2002 . In 2008 , she received the Gold Medal of Yerevan , from the city , on the event of her 100th birthday . She was the subject of a featured article in the magazine Architecture , Construction ( ) in 2012 , in which she and her work were compared to the noted Brazilian centenarian and architect Oscar Niemeyer .",
      "Death and legacy .",
      "Ter-Avetikian died on 16 January 2013 in Yerevan , Armenia . She designed over forty buildings throughout Armenia , including the landmark Ponchikanots building ."

      "The GCR Class 11E was a type of 4-4-0 steam locomotive used by the Great Central Railway for express passenger services . Ten were built in the railways own workshops at Gorton , Manchester during 1913 ; they remained in service until the mid-1950s .",
      "History .",
      "In the early part of the 20th century , the Great Central Railway ( GCR ) had favoured the 4-4-0 wheel arrangement for express passenger services . They had bought 40 such locomotives to the design of their Locomotive Engineer , John G . Robinson ( Robinson became Chief Mechanical Engineer in 1902 ) , between 1901 and 1904 , and these formed class 11B . These were found to be too small , and subsequently several classes of 4-4-2 and 4-6-0 locomotive were introduced for express passenger trains , with the 4-4-2 type predominating . After the class 1 4-6-0 , which were larger than any of the others , proved disappointing , Robinson decided to reduce the size of these and designed a 4-4-0 which became Class 11E . Ten were built in 1913 , and were immediately successful .",
      "Compared to the class 1 4-6-0 , the omission of one coupled axle allowed a longer wheelbase between two adjacent axles of a 4-4-0 than with the 4-6-0 , so the firebox could be positioned between the axles instead of on top of one of them ; thus it could be deeper , giving better draughting which aided steaming . The shorter overall length meant that the boiler tubes were shorter , which also improved draughting .",
      "Unusually , outside admission was used for the piston valves of the cylinders . Conventionally , piston valve locomotives had inside admission , whereas outside admission was used with slide valve locomotives . Outside admission gives a shorter exhaust passage , with the consequent advantages of a lower back pressure and sharper blast , but with the disadvantage that the valve spindle glands must be made to withstand much higher pressures and temperatures . Robinson had previously used outside admission for his class 11D rebuilds from class 11B , and the new class 11E used the same cylinder casting as those rebuilds . When further 4-4-0s of similar capability to class 11E were required after World War I , these were given normal cylinders with inside admission for the piston valves , and so were placed in class 11F .",
      "Withdrawal occurred between March 1953 and November 1955 .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "On 27 February 1927 , locomotive No . 5437 Prince George was hauling an express passenger train that was involved in a collision with a light engine at Yorkshire .",
      "Numbers and names .",
      "The original names were those of directors of the GCR ; Sir Alexander Henderson was the Chairman of the Board , and William Purdon Viccars was Deputy Chairman . At the time , there were twelve members of the GCR Board ; of these , two ( Viscount Cross and Sir Alexander Henderson ) already had locomotives named after them . However , the latters name was removed from class 11B no . 1014 and used on class 11E no . 429 , so one director was not honoured at this stage ; this was rectified the following year when class 1A 4-6-0 no . 439 was named Sutton Nelthorpe .",
      "Two locomotives had their names altered subsequently , one of them twice . Sir Alexander Henderson was created Baron Faringdon in 1916 , but his new name was used on a class 9P 4-6-0 , so in 1917 no . 429 was renamed Sir Douglas Haig after the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force . In turn , Sir Douglas was created Earl Haig in 1919 and his new name used on another class 9P 4-6-0 , so no . 429 was renamed a second time , becoming Prince Henry after the fourth child of King George V . When Charles Stuart-Wortley was raised to the peerage as Baron Stuart of Wortley in 1917 , his name was used on a further class 9P , so no . 437 was renamed Prince George after the fifth child of King George V .",
      "After the 1923 Grouping , the LNER increased the GCR numbers by 5000 , this occurring in 1924\u20135 . Under the 1946 renumbering , they became 2650\u20139 in the same order . During 1948\u201350 , British Railways increased these numbers by 60000 ."

      "Dixie State University",
      "Dixie State University ( DSU or , colloquially , Dixie ) is a public university in St . George , Utah , in the states Dixie region . The university offers 4 masters degrees , 45 bachelors degrees , 11 associate degrees , 44 minors , and 23 certificates/endorsements . In the fall of 2019 , there were 11,193 students enrolled at DSU and the university had an 80% acceptance rate . The student body was 56% female and 44% male and DSU was among the top three institutions for diversity in the state of Utah with 23% of the student body being minority students .",
      "The institution began as St . George Stake Academy , founded in 1911 by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) . Later it became a state school of the Utah System of Higher Education.Until 2000 , it was a two-year junior college , named Dixie College . In 2000 it became Dixie State College . In February 2013 the school officially became Dixie State University .",
      "DSUs 15 athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I and are collectively known as the Dixie State Trailblazers . The Trailblazers football team joined the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference in 2016 , and the Womens Swimming team competes in the Pacific Collegiate Swim Conference , but DSUs 13 other teams belong to the PacWest Conference . Dixie State announced that the university will reclassify to NCAA Division I and join the Western Athletic Conference ( WAC ) beginning in the 2020\u20132021 season . As the WAC does not sponsor football , Dixie States football program will compete as a FCS independent .",
      "In December 2020 , Dixie State Universitys board of trustees voted to remove the word Dixie from its name .",
      "History .",
      "The institution was founded by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) on September 19 , 1911 , as St . George Stake Academy . In 1916 , the academy , located in a region called Utahs Dixie by Brigham Young and local settlers , became Dixie Normal College , and then , in 1923 , the name was changed to Dixie Junior College . In 1933 , the LDS Church discontinued its support of the college , and rather than give up on it , the local citizenry came together and maintained the schools operation through donations and labor for two years .",
      "In 1935 , the State Board of Education took over the funding for the school , but wanted to split the college students from the high school students , with the high school moving under the direction of Washington County . The community resisted , feeling that the approximate 200 college students and similar number of high school students needed to be combined to provide a good-sized student body for the many social and academic programs . Another concern was that the county did not have the funds to build a new high school .",
      "Between 1935 and 1963 there were close calls when various state leaders proposed closing the college , but the local citizens were willing to donate to keep it alive . These local citizens , particularly the Dixie Education Association , raised the funds to purchase four blocks of land on 700 East and 100 South for a new campus . They presented that land to the state which , in turn , agreed to fund a few buildings for a new campus there . In 1957 , the gymnasium was finished and by 1963 four other buildings were ready for college students with the high school students remaining on the downtown campus .",
      "On September 7 , 2007 , Dixie State College Board of Trustees members announced that Dixie State College of Utah would petition the University of Utah to become the University of Utah\u2013St . George . The proposal was approved by the Dixie State College Board of Trustees on October 7 , 2007 , and by the University of Utah Board of Trustees on October 14 , 2007 ; however , this did not come to fruition .",
      "In 2011 , a bill was drafted for the review of the Utah State Legislature and the Utah State Governor to support Dixie State Colleges transition to university status .",
      "The institution contracted with a local advertising firm , Sorenson Advertising , to investigate names for the institution as a university and found that alumni overwhelmingly supported the name Dixie while less than half of faculty/staff supported the name Dixie ( p . 48 ) . Controversy over the name Dixie has arisen many times . In December 2020 , the universitys board of trustees unanimously voted to recommend removing the word Dixie from the schools name .",
      "In 2013 , the Utah Legislature changed the status of the institution from a college to a university and named it Dixie State University . Governor Gary Herbert signed the bill into law in a ceremony on campus , calling the new university into existence on February 16 , 2013 . President Stephen Nadauld of Dixie State University and others recognized this step as the fulfillment of the dream of the original Mormon pioneers of the area to have a university for their communities . That same year the Board of Trustees approved a student-driven proposed campus-wide tobacco ban . The ban prohibits all tobacco products , including electronic cigarettes . The ban went into effect on January 1 , 2014 .",
      "Also in 2013 , Dixie State University student Indigo Klabanoff pushed for the creation of a sorority and its financial support . DSU did not approve it or the creation of clubs with Greek letters in their names ( excepting honor societies ) , because they said introducing Greek Life properly requires significant funding and the inherent partying stereotype of a Greek system was not a culture they wanted to encourage on campus .",
      "In December 2014 , theater professor Varlo Davenport received a notice of dismissal and termination of employment in connection with a student complaint of an alleged assault but because of his tenure was allowed to request a termination appeal hearing as outlined in DSU Policy . A reinstatement petition was started by students that ultimately garnered over 1,400 signatures , many letters were also sent to the State Board of Regents from the community and faculty members . A faculty review board convened , and after hearing testimony and evidence from both sides , recommended Davenports reinstatement . In the final review of the hearing evidence and testimony , DSU President Williams found the faculty review boards recommendation to be contrary to the information presented . He rejected the recommendation and upheld the termination . Members of the faculty review board subsequently met with President Williams , pressing for a change in his decision . They were unsuccessful . The student pressed charges and the City of St . George agreed to file Class B misdemeanor charges in Justice Court . In the ensuing 2016 City of St . George v . Davenport trial , the jury found him not guilty .",
      "Accusations of censorship .",
      "In 2015 , in accordance with school policy , three students requested permission from the university to post fliers with satirical images of former President George W . Bush and revolutionary leader Che Guevara on campus . The university disapproved the request because the fliers violated school policy by mocking people . The three students filed a lawsuit against Dixie State University in federal court , stating that the university violated their Constitutional right to free speech with an overly restrictive and overly vague school policy .",
      "Shortly thereafter , President Williams announced that all campus policies that infringed upon free expression and free speech were temporarily rescinded and new directives were being drafted . A few months later , Dixie State University settled the lawsuit with the three plaintiffs involved in the case . The university agreed to pay the students $50,000 total in damages and attorney fees . The university also agreed to revise its speech policies that the three plaintiffs said were restrictive and vague .",
      "Campus .",
      "The primary campus of Dixie State University is in St . George , Utah . The Hurricane Education Center campus extension located in Hurricane , Utah , is 20 minutes to the east . At the center of DSU campus is the Encampment Mall , where Mormon pioneers first camped when they arrived in 1861 to settle and grow cotton in the desert .",
      "Academics .",
      "The university offers over 150 academic programs . Dixie State currently offers three masters degrees , 52 bachelors degrees with 65 different emphases , as well as 19 associate degrees , 36 minors , and 16 certificate options . On January 26 , 2018 , the university added its first graduate degree program , a Master of Accountancy .",
      "Student life .",
      "Dixie State Universitys Student Association ( DSUSA ) is a federated student administrative body overseeing the functions , funding , and promotion of official student organizations . Executive and legislative power is primarily vested in an elected Executive Council , the Presidents Cabinet , and the Student Senate . Student clubs interact with the DSUSA governing bodies primarily through non-elected Club Representatives . Club Representatives work on behalf of the following organizational categories : Academic Clubs , Student Organizations , Non-Traditional Clubs , Multicultural and Diversity Clubs , Health Science Clubs , and Athletic and Recreation Clubs . All Executive Council members and most Managers receive some sort of financial aid in return for their work .",
      "Various responsibilities fall to DSUSA including the planning of most on-campus events , charity and service work , and relations between university students and the schools faculty and surrounding community . Any student is able to apply for any position in DSUSA , and if chosen is asked to maintain good academic and community standing , while abiding by the universitys other rules and bylaws .",
      "The DSUSA Inter-Club Council ( ICC ) comprises all the university club presidents and DSUSAs Club Council . ICC meetings are held bi-weekly and club presidents are encouraged to attend .",
      "In August 2019 , students of DSU created a nationally recognized chapter of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity .",

      "Jacqueline Cochran",
      "Jacqueline Cochran ( May 11 , 1906 \u2013 August 9 , 1980 ) was an American pilot and business executive . She pioneered womens aviation as one of the most prominent racing pilots of her generation . She set numerous records and was the first woman to break the sound barrier on 18 May 1953 . Cochran was the wartime head of the Women Airforce Service Pilots ( WASP ) ( 1943\u201344 ) , which employed about 1000 civilian American women in a non-combat role to ferry planes from factories to port cities .",
      "Early life .",
      "Jacqueline Cochran , born Bessie Lee Pittman , in Pensacola , ( some sources indicate she was born in DeFuniak Springs ) in the Florida Panhandle , was the youngest of the five children of Mary ( Grant ) and Ira Pittman , a skilled millwright who frequently relocated setting up and reworking sawmills . While her family was not wealthy , Cochrans childhood living in small-town Florida was similar to those in other families of the era . Contrary to some accounts , there was always food on the table and she was not adopted , as she often claimed .",
      "Circa 1920 , ( she would have been 13 or 14 ) , she married Robert Cochran and gave birth to a son , Robert , who died in 1925 at the age of 5 . After the marriage ended , she kept the name Cochran and began using Jacqueline or Jackie as her given name . Cochran then became a hairdresser and got a job in Pensacola , eventually moving to New York City . There , she used her looks and driving personality to get a job at a prestigious salon at Saks Fifth Avenue .",
      "Although Cochran denied her family and her past , she remained in touch with them and provided for them over the years . Some of her family moved to her ranch in California after she remarried . They were instructed to always say they were her adopted family . Cochran apparently wanted to hide from the public the early chapters of her life and was successful in doing so until after her death .",
      "Later Cochran met Floyd Bostwick Odlum , founder of Atlas Corp . and CEO of RKO in Hollywood . Fourteen years her senior , he was reputed to be one of the 10 wealthiest men in the world . Odlum became enamored of Cochran and offered to help her establish a cosmetics business .",
      "After a friend offered her a ride in an aircraft , Cochran began taking flying lessons at Roosevelt Airfield , Long Island in the early 1930s and learned to fly an aircraft in three weeks . She then soloed and within two years obtained her commercial pilots license . Odlum , whom she married in 1936 after his divorce , was an astute financier and savvy marketer who recognized the value of publicity for her business . Calling her line of cosmetics Wings to Beauty , she flew her own aircraft around the country promoting her products . Years later , Odlum used his Hollywood connections to get Marilyn Monroe to endorse Cochrans line of lipstick .",
      "Contributions to aviation .",
      "Known by her friends as Jackie , and maintaining the Cochran name , she was one of three women to compete in the MacRobertson Air Race in 1934 . In 1937 , she was the only woman to compete in the Bendix race and worked with Amelia Earhart to open the race to women . That year , she also set a new womens world speed record . By 1938 , she was considered the best female pilot in the United States . She had won the Bendix and set a new transcontinental speed record as well as altitude records . Cochran was the first woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic . She won five Harmon Trophies . Sometimes called the Speed Queen , at the time of her death , no other pilot held more speed , distance , or altitude records in aviation history than Cochran .",
      "Air Transport Auxiliary .",
      "Before the United States joined World War II , Cochran was part of Wings for Britain , an organization that ferried American-built aircraft to Britain , becoming the first woman to fly a bomber ( a Lockheed Hudson V ) across the Atlantic . In Britain , she volunteered her services to the Royal Air Force . For several months she worked for the British Air Transport Auxiliary ( ATA ) , recruiting qualified women pilots in the United States and taking them to England where they joined the ATA . Cochran attained the rank of Flight Captain ( equivalent to a Squadron Leader in the RAF or a Major in the U.S . Air Force ) in the ATA .",
      "Women Airforce Service Pilots .",
      "In September , 1939 , Cochran wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt to introduce the proposal of starting a womens flying division in the Army Air Forces . She felt that qualified women pilots could do all of the domestic , noncombat aviation jobs necessary to release more male pilots for combat . She pictured herself in command of these women , with the same standings as Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby , who was then the director of the Womens Army Auxiliary Corps ( WAAC ) . ( The WAAC was given full military status on July 1 , 1943 , thus making them part of the Army . At the same time , the unit was renamed Womens Army Corps ( WAC ) . )",
      "That same year , Cochran wrote a letter to Lieutenant Colonel Robert Olds , who was helping to organize the Air Corps Ferrying Command for the Air Corps at the time . ( Ferrying Command was originally a courier/aircraft delivery service , but evolved into the air transport branch of the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) as the Air Transport Command ) . In the letter , Cochran suggested that women pilots be employed to fly non-combat missions for the new command . In early 1941 , Olds asked Cochran to find out how many women pilots there were in the United States , what their flying times were , their skills , their interest in flying for the country , and personal information about them . She used records from the Civil Aeronautics Administration to gather the data .",
      "In spite of pilot shortages , Lieutenant General Henry H . Hap Arnold was the person who needed to be convinced that women pilots were the solution to his staffing problems . Arnold , Chief of the Air Corps , continued as commanding general of the Army Air Forces upon its creation in June 1941 . He knew that women were being used successfully in the ATA in England so Arnold suggested that Cochran take a group of qualified female pilots to see how the British were doing . He promised her that no decisions regarding women flying for the USAAF would be made until she returned .",
      "When Arnold asked Cochran to go to Britain to study the ATA , Cochran asked 76 of the most qualified female pilots \u2013 identified during the research she had done earlier for Olds \u2013 to come along and fly for the ATA . Qualifications for these women were high : at least 300 hours of flying time , but most of the women pilots had over 1,000 hours . Those who made it to Canada found out that the washout rate was also high . A total of 25 women passed the tests and , two months later in March 1942 they went to Britain with Cochran to join the ATA .",
      "While Cochran was in England , in September 1942 , General Arnold authorized the formation of the Womens Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron ( WAFS ) under the direction of Nancy Harkness Love . The WAFS began at New Castle Air Base in Wilmington , Delaware , with a group of female pilots whose objective was to ferry military aircraft . Hearing about the WAFS , Cochran immediately returned from England . Cochrans experience in Britain with the ATA convinced her that women pilots could be trained to do much more than ferrying . Lobbying Arnold for expanded flying opportunities for female pilots , he sanctioned the creation of the Womens Flying Training Detachment ( WFTD ) , headed by Cochran . In August 1943 , the WAFS and the WFTD merged to create the Women Airforce Service Pilots ( WASP ) with Cochran as director and Nancy Love as head of the ferrying division .",
      "As director of the WASP , Cochran supervised the training of hundreds of women pilots at the former Avenger Field in Sweetwater , Texas from August 1943 to December 1944 .",
      "Award of the Distinguished Service Medal .",
      "For her wartime service , she received the Distinguished Service Medal ( DSM ) in 1945 . Her award of the DSM was announced in a War Department press release dated March 1 , 1945 which stated that Cochran was the first woman civilian to receive the DSM , which was then the highest non-combat award presented by the United States government . ( In actuality , however , a few civilian women received the DSM for service during the First World War . These women included Hannah J . Patterson and Anna Howard Shaw of the Council of National Defense , Evangeline Booth of the Salvation Army as well as Mary V . Andress and Jane A . Delano of the American Red Cross. )",
      "Postwar .",
      "At wars end , Cochran was hired by a magazine to report on global postwar events . In this role , she witnessed Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashitas surrender in the Philippines and was then the first non-Japanese woman to enter Japan after the War and attended the Nuremberg Trials in Germany .",
      "On September 9 , 1948 , Cochran joined the U.S . Air Force Reserve as a lieutenant colonel . She was promoted to colonel in 1969 and retired in 1970 . She was , quite probably , the first woman pilot in the United States Air Force . During her career in the Air Force Reserve , she received three awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross for various achievements from 1947 to 1964 .",
      "Flying records .",
      "Postwar , Cochran began flying the new jet aircraft , setting numerous records . She became the first woman pilot to go supersonic .",
      "In 1952 , Cochran , at age 47 , decided to challenge the world speed record for women , then held by Jacqueline Auriol . She tried to borrow an F-86 from the U.S . Air Force , but was refused . She was introduced to an Air Vice-Marshal of the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) who , with the permission of the Canadian Minister of Defence , arranged for her to borrow 19200 , the sole Sabre 3 . Canadair sent a 16-man support team to California for the attempt . On 18 May 1953 , Cochran set a new 100 km speed record of 1,050.15 km/h ( 652.5 mph ) . Later on 3 June , she set a new 15 km closed circuit record of 1078 km/h ( 670 mph ) . Encouraged by then-Major Chuck Yeager , with whom Cochran shared a lifelong friendship , on May 18 , 1953 , at Rogers Dry Lake , California , Cochran flew the Sabre 3 at an average speed of 652.337 mph . During the course of this run the Sabre went supersonic , and Cochran became the first woman to break the sound barrier .",
      "Among her many record accomplishments , from August to October 1961 , as a consultant to Northrop Corporation , Cochran set a series of speed , distance and altitude records while flying a Northrop T-38A-30-NO Talon supersonic trainer , serial number 60-0551 . On the final day of the record series , she set two F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale ( FAI ) world records , taking the T-38 to altitudes of 55,252.625 feet ( 16,841 m ) in horizontal flight and reaching a peak altitude of 56,072.835 feet ( 17,091 m ) .",
      "Cochran was also the first woman to land and take off from an aircraft carrier , the first woman to pilot a bomber across the North Atlantic ( in 1941 ) and later to fly a jet aircraft on a transatlantic flight , the first woman to make a blind ( instrument ) landing , the only woman ever to be president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale ( 1958\u20131961 ) , the first woman to fly a fixed-wing , jet aircraft across the Atlantic , the first pilot to fly above 20,000 feet ( 6,096 m ) with an oxygen mask , and the first woman to enter the Bendix Transcontinental Race . She still holds more distance and speed records than any pilot living or dead , male or female .",
      "Because of her interest in all forms of aviation , Cochran flew the Goodyear Blimp in the early 1960s with Goodyear Blimp Captain R . W . Crosier in Akron , Ohio .",
      "Mercury 13 .",
      "In the 1960s , Cochran was a sponsor of the Mercury 13 program , an early effort to test the ability of women to be astronauts . Thirteen women pilots passed the same preliminary tests as the male astronauts of the Mercury program before the program was cancelled . It was never a NASA initiative , though it was spearheaded by two members of the NASA Life Sciences Committee , one of whom , William Randolph Lovelace II , was a close friend of Cochran and her husband . Though Cochran initially supported the program , she was later responsible for delaying further phases of testing , and letters from her to members of the Navy and NASA expressing concern over whether the program was to be run properly and in accordance with NASA goals may have significantly contributed to the eventual cancellation of the program . It is generally accepted that Cochran turned against the program out of concern that she would no longer be the most prominent female aviator .",
      "On 17 and 18 July 1962 , Representative Victor Anfuso ( D-NY ) convened public hearings before a special Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics to determine whether or not the exclusion of women from the astronaut program was discriminatory , during which John Glenn and Scott Carpenter testified against admitting women to the astronaut program . Cochran herself argued against bringing women into the space program , saying that time was of the essence , and moving forward as planned was the only way to beat the Soviets in the Space Race . ( None of the women who had passed the tests were military jet test pilots , nor did they have engineering degrees , which were the two basic experiential qualifications for potential astronauts . Women were not allowed to be military jet test pilots at that time . On average , however , they all had more flight experience than the male astronauts. ) NASA required all astronauts to be graduates of military jet test piloting programs and have engineering degrees . In 1962 , no women could meet these requirements . This ended the Mercury 13 program . However , John Glenn and Scott Carpenter , who were part of the Mercury 7 , also did not have engineering degrees when they were selected . Both of them were granted a degree after their flights for NASA .",
      "Significantly , the hearings investigated the possibility of gender discrimination a two full years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made that illegal , making these hearings a marker of how ideas about womens rights permeated political discourse even before they were enshrined in law .",
      "Political activities .",
      "A lifelong Republican , Cochran , as a result of her involvement in politics and the military , became close friends with General Dwight Eisenhower . In the early part of 1952 , she and her husband helped sponsor a large rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in support of an Eisenhower presidential candidacy .",
      "The rally was documented on film and Cochran personally flew it to France for a special showing at Eisenhowers headquarters . Her efforts proved a major factor in convincing Eisenhower to run for President of the United States in 1952 and she played a major role in his successful campaign . Close friends thereafter , Eisenhower frequently visited her and her husband at their California ranch and after leaving office , wrote portions of his memoirs there .",
      "Politically ambitious , Cochran ran for Congress in 1956 from Californias 29th Congressional District as the candidate of the Republican Party . Her name appeared throughout the campaign and on the ballot as Jacqueline Cochran-Odlum . Although she defeated a field of five male opponents to win the Republican nomination , in the general election she lost a close election to Democratic candidate and first Asian-American congressman Dalip Singh Saund . Saund won with 54,989 votes ( 51.5% ) to Cochrans 51,690 votes ( 48.5% ) . Her political setback was one of the few failures she ever experienced and she never attempted another run . Those who knew Cochran have said that the loss bothered her for the rest of her life .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Cochran died on August 9 , 1980 at her home in Indio , California that she shared with her husband until he had died four years prior . She was a long-time resident of the Coachella Valley and is buried in Coachella Valley Public Cemetery . She regularly utilized Thermal Airport over the course of her long aviation career . The airport , which had been renamed Desert Resorts Regional , was again renamed Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in her honor .",
      "Cochrans aviation accomplishments never gained the continuing media attention given those of Amelia Earhart . Also , Cochrans use of her husbands immense wealth reduced the rags-to-riches nature of her story . Nonetheless , she deserves a place in the ranks of famous women aviators and as a woman who frequently used her influence to advance the cause of women in aviation .",
      "Despite her lack of formal education , Cochran had a quick mind and an affinity for business and her investment in the cosmetics field proved a lucrative one . Later , in 1951 , the Boston Chamber of Commerce voted her one of the 25 outstanding businesswomen in America . In 1953 and 1954 , the Associated Press named her Woman of the Year in Business .",
      "Cochran served on the Board of Trustees for the George Washington University from 1962 until her passing in 1980 .",
      "Blessed by fame and wealth , Cochran donated a great deal of time and money to charitable works .",
      "Military awards .",

Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles , California , on June 5 , 1968 ; Kennedy died the following day at Good Samaritan Hospital . Sirhan was convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence at the Richard J . Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego County , California .",
      "Sirhan was born in Jerusalem to an Arab Christian family , where he attended a Lutheran school . In 1989 , he told David Frost , My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 [ fighter jet ] bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians . Some scholars believe that the assassination was the first major incident of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict in the Middle East .",
      "Early life .",
      "Sirhan was born into an Arab Palestinian Christian family in Jerusalem , Mandatory Palestine . According to his mother , as a child Sirhan was traumatized by the violence he witnessed in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict , including the death of his older brother , who was run over by a Jordanian military vehicle that was swerving to escape Israeli gunfire .",
      "When Sirhan was 12 years old , his family immigrated to the US , moving briefly to New York and then to California . In Altadena , he attended Eliot Junior High School , followed by John Muir High School and Pasadena City College , both in Pasadena . Sirhans father , Bishara , has been characterized as a stern man who often beat his sons harshly . Shortly after the familys move to California , Bishara returned alone to the Middle East . Standing and weighing at 20 years old , Sirhan moved to Corona to train to be a jockey while working at a stable , but lost his job and abandoned the pursuit after suffering a head injury in a racing accident .",
      "Sirhan never became an American citizen , retaining instead his Jordanian citizenship . As an adult , he changed church denominations several times , joining Baptist and Seventh-day Adventist churches . Then in 1966 , he joined the esoteric organization Ancient Mystical Order of the Rose Cross , commonly known as the Rosicrucians .",
      "Robert F . Kennedy assassination .",
      "Around 12:15 a.m . PDT on June 5 , 1968 , Sirhan fired a .22 caliber Iver-Johnson Cadet revolver at United States Senator Robert F . Kennedy and the crowd surrounding him in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles shortly after Kennedy had finished addressing supporters in the hotels main ballroom . Authors George Plimpton , Jimmy Breslin , and Pete Hamill , professional football player Rosey Grier , and 1960 Olympic gold medalist Rafer Johnson were among several men who subdued and disarmed Sirhan after a struggle .",
      "Kennedy was shot three times\u2014once in the head and twice in the back\u2014with a fourth bullet passing through his jacket . He died almost 26 hours later at Good Samaritan Hospital . Five other people at the event were also shot , but all five recovered : Paul Schrade , an official with the United Automobile Workers union ; William Weisel , an ABC TV unit manager ; Ira Goldstein , a reporter with the Continental News Service ; Elizabeth Evans , a friend of Pierre Salinger , one of Kennedys campaign aides ; and Irwin Stroll , a teenage Kennedy volunteer .",
      "In a 2018 interview with The Washington Post , Robert F . Kennedy Jr . said that he traveled to the Richard J . Donovan correctional facility in California to meet with Sirhan , and that after a relatively lengthy conversation ( the details of which he would not disclose ) , believed that Sirhan did not kill his father and that a second gunman was involved .",
      "Prosecution .",
      "Despite the fact that Sirhan admitted his guilt in a recorded confession while in police custody on June 9 , a lengthy , publicized trial followed in The People of the State of California v . Sirhan Sirhan . The judge did not accept his confession and denied his request to withdraw his plea of not guilty in order to plead guilty .",
      "On February 10 , 1969 , Sirhans lawyers made a motion in chambers to enter a plea of guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for life imprisonment rather than the death penalty . Sirhan told Judge Herbert V . Walker that he wanted to withdraw his original plea of not guilty in order to plead guilty as charged on all counts . He also asked that his counsel dissociate themselves from this case completely . The judge asked him what he wanted to do about sentencing , and Sirhan replied , I will ask to be executed . Walker denied the motion and said , This court will not accept the plea . He also denied Sirhans request for his counsel to withdraw ; his counsel entered another motion to withdraw from the case of their own volition , but Walker denied that as well . Walker subsequently ordered that the record be sealed pertaining to the motion .",
      "The trial proceeded , and opening statements began on February 12 . The lead prosecutor in the case was Lynn Buck Compton , a World War II veteran of Easy Company fame who later became a justice of the California Court of Appeal . David Fitts delivered the prosecutions opening statement , providing examples of Sirhans preparations to kill Kennedy . The prosecution showed that Sirhan was seen at the Ambassador Hotel on June 3 , two nights before the attack , to learn the buildings layout , and that he visited a gun range on June 4 . Alvin Clark , Sirhans garbage collector , testified that Sirhan had told him a month before the attack of his intention to shoot Kennedy .",
      "Sirhans defense counsel included attorney Grant Cooper , who had hoped to demonstrate that the killing had been the impulsive act of a man with a mental deficiency . But Walker admitted into evidence pages from three of the journal notebooks Sirhan had kept that suggested the crime was premeditated and quite calculating and willful . On March 3 , Cooper asked Sirhan in direct testimony if he had shot Kennedy ; Sirhan replied , Yes , sir , but then said that he did not bear Kennedy any ill will . Sirhan also testified that he had killed Kennedy with 20 years of malice aforethought . He explained in an interview with David Frost in 1989 that this referred to the time since the creation of the State of Israel . He has maintained since then that he has no memory of the crime , or of making that statement in court .",
      "The defense based its case primarily on the expert testimony of Bernard L . Diamond , M.D. , a professor of law and psychiatry at the University of California , Berkeley who testified that Sirhan was suffering from diminished capacity at the time of the murder .",
      "Sirhan was convicted on April 17 , 1969 , and was sentenced six days later to death in the gas chamber . Three years later , his sentence was commuted to life in prison , owing to the California Supreme Courts decision in The People of the State of California vs . Robert Page Anderson , which ruled that capital punishment is a violation of the California Constitutions prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment . The February 1972 decision was retroactive , invalidating all existing death sentences in California .",
      "Appeals .",
      "Sirhans lawyer Lawrence Teeter later argued that Grant Cooper was compromised by a conflict of interest and was , as a consequence , grossly negligent in defense of his client . The defense moved for a new trial amid claims of setups , police bungles , hypnotism , brainwashing , blackmail , and government conspiracies . On June 5 , 2003 , coincidentally the 35th anniversary of Kennedys assassination , Teeter petitioned a federal court in Los Angeles to move the case to Fresno . He argued that Sirhan could not get a fair hearing in Los Angeles , where a man who helped prosecute him was then a federal judge : U.S . District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr . in Los Angeles was an assistant U.S . attorney during Sirhans trial , and part of the prosecutorial team .",
      "Since 1994 Teeter had been trying to have state and federal courts overturn Sirhans conviction , arguing his client was hypnotized and framed , possibly by a government conspiracy . During one hearing Teeter referred to testimony from the original trial transcripts regarding a prosecution eyewitness to the attack , author George Plimpton , in which he said that Sirhan looked enormously composed . He seemed .. . purged . This statement coincided with the defenses argument that Sirhan had shot Kennedy while in some kind of hypnotic trance . The motion was denied . Teeter died in 2005 , and Sirhan declined other counsel to replace him .",
      "On November 26 , 2011 , Sirhans defense teams filed court papers for a new trial , saying that expert analysis of recently uncovered evidence shows two guns were fired in the assassination and that Sirhans revolver was not the gun that shot Kennedy and he should be freed from prison or granted a new trial based on formidable evidence , asserting his innocence and horrendous violations of his rights .",
      "On January 5 , 2015 , Sirhans motion was denied by U.S . District Judge Beverly Reid OConnell in Los Angeles , who said that Sirhan failed to meet the showing required for actual innocence that might excuse his having failed to seek his freedom sooner in federal court . In other words , Sirhans case was not strong enough . Though petitioner advances a number of theories regarding the events of June 5 , 1968 , petitioner does not dispute that he fired eight rounds of gunfire in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel , OConnell wrote . Petitioner does not show that it is more likely than not that no juror , acting reasonably , would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .",
      "Motives .",
      "A motive cited for Sirhans actions is the Middle East conflict . After his arrest , Sirhan said , I can explain it . I did it for my country . Sirhan believed that he was deliberately betrayed by Kennedys support for Israel in the June 1967 Six-Day War , which had begun one year to the day before the assassination . During a search of Sirhans apartment after his arrest , a spiral-bound notebook was found containing a diary entry that demonstrated that his anger had gradually fixated on Kennedy , who had promised to send 50 fighter jets to Israel if elected president . Sirhans journal entry of May 18 , 1968 , read : My determination to eliminate R.F.K . is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession...Kennedy must die before June 5th . They found other notebooks and diary entries expressing his growing rage at Kennedy ; his journals also contained many nonsensical scribbles that were thought to be his version of free writing . He wrote in support of communism : Long live Communism.. . I firmly support the communist cause and its people.. . American capitalism will fall and give way to the workers dictatorship .",
      "The next day , on June 6 , the Los Angeles Times printed an article by Jerry Cohen that discussed Sirhans motive for the assassination , confirmed by the memos Sirhan wrote to himself . The article stated : When the Jordanian nationalist , Sirhan Bishara Sirhan , allegedly shot Kennedy , ostensibly because of the senators advocacy of U.S . support for Israel , the crime with which he was charged was in essence another manifestation of the centuries-old hatred between Arab and Jew .",
      "M.T . Mehdi , then secretary-general of the Action Committee on American-Arab Relations , believed that Sirhan had acted in justifiable self-defense , stating : Sirhan was defending himself against those 50 Phantom jets Kennedy was sending to Israel . Mehdi wrote a 100-page book on the subject called Kennedy and Sirhan : Why ?",
      "Later in prison , Sirhan claimed that he had been drunk . An interview with Sirhan in 1980 revealed new claims that a combination of liquor and anger over the anniversary of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war had triggered his actions . You must remember the circumstances of that night , June 5 . That was when I was provoked , Sirhan says , recorded in a transcript of one of his interviews with Mehdi , later president of the New York-based American-Arab Relations Committee . That is when I initially went to observe the Jewish Zionist parade in celebration of the June 5 , 1967 , victory over the Arabs . That was the catalyst that triggered me on that night . Then Sirhan said , In addition , there was the consumption of the liquor , and I want the public to understand that .",
      "Imprisonment .",
      "In 1971 , Sirhan was housed in the Adjustment Center at San Quentin State Prison . He was subsequently transferred to the Correctional Training Facility ( CTF ) in Soledad , California , where he was confined until 1992 . From 1992 to 2009 he was confined at the California State Prison ( COR ) in Corcoran , California , and lived in CORs Protective Housing Unit until he was moved to a harsher lockdown at COR in 2003 . In October 2009 , ostensibly for his safety , he was transferred to the Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga , California , where he was housed in a cell by himself . He was subsequently moved back to Corcoran .",
      "On November 22 , 2013 , Sirhan was transferred from Corcoran to the Richard J . Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego County . The transfer occurred on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F . Kennedy , but a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said that the transfer was a routine matter of housing allotments and its timing was simply an unfortunate coincidence .",
      "On August 30 , 2019 , Sirhan was stabbed multiple times by another prisoner . He was taken to a hospital , where his condition was reported as stable . He returned to the prison two days later , after his discharge from the hospital .",
      "Applications for parole .",
      "In a 1980 interview with M . T . Mehdi , Sirhan claimed that his actions were fueled by liquor and anger . He then complained that the parole board was not taking these mitigating circumstances into account when they continually denied his parole .",
      "On May 10 , 1982 , Sirhan told the parole board : I sincerely believe that if Robert Kennedy were alive today , I believe he would not countenance singling me out for this kind of treatment . I think he would be among the first to say that , however horrible the deed I committed 14 years ago was , that it should not be the cause for denying me equal treatment under the laws of this country .",
      "On March 2 , 2011 , Sirhan was denied parole for the 14th time .",
      "On February 10 , 2016 , at his 15th parole hearing , he was denied parole again . One of Sirhans shooting victims from that night , Paul Schrade , aged 91 at the time of the hearing , testified in his support , stating his belief that a second shooter killed Kennedy and that Sirhan was intended to be a distraction from the real gunman by an unknown conspiracy . Sirhan repeated his claim to have no memory of the shooting , stating : Its all vague now . Im sure you all have it in your records . I cant deny it or confirm it . I just wish this whole thing had never taken place . His parole was denied on the grounds that he had not expressed adequate remorse for his crime or acknowledged its severity .",
      "Supporters .",
      "In 1974 , Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn dedicated their communist manifesto Prairie Fire : The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism to Sirhan ( along with 200 others ) , hailing him as a courageous political prisoner . In February 1973 , Sirhans release was one of the demands of Black September terrorists who took American hostages at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum ."

      "Rachel Ruysch",
      "Rachel Ruysch ( 3 June 1664 \u2013 12 October 1750 ) was a Dutch still-life painter from the Northern Netherlands . She specialized in flowers , inventing her own style and achieving international fame in her lifetime . Due to a long and successful career that spanned over six decades , she became the best documented woman painter of the Dutch Golden Age , being followed by Jan van Huysum , who took flower painting to another degree of popularity .",
      "Personal life and career .",
      "Rachel Ruysch was born on 3 June 1664 in The Hague to the scientist Frederik Ruysch and Maria Post , the daughter of the architect Pieter Post . Her father was also a professor of anatomy and botany . He had a vast collection of animal skeletons , and mineral and botany samples which Rachel used to practice her drawing skills . At a young age she began to paint the flowers and insects of her fathers collection in the popular manner of Otto Marseus van Schrieck . Working from these samples Rachel matched her fathers ability to depict nature with great accuracy . Later , as Rachel became more accomplished , she taught her father ( and also her sister , Anna Ruysch ) how to paint .",
      "In 1679 , at age fifteen , Ruysch was apprenticed to Willem van Aelst , a prominent flower painter in Amsterdam . His studio in Amsterdam looked out over the studio of the flower painter Maria van Oosterwijck . Ruysch studied with van Aelst until his death in 1683 . Besides painting technique he taught her how to arrange a bouquet in a vase so it would look spontaneous and less formalized . This technique produced a more realistic and three-dimensional effect in her paintings . By the time Ruysch was eighteen she was producing and selling independently signed works . She would also have known and consorted with the flower painters Jan and Maria Moninckx , Alida Withoos , and Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff , who all were about her age and who worked for the hortus owner Agnes Block and who , like her father , also worked with the plant collectors Jan and Caspar Commelin .",
      "In 1693 she married the Amsterdam portrait painter Juriaen Pool , with whom she had ten children . Throughout her marriage and adult life she continued to paint and produce commissions for an international circle of patrons . Other women at this time were expected to participate in art forms more traditionally practiced by women , such as sewing and spinning . Ruysch continued working as a painter after she married , mostly likely because her contribution to the familys income allowed them to hire help to care for their children .",
      "Ruysch died in Amsterdam on 12 October 1750 . After her death , despite changing attitudes about flower paintings , Ruysch has maintained a strong reputation .",
      "Works .",
      "It is unknown whether Ruysch was a member of the Amsterdam Guild of Saint Luke , but early signed works by her in the 1680s show the influence of Otto Marseus van Schrieck . By 1699 she and her family had moved to The Hague , where she was offered membership in the Confrerie Pictura as their first female member . In 1701 she and her husband became members of The Hague Painters Guild . In 1708 , Ruysch was invited to work for the court in D\u00fcsseldorf and serve as court painter to Johann Wilhelm , Elector Palatine . She obtained a contract for works painted at home that she periodically brought to D\u00fcsseldorf . She continued working for him and his wife from 1708 until the princes death in 1716 .",
      "Art historians consider Ruysch to be one of the most talented still life artists of either sex . By the time of her death at age 86 she had produced hundreds of paintings , of which more than 250 have been documented or are attributed to her .",
      "Her dated works establish that she painted from the age of 15 until she was 83 , a few years before her death . Historians are able to establish this with certainty because she included her age when signing her paintings .",
      "Style .",
      "Ruysch had a very good understanding of drawing and the techniques of earlier traditions . This knowledge improved her painting abilities . Stylistically , her artwork , with its playful composition and brilliant colors , was part of the rococo movement . She paid extensive attention to all details in her work . Every petal was created painstakingly with delicate brushwork . The background of Ruyschs paintings are usually dark which was the fashion for flower painting in the second half of the 17th century . Her asymmetrical compositions with drooping flowers and wild stems created paintings that seemed to possess a great energy about them .",
      "In her early work Ruysch painted a large number of forest floor pictures that feature small animals , reptiles , butterflies , and fungi . She later adopted flower painting as her main concern and continued to paint until her death , thus continuing the 17th-century style right down to the middle of the following century .",
      "Ruyschs skill lay in the minute observation of each flower in an extremely naturalistic way , composed into an elaborate arrangement that would be very difficult to achieve in nature \u2013 the flowers would not support each other so well under such an arrangement . In common with most flower pieces from the last third of the 17th century , the colours of the flowers are much more carefully balanced than in the earlier pictures .",
      "The symbolism of each flower was elaborately developed in the 17th century , but most of this concerned the introduction of a single flower into a Vanitas piece . Apart from Jan van Huysum , no 18th-century flower painter matched the skill of Rachel Ruysch .",
      "Reception .",
      "Ruysch enjoyed great fame and reputation in her lifetime . When she died in 1750 , eleven poets paid her their respects with poems about her . In the 17th century the Dutch were very interested in flowers and gardening , so paintings that highlighted the beauty of nature were highly valued . This helped to build and maintain Ruyschs clientele throughout her career . In her lifetime her paintings were sold for prices as high as 750\u20131200 guilders . In comparison , Rembrandt rarely received more than 500 guilders for a painting in his lifetime .",
      "In 1999 a painting by Ruysch was discovered in a farmhouse in Normandy and was sold at auction for 2.9 million French francs , about US$508,000 .",
      "In March of 2021 Leysters work was added to the Gallery of Honor at the Rijksmuseum . Ruysch , Gesina ter Borch , and Judith Leyster are the first women to be included in the gallery .",

      "Georgetown Car Barn",
      "The Georgetown Car Barn , historically known as the Capital Traction Company Union Station , is a building in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington , D.C. , in the United States . Designed by the architect Waddy Butler Wood , it was built between 1895 and 1897 by the Capital Traction Company as a union terminal for several Washington and Virginia streetcar lines . The adjacent Exorcist steps , later named after their appearance in William Friedkins 1973 horror film The Exorcist , were built during the initial construction to connect M Street with Prospect Street .",
      "Intended for dual use as a passenger station and as a storage house for the streetcars , the Car Barn began Washingtons only cable car system . Almost immediately after the building opened , the system was electrified , and the Car Barn was converted to accommodate electric streetcars . Throughout its history as a terminal and storage facility , the Car Barn was never utilized to the extent anticipated by its construction .",
      "The building has undergone several renovations , the most extensive in 1911 , when the original Romanesque Revival fa\u00e7ade was significantly modified , and the interior was almost completely gutted . Not long after its opening , the building fell into disrepair . Changing ownership over time , it maintained its original function of housing streetcars until 1950 , when it was redeveloped as office space . Among its occupants was the International Police Academy , an arm of the Central Intelligence Agency , which operated out of the Car Barn in the 1960s and 1970s . Today , it is used as an academic building by Georgetown University . In 2019 , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
      "History .",
      "The Car Barns original foundation supported a warehouse constructed in 1761 to store tobacco for auction unloaded from ships docked at the location of the present-day Key Bridge . The warehouse was converted to keep horses and their trolleys around 1861 . On August 23 , 1894 , Congress authorized the extension of an existing trolley line terminating at the intersection of Bridge and High Streets ( now Wisconsin Avenue and M Street respectively ) to the intersection of M and 36th Streets . With the authorization , Congress required that a union station be erected at the site . Thereafter , the site was used to store horse-drawn trolley cars .",
      "Construction .",
      "Construction on the building then known as Union Station began in early 1895 under the architectural direction of Waddy Butler Wood . The superintendent and chief engineer of the Capital Traction Company , D.S . Carll , was in charge of the construction . Before construction of the Car Barn , the two streets were joined by a steep hillside that carried 36th Street . Large amounts of earth were excavated\u2014 in total\u2014resulting in the sharp cliff that exists today . Adjacent to the Car Barn are a set of stairs commonly known as the Exorcist steps and a large retaining wall , which were built at the time the Car Barn was constructed , to connect M and Prospect Streets . The steps are so named as they provided the location for the scene in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist where the priest is thrown down the stairs to his death .",
      "The buildings construction was opposed by the next-door resident of the Prospect House , who furnished affidavits by prominent architects stating that blasting from the construction was damaging her house ; this led to court-ordered supervision of the blasting in 1894 . After the Car Barns construction , the large edifice obstructed the view of the Potomac River and Virginia from homes on Prospect Street , including the well-known cottage of E . D . E . N . Southworth . For this reason , some considered it a desecration of the local scenery .",
      "The three-story , building was opened on May 27 , 1897 , containing offices for the several tenant trolley companies and waiting rooms that were decorated with red oak wainscot panelling , ornate iron stair railings , and stuccoed ceilings . The exterior was designed in the Romanesque Revival style . Its tower , which reached a height of , contained an elevator that shuttled passengers between the terminals . Many of the buildings decorations reflect its original function . The pediment facing M Street reads Capital Traction Company and contains three decorative flywheels .",
      "The M Street-facing first floor served the Washington and Georgetown Railroad . The second and third floors were connected with steel trestles to allow for trolleys coming across the Potomac River from Rosslyn , which served Washington , Arlington , Falls Church , and were projected to serve the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad . The roof , which was level with Prospect Street , was used by the Metropolitan Railroad and had a covered walkway for passengers to get from the elevator to Prospect street .",
      "The station operated as Washingtons only cable car trolley terminal for less than a year . Almost immediately after opening , the Car Barn was converted to operate the new electric streetcars . The Virginia lines never made use of the terminal , and the Metropolitan Railroad did not use the station to the extent intended . It intended to place storage tracks on the roof of the building but never did .",
      "Re-design .",
      "Although regarded as well-designed before 1900 , the Car Barn began a period of deterioration and neglect lasting for 50 years . The first stage of the transition from a trolley station to an office building was carried out between 1906 and 1908 when portions of the second floor were converted into office space . The electrification of streetcars necessitated a large-scale re-design of the Barn , which began in 1910 . The entrances to the building were extended to accommodate the larger cars , and a new elevator was installed to lift streetcars to the roof . This transition required a near-complete reconstruction of the building . The steel support beams were replaced , and the entire fa\u00e7ade was changed to extend toward M Street and increase its height to allow more office space . These modifications were complete in 1911 .",
      "Further conversions of track space to office space occurred between 1921 and 1922 . Extensive remodeling occurred again in 1933 with the designation of the Car Barn as the headquarters of the new Capital Transit Company , as a result of the merger between the Capital Traction Company and the Washington Railway and Electric Company , which increased the number of office workers at the building . These changes involved removing the roof in the center of the building , creating a lightwell on the third floor , converting the third floor into office space , and removing the covered passageway on the roof .",
      "Later uses .",
      "The last streetcar operations at the Car Barn ended with the closure of the Rosslyn\u2013Benning Line on April 30 , 1949 . The building continued to store streetcars until May 1950 . Toward the end of 1952 , the first floor was converted into office space .",
      "When the Capital Transit Company merged with its competitors , the building came under the ownership of its new corporate successor , the DC Transit System , in 1956 . By then , the building had fallen into such a state of disrepair that the company deliberated over whether to demolish it entirely . Seeking to preserve the historic structure , it elected to redevelop it . The building underwent considerable interior renovations between 1957 and 1960 , intended to turn the structure entirely into an office building . This involved lowering the ceilings , which were previously designed to accommodate the height of the streetcars . The building was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1967 .",
      "Beginning in late 1963 , the Car Barn was home to the International Police Academy , operated by the Central Intelligence Agency ( though officially part of the Agency for International Development ) that trained Latin American police forces ; members of these forces met at the Car Barn until the program was shut down in 1975 .",
      "In 1992 , the owner of the DC Transit System , O . Roy Chalk , was subject to foreclosure , and the building came under the ownership of the Lutheran Brotherhood . The Car Barn was purchased in 1997 by Douglas Development Corporation\u2014which continues to own the building\u2014and it was renovated the following year . The primary tenant is Georgetown University , which first began leasing space in the 1950s . After two years of renovation by the university that ended in 2017 , the first floor garage was converted to house the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Georgetown University Press . The building today has four floors and has a floor area of . The Car Barn was listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on January 24 , 2019 , and the National Register of Historic Places as part of a multiple property submission named Streetcar and Bus Resources of Washington , DC on August 9 , 2019 ."

      "Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub ( Russian : \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d H\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0431 ; Ukrainian : \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d \u041c\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0431 ; 8 June 1920 \u2013 8 August 1991 ) was a Soviet World War II fighter ace . Credited with over 60 solo victories by most historians , he is considered to be the highest scoring Soviet and Allied fighter pilot of World War II . He is one of the few pilots to have shot down a Messerschmitt Me 262 jet . He was made a Hero of the Soviet Union on three occasions ( 4 February 1944 , 19 August 1944 , and 18 August 1945 ) . After the war he remained in the military and commanded the 324th Fighter Air Division during Soviet operations in the Korean War .",
      "Early life .",
      "Ivan Kozhedub was born in the village of Obrazhiyevka , a settlement in the Chernigov Governorate , Ukrainian SSR ( now Sumy Oblast , Ukraine ) on 8 June 1920 . He was the youngest of five children in a Ukrainian family . For two years he attended a school for young workers , and in early 1940 graduated from the Shostka chemical technical school . Kozhedub learned to fly aircraft in the Shostkinsk aeroclub and joined the Soviet army in 1940 . He graduated from the Chuguev Military Air School in June 1941 at the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union , but he was retained as an instructor . Kozhedub remained at the school for nearly two years where he trained many young Soviet pilots .",
      "Feeling his talents would be better used in combat , Kozhedub requested a transfer to an operational unit and in March 1943 he was posted , as a Senior Sergeant , to the 240th Fighter Aviation Regiment , one of the first units to receive the new Lavochkin La-5 .",
      "War career .",
      "His first combat mission was on 26 March 1943 . He operated on the Voronezh Front and , in July over the Kursk battlefields . His first kill was a Junkers Ju 87 Stuka , shot down during the Battle of Kursk on 6 July 1943 . By 16 August he had claimed eight air victories . He was promoted to Junior Lieutenant . Then his unit moved towards Kharkiv . At this time he usually flew escort for Petlyakov Pe-2 twin-engine bombers . He served as a fighter pilot in several areas ( Steppe Front , 2nd Ukrainian Front , 1st Belorussian Front ) and at different ranks , starting from senior airman up to deputy commander of his air regiment . He claimed his 61st and 62nd victories \u2013 his final claims of the War\u2013 over Berlin on 16 April 1945 .",
      "Kozhedub was attributed with the highest number of air combat victories of any Soviet pilot during World War II . He is regarded as the best Soviet flying ace of the war , and is associated with flying the Lavochkin La-7 . He was reputed to have a natural gift for deflection shooting , i.e . aiming ahead of a moving target at the time of firing so that the projectile and target will collide .",
      "Kozhedubs World War II record consisted of :",
      "- 330 combat missions",
      "- 120 aerial engagements",
      "- 62 enemy aircraft shot down , including one Me 262 jet fighter ( possibly Uffz Kurt Lange of 1./KG ( J ) 54. )",
      "Post war era .",
      "In 1949 Kozhedub graduated from the Air Force Academy .",
      "In April 1951 , promoted to Polkovnik ( colonel ) , he commanded the 324th IAD ( Fighter Air Division ) and dispatched to Antung airfield on the China-North Korea border to fly the MiG-15 during the Korean War supporting the North Korean forces . He was not given permission to participate in combat missions . Under his leadership the 324th IAD claimed 239 victories , including 12 Boeing B-29 Superfortresses for the loss of 27 MiG-15s in combat and 9 pilots .",
      "In 1956 he graduated from the High Command Academy , after which he was promoted to General . From 1971 he served in the Central Office of the Soviet Air Force and from 1978 in the general inspection group of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR . He was made an Aviation Marshal in 1985 .",
      "Kozhedub was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union three times ( 1944 , 1944 , 1945 ) , seven Orders of the Red Banner , two Order of Alexander Nevsky , two Orders of the Red Star , Order of the Patriotic War First Class , and numerous medals . He was promoted to his final rank of Marshal shortly before retirement .",
      "List of aerial victories .",
      "According to Soviet aces 1941\u20141945 . The victories of Stalins Falcons ( ) by Mikhail Bykov .",
      "- Until August 1944 Kozhedub was flying on Lavochkin La-5 , after that Lavochkin La-7 .",
      "Alleged shooting down of two USAAF P-51 fighters .",
      "Kozhedub allegedly shot down two USAAF P-51 Mustang fighters in a friendly fire incident 17 April 1945 . He encountered a group of American B-17 Flying Fortresses under attack by Luftwaffe aircraft . His aircraft was apparently mistaken by American escort fighters for the enemy and attacked . Kozhedub , having no other option , defended himself by shooting down two of the P-51s . So far , this story is not confirmed completely . Film footage exists that had been touted as Kozhedubs actual gun camera film from the event ; however , the footage was shot using Zeiss equipment , which was used primarily by the Luftwaffe .",

      "German submarine U-38 ( 1938 )",
      "German submarine U-38 was a Type IXA U-boat of Nazi Germanys Kriegsmarine that operated during World War II .",
      "Her keel was laid down on 15 April 1937 , by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen as yard number 943 . She was launched on 9 August 1938 and commissioned on 24 October with Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Heinrich Liebe in command .",
      "U-38 conducted eleven patrols , as part of several flotillas . During her career , she sank over 30 enemy vessels and damaged a further one . U-38 ranks as one of the most successful U-boats in World War II . She was scuttled west of Weserm\u00fcnde ( modern Bremerhaven ) on 5 May 1945 . Throughout the war , the U-Boat suffered no losses among her crew .",
      "Design .",
      "As one of the eight original German Type IX submarines , later designated IXA , U-38 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged . The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke , nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced , two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged . She had two shafts and two propellers . The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .",
      "The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged , the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced , she could travel at . U-38 was fitted with six torpedo tubes ( four fitted at the bow and two at the stern ) , 22 torpedoes , one SK C/32 naval gun , 180 rounds , and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun . The boat had a complement of forty-eight .",
      "Service history .",
      "1st Patrol .",
      "U-38 left the port of Wilhelmshaven on 19 August 1939 . The boat operated off the coast of Lisbon , returning to port on 18 September . During this four-week period , she sank two ships .",
      "On 5 September 1939 U-38 stopped the French ship Pluvoise , examined her papers and released her . Pluvoise broadcast the event , warning others of the U-boat . For this , Liebe was reprimanded . The already strict rules restricting submarine warfare were further tightened to prevent a recurrence of the event and all U-boats were instructed to avoid contact with any French merchant vessels .",
      "The British steam freighter SS Manaar was sunk on 6 September 1939 . U-38 opened fire on the freighter , intending to stop her , but she returned fire . This was the first time that a merchantman fired at a U-boat . Stunned by this unexpected response , U-38 dived and sank Manaar with torpedoes . Citing the fact that Manaar had fired at him , Liebe did not assist the survivors , reasoning that the vessel was exempted from protection by the Submarine Protocol . Berlin would release to the media the narrative that the Manaar had fired on U-38 on sight . While Karl D\u00f6nitz did not believe that his submarines should have to maintain adherence to the Submarine Protocol in the face of armed merchantmen , due to the political situation , restrictions remained in force after this incident and he was merely able to issue instruction to all submarines to exercise caution . Radio Officer James Turner remained at his post until the last moment . As he was leaving he found two Lascars , one badly injured . Turner rescued both men while under continuous fire from U-38 , for this he was awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal .",
      "On 11 September 1939 , while flying the Irish tricolour , Inverliffey was shelled and sunk . In spite of Captain William Trowsdales protestation that they were Irish , Liebe said that they were sorry but they would sink Inverliffey as she was carrying contraband petrol to England . The crew took to the lifeboats . Inverliffey burned fiercely , endangering the lifeboats . At risk to herself , the German submarine approached , threw lines to the lifeboats and towed them to safety . As Captain Trowsdales lifeboat was damaged , the occupants were allowed to board the U-boat . The captain did not have a lifebelt , so he was given one . U-38 stopped the American tanker R.G . Stewart and put Inverliffeys crew on board . Just two days earlier , Inver tankers transferred its ships from the Irish to the British registry .",
      "2nd Patrol .",
      "After nearly two months in port , U-38 left Wilhelmshaven , again with Heinrich Liebe in command , on 12 November 1939 . This second patrol was to see the boat operate in the waters northwest of Norway .",
      "On 17 November 1939 , Naval High Command ( SKL ) issued orders for U-38 and to scout the location for Basis Nord , a secret German naval base to be used for raids on allied shipping which was located off the Kola Peninsula and provided by the Soviet Union . The mission required coded messages to be flashed to Soviet naval vessels patrolling the area preceding a Soviet escort to the prospective base location .",
      "U-36 never left the Norwegian Sea and was sunk by the British submarine . U-38 rounded the North Cape uneventfully and arrived in Teriberka Bay by mid-afternoon on 26 November . Running silently into the bay , U-38 had to avoid being spotted by merchant vessels in order to help maintain the Soviet Unions attempted appearance of neutrality at that time . U-38s captain commented that , while in the area of the North Cape and the Kola Peninsula , he had observed thirty to forty targets and regrettably had been harmless to [ all ] of them .",
      "After completing the clandestine reconnaissance mission , U-38 returned to raiding duties and sank three ships , two British and one Greek . The British steam freighter SS Thomas Walton was sunk on 7 December . The Greek steam freighter SS Garoufalia was destroyed on 11 December , as was the British steam freighter on 13 December . After an operational period of four and a half weeks , U-38 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 16 December .",
      "3rd Patrol .",
      "Once again , U-38 would spend considerable time in port , prior to sailing on 26 February 1940 , for operations in the Western Approaches .",
      "U-38 sank six ships . First sent to the bottom was the neutral Irish steam trawler on 9 March , with a single shell at point-blank range off Tory Island , all 11 crew were lost . The Leukos was fishing in the company of British trawlers ; it has been speculated that she positioned herself between the surfacing U-boat and the fleeing British in the belief that her neutral markings would protect her . This event was followed by the sinking of the Danish motor freighters SS Argentina on 17 March and SS Algier and SS Christiansborg on 21 March . The Norwegian motor freighter MV Cometa was sunk on 26 March . The sixth and final ship sunk during this third patrol was the Finnish steam freighter SS Signe on 2 April . After nearly six weeks on the high seas , U-38 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 5 April 1940 .",
      "4th Patrol .",
      "U-38 left her home port of Wilhelmshaven with Heinrich Liebe in command on 8 April 1940 . She would sweep the waters off Norway , supporting the occupation of that country by Nazi troops . During this patrol , U-38 reported problems with her torpedoes , after was fired upon with no result . U-38 would return to port on 27 April .",
      "There were two naval battles of Narvik on 10 and 13 April 1940 . U-38 and U-65 were positioned at the entrance to the fjord . When the Royal Navy arrived , U-38 fired at and at missing both . In the second battle , U-38 fired at Effingham , but the torpedoes malfunctioned , ( exploding prematurely ) .",
      "5th Patrol .",
      "For her fifth patrol , U-38 would again depart from Wilhelmshaven with Heinrich Liebe in command on 6 June 1940 . She was to patrol the waters off southern Ireland . During this operation , Liebe would hit six ships , two of which were sailing in convoy at the time . On 14 June , U-38 sank the Greek steam freighter SS Mount Myrto . The next day , U-38 sank two ships , both sailing as part of Convoy HX 47 , sailing from Halifax to England . First sunk was the Canadian steam freighter SS Erik Boye , followed by the Norwegian motor tanker MV Italia . Five days later , on 20 June , the Swedish steam freighter SS Tilia Gorthon was torpedoed and sunk . The Belgian steam freighter SS Luxembourg was destroyed on 21 June , followed by the Greek steam freighter SS Neion the following day . After three weeks at sea , U-38 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 2 July .",
      "During this patrol , U-38 was able to land Walter Simon , a Nazi agent , at Dingle Bay in Ireland on 12 June . Not realising that the passenger services of the Tralee and Dingle Light Railway had been closed fourteen months earlier , he asked when the next train to Dublin was . He was arrested and interned in the Curragh Camp for the duration of the war .",
      "6th Patrol .",
      "U-38 would depart Wilhelmshaven for the last time on 1 August 1940 , again with Heinrich Liebe in command . On this month-long patrol off the western coast of Ireland , U-38 would hit and sink three ships , all of which were in convoy at the time of attack . On 7 August the Egyptian liner was sunk while traveling with HX 61 , from Halifax to Gibraltar , 320 died . The British steam freighter SS Llanfair was hit and sunk , travelling as part of SL-41 from Sierra Leone to England . The third and final ship hit on the sixth patrol of U-38 was the British steam freighter SS Har Zion , while travelling with the Convoy OB 225 , from Liverpool to the United States . After four weeks at sea Liebe returned U-38 to her new home port of Lorient in France on 3 September 1940 .",
      "7th Patrol .",
      "For her first patrol from Lorient and her seventh overall , U-38 would again be under the command of Heinrich Liebe . She departed on 25 September , for the Northwest Approaches . She would attack five ships on this patrol , sinking four of them . On 1 October , the British motor freighter MV Highland Patriot was torpedoed . After two weeks of no victories , U-38 was successful against the Greek steam freighter SS Aenos on 17 October , sailing as part of Convoy SC 7 , from Sydney , Nova Scotia to England . The following day , the British steam freighter SS Carsbreck was damaged , but not sunk , while traveling with the SC 7 convoy from Sydney to Grimsby , England . On 19 October , two ships were hit , both sailing as part of the HX 79 convoy : the Dutch SS Bilderdijk and the British steam freighter SS Matheran . Following these victories , U-38 returned to Lorient on 24 October 1940 .",
      "8th Patrol .",
      "U-38 would depart Lorient with Liebe in command once again on 18 December 1940 . The eighth war patrol of her career would involve operations again in the Northwest Approaches . During this patrol , the submarine would hit and sink two ships .

U-38 returned to port on 22 January 1941 .",
      "9th Patrol .",
      "U-38 would spend two and a half months in port , before leaving for operations off the west coast of Africa on 9 April 1941 . This would prove to be her most successful patrol , with the sinking of eight ships . On 4 May , the Swedish steam freighter SS Japan was torpedoed while traveling with Convoy OB 310 from England to the United States . The following day , the British motor freighter MV Queen Maud was hit and sunk .

      "Mike Lee ( American politician )",
      "Michael Shumway Lee ( born June 4 , 1971 ) is an American politician , businessman and attorney serving as the senior United States Senator from Utah . A conservative Republican , Lee has served in the Senate since January 3 , 2011 .",
      "Lee began his career as a clerk for the U.S . District Court for the District of Utah before clerking for future Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito , who was then a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals . From 2002 to 2005 , Lee was an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Utah . Subsequently , he joined the administration of Utah Governor Jon Huntsman , serving as the general counsel in the governors office from 2005 to 2006 .",
      "In 2010 , during the Tea Party movement , Lee entered the party caucus process to challenge incumbent three-term Republican senator Bob Bennett . He defeated Bennett and business owner Tim Bridgewater during the nominating process at the Utah Republican Party Convention . Lee won the Republican primary , and defeated Democratic nominee Sam Granato in the general election . He was reelected in 2016 and became the dean of Utahs congressional delegation when Representative Rob Bishop retired in January 2021 . Lee chaired the Joint Economic Committee from 2019 to 2021 .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Lee was born in Mesa , Arizona on June 4 , 1971 , the son of Janet ( n\u00e9e Griffin ) and Rex E . Lee . His family moved to Provo , Utah , one year later , when his father became the founding dean of Brigham Young Universitys J . Reuben Clark Law School . While Lee spent about half of his childhood years in Utah , he spent the other half in McLean , Virginia , a suburb of Washington , D.C . His father served first as an Assistant U.S . Attorney General ( overseeing the Civil Division of the U.S . Department of Justice during the Ford Administration ) from 1975 until 1976 , and then as the Solicitor General of the United States ( charged with representing the U.S . government before the Supreme Court during the first term of the Reagan Administration ) . Lee is of English , Swiss , and Danish descent .",
      "Growing up , Lee went to school with Senator Strom Thurmonds daughter , Nancy Moore Thurmond , and lived three doors down from Senator Robert Byrd . He was also friends with Harry Reids son Josh .",
      "After graduating from Timpview High School in 1989 , Lee attended Brigham Young University . He served as the president of BYUSA , and as student body president during the 1993\u201394 school year , serving together with his father , who was then president of BYU . He graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science . Lee then attended BYUs J . Reuben Clark Law School , where he was a member of the BYU Law Review and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1997 .",
      "Legal career .",
      "After law school , Lee clerked for Judge Dee Benson of the U.S . District Court for the District of Utah from 1997 to 1998 , then for Judge ( later Supreme Court Justice ) Samuel Alito of the U.S . Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1998 to 1999 .",
      "After his clerkships , Lee joined the American law firm Sidley Austin , where he worked in the Washington , D.C. , office and specialized in appellate and Supreme Court litigation . Several years later , Lee returned to Utah to serve as an Assistant United States Attorney in Salt Lake City , preparing briefs and arguing cases before the U.S . Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit . He served as general counsel to Utah Governor Jon M . Huntsman , Jr . from January 2005 until June 2006 , when he returned to Washington to serve a one-year clerkship with Alito at the Supreme Court . Lee returned to private practice in Utah the next year , joining the Salt Lake office of the law firm of Howrey LLP .",
      "As an attorney , Lee also represented Class A low-level radioactive waste facility provider EnergySolutions Inc . in a highly publicized dispute between the company and the Utah public and public officials that caused controversy during his first Senate election . Utahs government had allowed the company to store radioactive waste in Utah as long as it was low-grade Class A material . When the company arranged to store waste from Italy , many objected that the waste was foreign and could be more radioactive than permitted . Lee argued that the Commerce Clause of the U.S . Constitution allowed the company to accept foreign waste and that the waste could be reduced in grade by mixing it with lower-grade materials , while the state government sought to ban the importation of foreign waste using an interstate radioactive waste compact . EnergySolutions eventually abandoned its plans to store Italian radioactive waste in Utah , ending the dispute , with the 10th U.S . Circuit court later ruling that the compact had the power to block foreign radioactive waste from being stored in Utah .",
      "U.S . Senate .",
      "Elections .",
      "2010 .",
      "Lee ran for the U.S . Senate in 2010 . When campaigning , he focused on the size of the federal government . He said the U.S . Constitution needed to be amended to create a flat-tax system and impose term limits on members of Congress . Senators would be allowed up to two terms and representatives up to six terms under the proposal .",
      "At the Republican State Convention , he received 982 votes ( 28.75% ) on the first ballot , to Tim Bridgewaters 26.84% and incumbent U.S . Senator Bob Bennetts 25.91% . Bridgewater won the second and third ballots to win the party endorsement . Both Bridgewater and Lee received enough support to have their names placed on the primary ballot .",
      "In the June 22 primary election , Lee won the Republican nomination with 51% of the vote to Bridgewaters 49% .",
      "Lee won the November 2 general election with 62% of the vote to Democratic nominee Sam Granatos 33% and Constitution Party nominee Scott Bradleys 6% .",
      "2016 .",
      "Lee was reelected in 2016 . He was endorsed by the Club for Growth , the Senate Conservatives Fund , and the National Republican Senatorial Committee .",
      "2022 .",
      "Potential GOP primary challengers to Lee include Becky Edwards , former member of the Utah House of Representatives ; Henry Eyring , teacher at the London School of Economics and Political Science , and grandson of Henry B . Eyring ; Jeff Flake , former US Senator from Arizona ; and former Utah State Senator Dan Hemmert .",
      "Tenure .",
      "Scorecards and rankings .",
      "In 2011 , Club for Growth gave Lee a 100% score . He also received a 100% Conservative voting record for 2011 from the American Conservative Union . The Heritage Foundation gave him a 99% score , tied for first with Jim DeMint . He received a Liberal Action score of 38% .",
      "2016 presidential election .",
      "In March 2016 , Lee endorsed Ted Cruz over Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican primary . He was the first senator to do so . At the time , he said , I expect I\u2019ll be the first of many Republican senators who will endorse Ted Cruz . Im confident more are on the way , and I welcome others to join . By June , after Trump had become the presumptive nominee , Lee had still not endorsed him , saying he needed assurances that Trump would not act as an authoritarian or autocrat and expressing frustration that Trump had accused my best friend\u2019s father of conspiring to kill JFK .",
      "2017 Alabama special election .",
      "On October 16 , 2017 , Lee endorsed Roy Moore in the 2017 Alabama special election runoff to fill the seat of U.S . Attorney General and former senator Jeff Sessions . Moore had been removed as the Alabama Supreme Courts chief justice in 2003 for defying a federal order to remove an illegal Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama Judicial Building . He was reelected chief justice in 2012 . In May 2016 , Moore was once again removed from the bench by the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission ( JIC ) , permanently via suspension for the rest of his term , making him ineligible for reelection , for ordering state probate judges to ignore a U.S . Supreme Court decision . In a 50-page opinion , the Court of the Judiciary denied Moores appeal of the JICs decision , and said his removal was necessary to preserve the integrity , independence , impartiality of Alabamas judiciary . Nevertheless , Lee praised Moore for his reputation of integrity and said he was essential to getting conservative legislation through the Senate . That is why I am proudly endorsing Judge Roy Moore . Alabamians have the chance to send a proven , conservative fighter to the United States Senate , On November 9 , 2017 , Moore was accused of molesting a 14-year-old and other girls under age 18 when he was 32 .",
      "On November 10 , Lee asked the Moore campaign to stop using Lees endorsement of Moore in its ads . Lees spokesperson said of the sexual misconduct allegations , If these allegations are true , Judge Moore should resign . Later that day , Lee rescinded his endorsement of Moore .",
      "2020 presidential election .",
      "On October 28 , 2020 , Lee compared President Trump to Captain Moroni , a heroic figure in the Book of Mormon . Lee told rallygoers in Arizona : To my Mormon <nowiki> [ sic ] </nowiki> friends , my Latter-day Saint friends , think of him as Captain Moroni . Lee went on to say that Trump seeks not the praise of the world and wants only the well-being and peace of the American people . His comparison met with backlash . The overwhelming majority of comments on Lees Facebook accounts found it shameful or blasphemous . In a followup Facebook post , Lee pointed out that he had praised Trump for his willingness to threaten the established political order , but admitted that the comparison was perhaps awkward and recognized that his impromptu comments may not have been the best forum for drawing a novel analogy from scripture .",
      "After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election , Trump refused to concede , and a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S . Capitol , Lee said that Trump should be given a mulligan ( or a do-over ) for his inflammatory political speech immediately before the storming of the Capitol . Lee later defended his remarks , saying , my reference to taking a mulligan was not referring to Trump , but to Democratic politicians whose inflammatory comments had just been played for me on the air <nowiki> [ on Fox News ] </nowiki> . I used the term.. . to avoid needlessly inflaming partisan passions . On May 28 , 2021 , Lee voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the riot .",

      "Political positions .",
      "Lee is a conservative Republican . The New York Times used the NOMINATE system to rank Senate members by ideology ; Lee ranked as the Senates most conservative member . GovTracks 2017 analysis placed Lee on the right end of the spectrum , to the right of most Republicans , but to the left of a handful of Republican senators . FiveThirtyEight , which tracks Congressional votes , found that Lee voted with Trumps positions on legislation 81.3% of the time as of July 2018 .",
      "Democracy and election reform .",
      "In October 2020 , Lee sent a series of tweets declaring that the United States is not a democracy and that democracy isnt the objective ; liberty , peace , and are . Some commentators argued Lee fundamentally misunderstood the terms democracy and republic .",
      "In March 2021 , Lee said on Fox News that the For the People Act was rotten to the core and was as if written in Hell by the devil himself . The act attempts to expand voting rights , change campaign finance laws to reduce the influence of money in politics , limit partisan gerrymandering , and create new ethics rules for federal officeholders . It has been criticized by conservatives , including Lee , who believe its provisions improperly take power over elections away from state governments and give it to the federal government .",
      "Privacy .",
      "In 2017 , Lee voted for S.J.Res.34 , a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5 , United States Code , of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services from taking effect .",
      "Spending .",
      "In September 2018 , Lee was among six Republican senators , including Jeff Flake , Pat Toomey , Rand Paul , David Perdue , Ben Sasse , and Bernie Sanders , to vote against a $854 billion spending bill that would avert another government shutdown . The bill included funding for the departments of Defense , Health and Human Services , Labor and Education .",
      "Healthcare .",
      "Lee was part of the group of 13 senators drafting the Senate version of the AHCA behind closed doors . He eventually came out against the bill , along with Senator Jerry Moran , bringing the no vote total among Republicans to four . This effectively stopped any chance of the bills passage .",
      "Patriot Act .",
      "In February 2011 , Lee was one of two Republicans to vote against extending the three provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act that deal with roving wiretaps , lone wolf terrorism suspects , and the governments ability to seize any tangible items in the course of surveillance . He voted in the same manner in May 2011 .",
      "Social Security .",
      "In April 2011 , Lee , Lindsey Graham , and Rand Paul proposed a plan to reform the U.S . Social Security retirement payment system . Workers born in 1970 and every year thereafter would have to wait until their 70th birthday to retire , and wealthy people would receive smaller monthly checks under the plan . The proposal called for increasing the retirement age to 70 by 2032 , and slightly reducing the benefits to upper-income recipients .",
      "Criminal justice reform .",
      "In 2013 , Lee , Dick Durbin , and Patrick Leahy proposed a bill aiming to focus limited federal resources on the most serious offenders . The bill would reduce some minimum sentences for drug-related offenses by half .",
      "In November 2018 , Lee criticized Senator Tom Cotton for his stance on the proposed First Step Act , a criminal justice reform bill Lee supported . Cotton had said that the legislation gives early release to low level , nonviolent criminals like those convicted of assaulting police , even with deadly weapons . Lee responded that the First Step Act does not give early release to anyone . Anyone claiming it does does not understand how the bill works . The bipartisan bill , drafted by Chuck Grassley , Lee , and Durbin , passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly , 360-59 . The bill intends to improve rehabilitation programs for former prisoners , and to give judges more wiggle room when sentencing nonviolent crime offenders . The bill eventually passed the Senate and became law .",
      "Big Tech .",
      "Lee has worked together with his Democratic counterpart , Amy Klobuchar , to hold Big Tech firms like Facebook , Apple , and Amazon accountable for their growing power . They are working to revamp century-old antitrust lawsuits .",
      "Environment .",
      "In 2017 , Lee was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Trump urging him to withdraw the U.S . from the Paris Agreement . According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Lee has received campaign contributions from oil and gas interests amounting to $231,520 and from coal interests in the amount of $21,895 , for a total of $253,415 since 2012 . At a May 2016 event , Lee took issue with the scientific consensus on climate change , calling it little more than a cheap public-relations ploy by the Democratic party . Lee opposes a carbon tax to deal with climate change .",
      "In 2018 , Lee defended Jim Bridenstines nomination to head NASA . Bridenstines nomination was contentious , given that he rejected the scientific consensus on climate change and had no background in science . In defending Bridenstine , Lee falsely claimed that NASA disputed that there was a scientific consensus on climate change . Since his confirmation , Bridenstine has said that he agrees with the scientific consensus on human contributions to climate change .",
      "On March 26 , 2019 , the Senate opened debate on the Green New Deal . When Lee took the floor , he called the plan absurd , comparing it to an image of Ronald Reagan riding a velociraptor , and argued that having more babies was the real solution . He also claimed that the authors of the Green New Deal proposal are trying to suggest people should not have babies and I think thats atrocious . Deseret News noted , the text of the [ Green New Deal ] resolution does not address population growth or suggest limiting the number of children people can have .",
      "Foreign policy .",
      "As part of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2018 , Lee , Bernie Sanders , and Chris Murphy co-sponsored a resolution that would end U.S . military support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemens civil war . Interviewed by The Hill , he said : regardless of what may have happened with Mr . Khashoggi , we are fighting a war in Yemen that we havent declared , that has never been declared or authorized by Congress . Thats not constitutional . The Senate voted 60\u201339 to formally begin debate on the resolution , which would require the President to withdraw troops in or affecting Yemen within 30 days unless they are fighting al Qaeda .",
      "In April 2018 , Lee was one of eight Republican senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and acting Secretary of State John Sullivan expressing deep concern over a United Nations report exposing North Korean sanctions evasion involving Russia and China and asserting that the findings demonstrate an elaborate and alarming military-venture between rogue , tyrannical states to avoid United States and international sanctions and inflict terror and death upon thousands of innocent people while calling it imperative that the United States provides a swift and appropriate response to the continued use of chemical weapons used by President Assad and his forces , and works to address the shortcomings in sanctions enforcement . He criticized Trump for ordering the 2018 missile strikes against Syria in response to the Douma chemical attack , stating that he lacked the constitutional authority to do so without Congresss permission because the U.S . was not in imminent danger . Lee supported Trumps decision to withdraw American troops from Syria in December 2018 , saying that American forces should not have been in the country anyway without Congressional authorization . He said that the Obama administration had not made clear American objectives in Syria surrounding Assads future , and that he believed Trumps claim that the Islamic State had been defeated .",
      "Lee has long been in favor of ending American involvement in Afghanistan . He signed a letter in 2011 urging Obama to withdraw troops from the country . In May 2017 , he called into question a proposal from military leaders to send additional troops there , calling to mind previous times when more soldiers were sent to the country but which , according to Lee , failed to make a significant difference . Lee maintained that American involvement in the war has wasted thousands of lives and trillions of dollars . In April 2021 , President Joe Biden announced plans to withdraw all remaining US troops from Afganistan by September 11 of that year . At a virtual meeting later that month , Lee stated his support of Bidens plan .",
      "In April 2019 , after the House passed the resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen , Lee was one of nine lawmakers to sign a letter to Trump requesting a meeting with him and urging him to sign Senate Joint Resolution 7 , which invokes the War Powers Act of 1973 to end unauthorized US military participation in the Saudi-led coalitions armed conflict against Yemens Houthi forces , initiated in 2015 by the Obama administration . The group of Senators included Bernie Sanders , Rand Paul , and others . Trump was expected to veto the measure .",
      "In June 2019 , Lee was one of seven Republicans who voted to block Trumps Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia , United Arab Emirates and Jordan .",
      "9/11 Responders Compensation Fund .",
      "On July 17 , 2019 , Jon Stewart and disabled construction worker John Feal criticized Lee and Rand Paul on Fox News for blocking a bill that provided Victims Compensation Fund support for disabled 9/11 responders . The fund was near exhaustion . On the Senate floor , Paul objected to Senator Kirsten Gillibrands request for the bill to be approved by unanimous consent ; per Senate rules , such a request is rejected if any senator objects . Lee had placed such a hold on the measure , despite its 73 Senate co-sponsors .",
      "Stewart and Feal , as well as leaders of the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Firefighters , tried to get both senators to withdraw their objections . The people from the state of Kentucky and the people from the state of Utah deserve better , Feal said . Stewart said , We have to stand up for the people who have always stood up for us , and maybe cannot stand up for themselves due to their illnesses and their injuries . .. . There [ are ] some things that they have no trouble putting on the credit card , but somehow when it comes to the 9/11 first responder community , the cops , the firefighters , the construction workers , the volunteers , the survivors , all of a sudden .. . we gotta go through this . On July 23 , 2019 , Lee was one of two senators to vote against the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund .",
      "Immigration .",
      "In February 2019 , Lee was one of 16 senators to vote against legislation preventing a partial government shutdown and containing $1.375 billion in funding for barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border that included 55 miles of fencing . In that same month , he and Senator Kamala Harris removed the per-country cap on employment-based green cards and raised the cap on family-based green cards from 7% to 15% .",
      "In March 2019 , Lee was one of 12 Republican senators to vote to block Trumps national emergency declaration that would have granted him access to $3.6 billion in military construction funding to build border barriers .",
      "Supreme Court .",
      "In March 2019 , Lee was one of 12 senators to cosponsor a resolution that would impose a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court to nine justices . The resolution was introduced after multiple Democratic presidential candidates expressed openness to the idea of increasing the seats on the Supreme Court .",
      "In September 2020 , less than two months before the next presidential election , Lee supported an immediate Senate vote on Trumps nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs death . In March 2016 , Lee had taken the opposite position by declining to consider Obamas Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year , citing the contentious presidential election already well underway .",
      "Trade .",
      "In January 2018 , Lee was one of 36 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump requesting that he preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) by modernizing it for the economy of the 21st century .",
      "In November 2018 , Lee was one of 12 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump requesting the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( the replacement to NAFTA ) be submitted to Congress by the end of that month to allow a vote on it before the end of the year as they were concerned passage of the USMCA as negotiated will become significantly more difficult if it had to be approved by the incoming 116th United States Congress .",
      "Minorities .",
      "In 2018 , Lee condemned the Inter-American Court of Human Rights , which is part of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , for recommending that Costa Rica legalize same-sex marriage . The courts decision was spurred by a petition by Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis , who was working on ways to improve LGBT rights in Costa Rica . Lee suggested that the U.S. , a primary funder of the OAS , should use its money more wisely and do more to safeguard religious liberties worldwide .",
      "In May 2019 , Lee called the Equality Act counterproductive and argued it unnecessarily pits communities against each other .",

      "Anna Karina",
      "Anna Karina ( born Hanne Karin Bayer , 22 September 194014 December 2019 ) was a Danish-French film avant garde actress , director , writer , and singer . She was French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godards muse in the 1960s , performing in several of his films , including The Little Soldier , A Woman Is a Woman , My Life to Live , ( Band of Outsiders ) , ( Crazy Pete ) and Alphaville . For her performance in A Woman Is a Woman , Karina won the Silver Bear Award for Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival .",
      "In 1972 , Karina set up a production company for her directorial debut , Vivre ensemble ( 1973 ) , which screened in the Critics Week lineup at the 26th Cannes Film Festival . She also directed the French-Canadian film Victoria ( 2008 ) . In addition to her work in cinema , she worked as a singer , and wrote several novels .",
      "Karina was an icon of 1960s cinema , and referred to as the effervescent free spirit of the French New Wave , with all of the scars that the position entails . The New York Times described her as one of the screens great beauties and an enduring symbol of the French New Wave .",
      "Early life .",
      "Hanne Karin Bayer ( later known as Anna Karina ) was born in Frederiksberg , Denmark . Her mother was a dress shop owner and her father left the family a year after she was born .",
      "She lived with her maternal grandparents for three years , then spent the next four years in foster care before returning to live with her mother . She has described her childhood as terribly wanting to be loved , and as a child she made numerous attempts to run away from home . Her mother remarried , but her step-father was abusive .",
      "She began her career in Denmark , where she sang in cabarets and worked as a model playing in commercials . At age 14 , she appeared in a Danish short film by Ib Schmedes , which won a prize at Cannes . In 1958 , after a row with her mother , she hitchhiked to Paris .",
      "Career .",
      "Modeling .",
      "Bayer was 17 when she arrived in Paris , with only 10,000 francs and unable to speak French . One day while sitting at the caf\u00e9 Les Deux Magots she was approached by a woman from an advertisement agency who asked her to do some photos . She began to work as a model and eventually became successful , posing for several magazines , including Elle , and meeting Pierre Cardin and Coco Chanel . Karina said that Chanel helped her devise her professional name , Anna Karina , which was deliberately coined to evoke the Leo Tolstoy novel , Anna Karenina . She appeared on the front cover of the Elle fashion magazine and in commercials for products such as Coca-Cola , Pepsodent , and Palmolive soap .",
      "Film .",
      "Jean-Luc Godard , then a film critic for Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma , first saw Karina in the Palmolive adverts in which she posed in bathtubs , during movie previews in a Monsavon pub . He was casting his debut feature film , Breathless ( \u00c0 bout de souffle , 1960 ) , and offered her a small part in it , but she refused when he mentioned that there would be a nude scene . When Godard questioned her refusal , mentioning her apparent nudity in the Palmolive ads , she is said to have replied , Are you mad ? I was wearing a bathing suit in those ads\u2014the soapsuds went up to my neck . It was in your mind that I was undressed . In the end , the character Godard reserved for Karina did not appear in the film . Godard offered her a role in The Little Soldier ( , not released until 1963 ) which concerns contentious French actions during the Algerian War . She played a pro-Algerian activist . Karina , then still under 21 , had to persuade her estranged mother to sign the contract for her . The film was immediately controversial , outlawed from French theaters for its content referencing the Algerian War .",
      "As Angela in A Woman Is a Woman ( Une femme est une femme , 1961 ) . Karinas role was as an unattached striptease dancer who nevertheless wishes to have a child and daydreams about appearing in MGM musicals . Her school-girl costume emulated Leslie Caron in Gigi ( 1958 ) , worn even while performing her act . Karina won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival for her performance . In all , Karina appeared in eight films directed by Godard , including My Life to Live ( , 1962 ) , Band of Outsiders ( , 1964 ) and Alphaville ( both 1965 ) . In , Karinas character is on the run with her ex-boyfriend , while in Alphaville , a science-fiction film often equated to Bladerunner , Karinas role requires her to have difficulty saying the phrase I love you . The last film in the sequence was Made in USA ( 1966 ) . Anne Billson , in an article querying the concept of the female muse , wrote that Godard in his films with Karina seems to have trouble conceiving that the female experience revolves around anything other than prostitution , duplicity , or wanting babies . Karina herself did not object to being described as Godards muse : Maybe it\u2019s too much , it sounds so pompous . But of course I\u2019m always very touched to hear people say that . Because Jean-Luc gave me a gift to play all of those parts .",
      "Her career flourished , with Karina appearing in dozens of films through the 1960s , including The Nun ( La Religieuse , 1966 ) , directed by Jacques Rivette , Luchino Viscontis The Stranger ( Lo straniero , 1967 ) , the George Cukor/Joseph Strick collaboration Justine ( 1969 ) , and Tony Richardsons Laughter in the Dark ( 1969 ) . She continued to work steadily into the 1970s , with roles in Christian de Chalonges The Wedding Ring ( LAlliance , 1971 ) , Andre Delvauxs Rendezvous at Bray ( Rendez-vous \u00e0 Bray , also 1971 ) , The Salzburg Connection ( 1972 ) , and Franco Brusatis Bread and Chocolate ( Pane e cioccolata , 1973 ) .",
      "In 1972 , she set up a production company , Raska , for her directorial debut , Living Together ( Vivre ensemble , 1973 ) , in which she also acted . The film screened in the Critics\u2019 Week lineup at the 26th Cannes Film Festival .",
      "She starred in Rainer Werner Fassbinders Chinese Roulette ( Chinesisches Roulette , 1976 ) ; Fassbinder allegedly wrote the film for her and her partner at the time , Ulli Lommel . She later wrote and acted in Last Song ( 1987 ) and appeared in Up , Down , Fragile ( Haut bas fragile , 1995 ) , directed by Jacques Rivette , and sang in The Truth About Charlie ( 2002 ) , a remake of the film Charade ( 1963 ) .",
      "Karina wrote , directed and starred in Victoria ( 2008 ) , a musical road movie filmed in Montreal and Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean , Quebec . The lead character , played by Karina , has amnesia . Richard Kuipers praised it in Variety as a pleasant gambol through the backwoods of Quebec .",
      "Music and writing .",
      "Karina maintained a singing career . At the end of the 1960s , she scored a major hit with Sous le soleil exactement and Roller Girl by Serge Gainsbourg . Both songs are from the TV musical comedy Anna ( 1967 ) , by the film director Pierre Koralnik , in which she sings seven songs alongside Gainsbourg and Jean-Claude Brialy . Karina subsequently recorded an album , , with Philippe Katerine , which was followed by a concert tour . In 2005 , she released Chansons de films , a collection of songs sung in movies .",
      "Karina wrote four novels : ( 1973 ) , Golden City ( 1983 ) , ( 1988 ) , and Jusquau bout du hasard ( 1998 ) .",
      "Personal life .",
      "While working together on , Karina and Godard began a relationship and married in 1961 . Eventually , Karina served as a cinematic muse to Godard , appearing in eight of his films , including , and , during their five year marriage and after . Karina liked being the muse . How could I not be honoured ? she told Xan Brooks of The Guardian in 2016 . Maybe it\u2019s too much , it sounds so pompous . But of course I\u2019m always very touched to hear people say that . Because Jean-Luc gave me a gift to play all of those parts . It was like Pygmalion , you know ? I was Eliza Doolittle and he was the teacher . At this , she briefly channels Henry Higgins . By Jove , she says . I think she\u2019s got it .",
      "The couple became , according to The Independent , one of the most celebrated pairings of the 1960s . A writer for Filmmaker magazine called their work arguably the most influential body of work in the history of cinema .",
      "Despite the critical success , their relationship behind the scenes was described as tumultuous ; they fought on film sets , Karina fell ill several times , and Godard was often absent without explanation . One Godard film from this period which does not feature Karina , Contempt ( 1963 ) , is said to be based on their difficult relationship . The couple divorced in 1965 .",
      "Karina said in spring 2016 that she and Godard no longer spoke to each other . She described the relationship in an interview with W magazine:It was all very exciting from the beginning . Of course we have a great love story and all that , but we were so different . He was 10 years older than me . He was very strange . He would go away and come back three weeks later .. . It was difficult , and I was a young girl , not even 21\u2014at the time Godard was 30 . I know he didnt mean to hurt me , but he did . He was never there , he was never coming back , and I never knew where he was . He drove me a bit crazy.After divorcing Godard , Karina remarried three times ; she was married to French actors Pierre Fabre from 1968 to 1974 and Daniel Duval from 1978 to 1981 , and to American film director Dennis Berry from 1982 until her death .",
      "Karina died at the age of 79 on Saturday , December 14 , 2019 , at a hospital in Paris . According to her agent , Laurent Balandras , the cause of death was cancer . However , her husband , Dennis Berry , said that the cause was not cancer , but a complication following a muscular rupture .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Karina is regularly considered an icon of 1960s cinema , a staple in French New Wave cinema , as well as a style icon . The Guardian described her as an effervescent free spirit of the French new wave . The New York Times described her style as looking like a schoolgirl in her acting roles , regardless whether she was playing a streetwalker or a terrorist . Her signature look was her dark hair , wispy bangs , heavy eyeliner and school uniform of primary-coloured sailor-uniform tops , knee socks , plaid headwear such as berets and boaters . Refinery29 wrote that her 60s French girl style \u2013 think sailor dresses , tartan , long socks , and hats \u2013 and mesmerizing doe-eyed beauty mean she continues to be referenced today by the super-stylish .",

      "The Cycle was an ensemble news and political talk show that was broadcast on MSNBC and hosted by four network analysts/commentators : Republican Abby Huntsman , author and culture critic Tour\u00e9 Neblett , The Nation correspondent Ari Melber , and former congressional candidate turned Democratic strategist Krystal Ball . Per its ensemble format , all four hosts appear on every show , with each host taking turns to facilitate the discussions .",
      "The program debuted on June 25 , 2012 , and ran until July 31 , 2015 . On July 30 , 2015 , MSNBC President Phil Griffin announced that the series had been canceled in an effort to transition the networks daytime programming to more breaking news reporting and less political commentary and opinion .",
      "Format .",
      "The Cycle was an ensemble program , with all four hosts appearing on every broadcast , each one taking turns to facilitating the discussion . Usually , the segment was named after the host leading the discussion : Tour\u00e9 TV , Abbys Road , Aris Angle , and Krystal Clear . Spin Cycle was a segment in which each host discusses a story ( usually political ) from their point of view . Guest Spot was a topical discussion with a featured guest of the day . The format was similar to The Five on rival news network Fox News , although the hosts and producers have denied that The Cycle is derivative . Ball , Melber and Tour\u00e9 are self-proclaimed liberal commentators while Huntsman is a self-proclaimed conservative .",

E . Cupp . All four hosts were introduced during the penultimate broadcast of The Dylan Ratigan Show on June 21 , 2012 . The show is seen as continuing a trend of networks emphasis on political talk , and away from newscasts .",
      "The show premiered on June 25 , 2012 . It occupied Martin Bashirs previous time slot at 3pm on weekdays , with Bashir moving to the 4pm hour , replacing Ratigan .",

      "On the June 27 , 2012 , broadcast of the program , co-host Tour\u00e9 hinted that U.S .

Military wouldnt have wanted such a high-profile soldier criticizing the mission in Afghanistan in 2004 .",
      "On the July 5 , 2012 , broadcast , atheist co-host S.E . Cupp said that she would never vote for an atheist president . When asked to explain , Cupp said she felt that a president must not represent only 10 to 15 percent of the American populace and that faith served as a check on presidential power .",
      "On the July 6 , 2012 , broadcast , Cupp accused Ann Romney , wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , of lying about her husbands potential running mate picks .",
      "On the August 16 , 2012 , broadcast , Tour\u00e9 caused a controversy by stating that by calling President Barack Obama angry , Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was engaging in the niggerization of the president . He apologized for using the word the next day .",

She is known for her designs to improve hospitals in Belize including Belize Medical Associates , the Cleopatra White Polyclinic , Matron Robert polyclinic , the Hoy Eye Clinic and the PICU/NICU wing of Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital due to be completed in 2015 . She has served as a Senator and as the Chair of the National Womens Commission , as well as the Belizean delegate to the Inter-American Commission of Women . In 2015 she was awarded the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for contributions to the community .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Esther Josefina Ayuso was born in Caracas , Venezuela , to Josefina ( n\u00e9e Medero ) , a banking clerk , and Oscar Ayuso , a Belizean banking official with the Royal Bank of Canada . Shortly after her birth , the family returned to Belize City in British Honduras . There she would later attend St . Catherine\u2019s Academy High School , graduating in 1975 . That same year she travelled to Caracas with the aim of becoming an architect , but due to differing matriculation requirements for Venezuelan colleges , she was told she had to resit several high-school level courses to successfully secure admission and study at Universidad Central de Venezuela . She diligently pursued all necessary entry requirements , completing all necessary coursework in just two years and securing entry into the architectural program at UCV . In 1983 she graduated with a technological architectural degree . Returning to Belize , she was unable to find immediate work and returned to Venezuela in 1983 . There she met and married a fellow architect , with whom she welcomed two sons in 1990 and 1991 , respectively . The family remained in Caracas until the 1992 Venezuelan coup d\u00e9tat attempts . Returning to her home country of Belize , Ayuso initially secured employment at Professional Engineering Services as an architectural associate , where she remained until 1995 when she and her husband opened their private architectural practice , Arcade Ltd . Besides residences , Ayuso is known for her public works projects which include the expansion of Belize Medical Associates from a small private clinic into a hospital ; remodeling of the Cleopatra White and Matron Robert polyclinics ; and work on the Hoy Eye Clinic and several branches of Atlantic Bank Ltd . In 1996 , the couple welcomed their third son . During Hurricane Keith in 2000 , Arcade Ltd . suffered severe damages and the couple shifted their attention and expertise to the field of architectural and construction consultation .",
      "In 2006 , Ayuso was appointed by Prime Minister Dean Barrow to serve as a Senator . In 2008 , after serving two years on the Senate , Ayuso was appointed chair of the newly organized National Womens Commission ( NWC ) . That same year she was also appointed to serve as Belizes delegate to the Inter-American Commission of Women , a post she still maintains .

      "Marriott Corporation was a hospitality company that operated from 1927 until 1993 , founded by J . Willard Marriott and Frank Kimball as Hot Shoppes , Inc . in 1957 , Marriott Corporation opened its first hotel in Arlington County , Virginia , United States as the Twin Bridges Motor Hotel ( demolished 1990 ) . Marriott Corporations first international property was opened in Acapulco , Mexico , in 1969 . Hot Shoppes became Marriott Corporation in 1967 , which subsequently split into Marriott International , Inc . and Host Marriott Corporation in 1993 .",
      "History .",
      "J . Willard Marriott , who had moved away with his business partner Hugh Colton and his wife Alice from Utah to Washington , D.C. , in 1927 , where he operated a curbside food stand selling A&W Root Beer in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington at 14th Street and Park Road NW . He would later rename the food stand The Hot Shoppe , adding Mexican food items to the menu . Marriotts business expanded to Baltimore , Maryland , in 1934 , shortly after which the company started its food services division . During Second World War , the business expanded to include the management of food services in defense plants and government buildings , such as the U.S . Treasury . They introduced popular items such as the Mighty Mo , a double hamburger served in a bun covered with sesame seeds and divided into three slices that was stacked with a dill pickle stripe in the top layer and tomato , lettuce , and a distinctive sauce on the bottom layer , and very thick milk shakes served with a long-handled spoon and an unusually wide straw . Then in the 1950s , Hot Shoppes , Inc . started providing food services to public schools and to Childrens Hospital in 1955 , a contract which they held for 35 years .",
      "The company went public in 1953 . In 1957 , the firm expanded into the hotel industry by opening the first Marriott hotel ( actually a motel ) , the Twin Bridges Motor Hotel , in Arlington County , Virginia .",
      "In 1964 , Hot Shoppes , Inc . was renamed Marriott-Hot Shoppes , Inc . The company later became Marriott Corporation in 1967 .",
      "In 1967 , Marriott acquired the Big Boy family restaurants chain from Bob Wian .",
      "The following year , Marriott acquired the Fort Wayne-based RoBees , a roast beef sandwich fast-food chain , but later discovered that they would not be able to use the RoBees name nationally . At the suggestion of the new Marriott board member Bob Wian , cowboy actor Roy Rogers was contacted to lend his name to the roast beef sandwich venture , and the Roy Rogers Family Restaurants was formed in a few months later by converting RoBees and a few Hot Shoppe locations .",
      "Over the years , Marriotts company interests expanded . Continuing with food services , Marriott eventually became involved with airline in-flight food service . This segment of their enterprise continues to be a large part of their business , providing food services to many major airlines .",
      "In 1976 , Marriott opened two theme parks called Marriotts Great America in California and Illinois . Another was planned for in Maryland but local opposition prevented construction from ever beginning at any of the three proposed sites . The parks had replicas of the first Hot Shoppes . Both parks were sold in the mid-1980s , the one in California was sold to the city of Santa Clara , California and the one in Illinois was sold to Six Flags in 1984 . They are both renamed Californias Great America and Six Flags Great America , respectively .",
      "In 1982 , the company acquired Host International for $120 million and also Ginos Inc. , the owner of Ginos Hamburgers and Rustler Steak House restaurant chains , for $48.6 million . 108 Rustler Steak House Restaurants plus three other restaurants were sold in the following year to two different firms for undisclosed amounts . Newly formed Tenly Enterprises purchased 94 restaurants while Sizzler Restaurants International purchased the remaining 17 .",
      "By 1984 , Marriott had formed a vacation time-share division , now called Marriott Vacation Club International , through the purchase of American Resorts Group for an undisclosed amount and also a senior-living division .",
      "In 1985 , the company purchased the Howard Johnsons restaurant chain from the Imperial Group P.L.C . of London for $314 million with plans of converting the acquired restaurants to the Bobs Big Boy brand and to make Bobs the largest coffee-shop business in the country .",
      "In 1987 , Marriott sold the Big Boy restaurants franchise rights to Elias Brothers for an undisclosed amount while keeping 208 company-owned Bobs Big Boy restaurants in California and selected locations on the East Coast .",
      "In 1988 , Marriott purchased all 91 Wags restaurants from Walgreens Corporation , but dissolved the chain in 1991 .",
      "The Roy Rogers chain was sold to Hardees in 1990 for $365 million in cash .",
      "The Marriott Corporation ended its existence as a single company in 1993 , when it was split into two separate entities : 1 ) Marriott International Corporation , which operated the hotel and lodging aspect of the business and Marriott Vacation Club International , and 2 ) Host Marriott Corporation , the new name for the original Marriott Corporation and operating the Marriott Food Services Management . The last Hot Shoppes restaurant , located in the Marlow Heights Shopping Center , closed on December 2 , 1999 ."

      "The Allegory of Faith",
      "The Allegory of Faith , also known as Allegory of the Catholic Faith , is a Dutch Golden Age painting by Johannes Vermeer from about 1670\u20131672 . It has been in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 1931 .",
      "This and Art of Painting are his only works that fall under history painting in the contemporary hierarchy of genres , though they still have his typical composition of one or two figures in a domestic interior . Both share several features : the perspective is almost the same , and there is a multicolor tapestry at the left of each painting , pulled to the left to disclose the scene . The Art of Painting also uses symbolism from Cesare Ripa of Clio , muse of history . Vermeers Love Letter uses a similar gilt panel . The Allegory and The Art of Painting differ markedly in style and purpose from Vermeers other works .",
      "Description .",
      "The painting depicts a woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings . She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor , her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up , adoringly , at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon . Her left arm rests on the edge of a table which holds a golden chalice , a large book , and a dark-wood crucifix . Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen . Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth , possibly a priests stole . Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns . All of these items are on the platform , which is covered by a green and yellow rug , the edge of which is on the floor . At the bottom of the picture , nearer the viewer , is an apple , and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone . On the dim , far wall behind the woman , a large painting of Christs crucifixion is hung . To the viewers left is a multicolored tapestry , pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer . A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone .",
      "Iconography .",
      "From Cesare Ripas Iconologia .",
      "Vermeers iconography in the painting is largely taken from Cesare Ripas Iconologia , an emblem book ( a collection of allegorical illustrations with accompanying morals or poems on a moral theme ) which had been translated into Dutch in 1644 by D . P . Pers . The artist used various symbols that Ripa described and illustrated in his book , along with symbols taken from other books and traditions . Two of the four allegorical figures of Faith ( Fede . Geloof and Fede Catholica . Catholijck of algemeen Geloof ) given in Ripas book provide many of the symbols in the painting , including the color of the womans clothing , her hand gesture , and the presence of the crushed snake and the apple .",
      "In his book , Ripa states that Faith is the most important of the virtues . One image in the book shows her as a woman , dressed in white ( signifying light and purity ) and blue ( which relates to heaven , as Ripa states in another text ) . Faiths hand on her breast symbolizes that the virtue rests in her heart . Christ is represented in the cornerstone crushing the snake ( a symbol of the Devil ) , and the apple ( the fruit Eve gave to Adam ) represents original sin , which in Christian doctrine required the sacrifice of the Saviour . Ripa describes Faith as having the world under her feet , and Vermeer used the symbol quite literally , showing a globe of the earth under the womans right foot . ( The globe , with its distinctive cartouche ( decorative label ) has been identified as one made by Hendrick Hondius ) .",
      "From other sources .",
      "The crucifix , painting of the Crucifixion and the glass orb are not mentioned by Ripa , and Vermeer changed some of the iconography that Ripa gave : Instead of Ripas suggestion that Faith hold the chalice and rest her hand on a book , Vermeer put them on the table next to her . According to Arthur Wheelock , a University of Maryland academic and curator of a Vermeer exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington , this is an assemblage that gives the image a Eucharistic character not found in the text . By putting the golden chalice against the dark background of the paintings frame and the dark crucifix against the gilt-leather backdrop , the elements are given a greater prominence in the painting . Wheelock , citing his fellow academic at the University of Maryland , Quint Gregory , believes the slight overlapping of the chalice and the gold backdrop of the crucifix may symbolically suggest the essential role of the Eucharist in bridging the physical and spiritual realms , a very Catholic idea . Selena Cant calls the fact that the book , chalice and crucifix together represent the Catholic Mass .",
      "The pose of the woman ( hand on heart and eyes raised ) is similar to Ripas image of Theology . The pose was uncommon in Dutch art , but Vermeer was considered an expert in Italian painting , in which the image was often used ( especially those of Guido Reni [ 1575\u20131642 ] , whose works were then owned in Holland ) . Wheelock believes the large book , which has a metal clasp , is a Bible , but the Metropolitan Museum of Art states on its website that the volume may be the Catholic Missale Romanum .",
      "The paintings iconography is not only Catholic , but some believe it is strongly influenced by Jesuit ideas . Departing from Ripas allusion to the story of Abraham and Isaac ( an Old Testament story said to prefigure the faithful sacrifice of Christ on the Cross ) , Vermeer instead uses an image of the Crucifixion itself \u2014 an image dear to the Jesuits . Vermeer used Crucifixion , a painting from about 1620 by Jacob Jordaens ( 1593\u20131678 ) . The painter may have owned a copy of the painting . ( This may be the large painting representing Christ on the Cross described in an inventory of his household at his death . Two other items in the inventory may be in this painting : the gold-tooled leather on the wall of his homes kitchen , and an ebony wood crucifix ) .",
      "Another Jesuit influence in the painting is said to be the glass orb on which the woman sets her eyes . According to Eddy De Johgh , Vermeer appears to have taken it from a 1636 emblem book by the Jesuit Willem Hesius , Emblemata sacra de fide , spe , charitate . In the emblem , Capit Quod Non Capit , a winged boy , a symbol of the soul , is shown holding a sphere reflecting a nearby cross and the sun . In a poem accompanying the emblem , Hesius states that the spheres ability to reflect the world is similar to the minds ability to believe in God . Selena Cant has written that the sphere is symbol of the human mind and its capacity both to reflect and to contain infinity .",
      "The womans pearl necklace probably relates to pearls as ancient symbols of virginity , according to Cant . There is no source for the light on her dress , perhaps indicating that she is lit by an inner illumination \u2014 a strong indication to the viewer that she is not to be considered an individual , but a symbol , according to Walter Liedtke .",
      "Reception .",
      "Many art historians have considered the painting one of Vermeers less successful works . Cant , for instance , calls it harder , more brittle , less convincing . Faith herself appears uncomfortable : finely dressed , she appears too worldly to be a spiritual symbol , too solid to appear transported , the intimacy too forced and her expression too artificial .",
      "According to Wheelock , [ T ] he iconographic demands of this subject strained the credibility of his realistic approach . While essential for the paintings symbolic content , the ecstatic pose of the woman and the crushed snake seem incongruous within this Dutch setting . Walter Liedtke objected to Wheelocks point by asserting that the artist took a very realistic approach primarily in depicting the terrestrial globe and reflections in the glass sphere . Instead , according to Liedtke , the painting is best compared to contemporary Dutch paintings illustrating abstract concepts , including Adriaen Hannemans Allegory of the Peace ( 1664 ; still in situ at the Eerste Kamer in the Binnenhof ) , a histrionic picture showing how reticent Vermeer was in this work ; and Karel Dujardins Allegory of the Immortal Fame of Art Vanquishing Time and Envy ( 1675 ; Historisches Museum , Bamberg ) ; Gabriel Metsus The Triumph of Justice ( late 1650s ; Mauritshuis , The Hague ) ; Adriaen van de Veldes The Annunciation ( 1667 ; Rijksmuseum , Amsterdam ) as well as works by Van Honthorst and early works of De Lairesse .",
      "Provenance .",
      "Vermeers imaginative use of symbolism in the painting indicates to Wheelock that the painter was not given specific instructions on the allegory but chose the various items himself . The original owner is unknown but may have been a Catholic in Delft , possibly the Jesuits in the city . The Metropolitan Museum of Art website states , This late work was surely commissioned , probably by a patron who was learned as well as devout .",
      "The painting was one of those apparently not among the 21 works by the artist collection of Vermeers main patron , Pieter Claesz van Ruijven ( 1624\u20131674 ) , and auctioned off in the Dissius sale of 1696 . Its first known owner was Herman Stoffelsz van Swoll ( 1632\u20131698 ) , a postmaster and a Protestant . That Swoll was familiar with collecting art is indicated by the fact that the best man at his wedding in 1656 was a famous collector , Gerrit Reynst . The year after Swolls death , in 1699 , the painting was auctioned off in Amsterdam along with other works in Swolls collection ( which included Italian works ) . The sale catalogue described the work as A sitting Woman with deep meanings , depicting the New Testament , and also stated , powerfully and glowingly painted . After spending time in an unknown collection , the painting ( described as depicting the New Testament ) was auctioned off in 1718 , again in Amsterdam . It was auctioned again in 1735 ( described as artfully and minutely painted ) , and in the Ietswaart sale of 1749 ( described as as good as Eglon van der Neer ) . The mixed fortunes of Vermeers reputation in the 18th century can be seen in the prices paid for the painting at these various auctions : f 400 in 1699 ; f500 in 1718 ; f53 in 1735 ; f70 in 1749 ) .",
      "By the early 19th century the painting apparently had found its way to Austria , where it was depicted in the background of Portrait of a Cartographer and His Wife by Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller in 1824 ( now in Westf\u00e4lisches Landesmuseum , M\u00fcnster ) . Atlases depicted in this painting contain maps primarily of Vorarlberg and Tirol at the western end of Austria , so perhaps the painting was in that area , according to Wheelock . At the end of the century , the painting ( at that time mistakenly attributed to Eglon van der Neer ) was part of the collection of Ilya Ostroukhov ( and later Dmitry Shchukin ) in Moscow , making it the fourth Vermeer owned by Russians at that time . In 1899 it was put up for sale by a dealer , W\u00e4chtler , in Berlin . That year Abraham Bredius bought it for about DM 700 . A Dutch newspaper at the time praised Bredius for the purchase : With this acquisition of the new Delft Vermeer , the New Testament , as an Eglon van der Neer , Dr . Bredius has once again found a bargain with his perspicacious eye . Bredius then loaned the work to the Mauritshuis , where it remained for the next 24 years , until 1923 when Bredius gave it to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam for a long-term loan .",
      "Bredius disliked the work , calling it ( in 1907 ) a large but unpleasant Vermeer . In 1928 , he sold it through the dealer Kleinberger to Michael Friedsam in New York , who bequeathed it in 1931 as part of the Friedsam Collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , where it has remained .",
      "Exhibitions .",
      "The painting has been loaned by The Met to a number of exhibitions that included multiple Vermeers being brought together from different museums . Amongst these were :",
      "- \u201dVermeer . Il secolo d\u2019oro dell\u2019arte olandese\u201d at le Scuderie del Quirinale in Rome , which opened on September 27 , 2012 and ran through January 20 , 2013",

      "Atlanta Dream",
      "The Atlanta Dream is an American professional basketball team based in Atlanta , Georgia , playing in the Eastern Conference in the Womens National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) . The team was founded for the 2008 WNBA season . The team is owned by real estate investors Larry Gottesdiener , Suzanne Abair and former Dream player Renee Montgomery . Although the Dream share the Atlanta market with the National Basketball Associations Hawks , the Dream is not affiliated with its NBA counterpart . The Dream play at the Gateway Center Arena in College Park , Georgia .",
      "The Dream has qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in nine of its 12 years in Atlanta and has reached the WNBA Finals three times . The franchise has been home to many high-quality players such as University of Louisville standouts Angel McCoughtry and Shoni Schimmel , former Finals MVP Betty Lennox , and Brazilian sharpshooter Izi Castro Marques . In 2010 , the Dream went to the WNBA Finals but fell short to Seattle . They lost to the Minnesota Lynx in the 2011 and 2013 WNBA Finals .",
      "Franchise history .",
      "Even before the success of the United States womens basketball team in the 1996 Olympic Games , the American Basketball League had interest in placing a womens professional basketball team in Atlanta as early as 1995 . Eight of the twelve Olympians played on ABL teams when the league began play in October 1996 . The Atlanta Glory played at Forbes Arena and lasted two seasons before folding before the start of the 1998\u201399 season , which would be the ABLs final .",
      "Atlanta had been mentioned as a possible future city for WNBA expansion , but efforts did not come together until the beginning of 2007 when an organizing committee with Atlanta businessmen and politicians began the effort to attract an expansion team . The inability of the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA to draw crowds was a concern of the WNBA , and the committee kicked off an effort in February 2007 to gain volunteers and petition signatures . Philips Arena ( now State Farm Arena ) , the Gwinnett Arena ( now Infinite Energy Arena ) and Alexander Memorial Coliseum ( now McCamish Pavilion ) were candidates for venues . By May 2007 , the committee had over 1,000 pledges for season tickets , although the goal was 8,000 season tickets in ninety days . By July the committee had 1,200 commitments and began searching for an owner .",
      "On October 16 , 2007 , it was reported that Ron Terwilliger , an Atlanta businessman and CEO of a national real estate company would be the future owner of an Atlanta franchise . The next day , at a news conference at Atlantas Centennial Olympic Park , WNBA president Donna Orender made the announcement that Atlanta would officially be granted a WNBA expansion franchise .",
      "On November 27 , 2007 , Atlanta named Marynell Meadors , a coach with extensive experience at the college level , the first head coach and general manager in franchise history . This was Meadors second role as a coach/general manager in the WNBA following a stint with the Charlotte Sting . Afterwards , Meadors had served as a scouting director for the Miami Sol and had been an assistant coach under Richie Adubato and Tree Rollins for the Washington Mystics . Former NBA player Dennis Rodman volunteered his name as head coach for the Dream . Terwilliger declined , stating that he wanted someone with more coaching experience and he felt that the head coach should be a woman , as the WNBA was a womens league .",
      "On December 5 , 2007 , an online contest was announced for people to vote on the team name and team colors , while the final choice rested with owner Ron Terwilliger . The names offered as choices were Dream , Flight , Surge and Sizzle . There were also options for team colors such as lime green or hot pink . On January 23 , 2008 , the team name was announced as the Dream , inspired by the famous speech of Atlanta native Martin Luther King Jr. , and the team colors were sky blue , red , and white .",
      "Atlanta held their expansion draft on February 6 , 2008 when they selected one player from each of the 13 teams in the league . Atlanta traded Roneeka Hodges and their number four pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft to the Seattle Storm for Izi Castro Marques and Seattles eighth pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft . Also , the Dream traded the 18th pick and LaToya Thomas to the Detroit Shock for Ivory Latta .",
      "From May 17 , 2008 , with a season opening loss against the Connecticut Sun to July 3 , 2008 , with a home loss against the Houston Comets , the Dream lost 17 consecutive games , setting the WNBA all-time record for both consecutive losses and losses from opening day . The 2006 Chicago Sky had previously lost 13 consecutive games , and the 2002 Detroit Shock had opened their season 0\u201313 . On July 5 , the Dream earned their first win in Atlanta 91\u201384 against the Chicago Sky , ending the losing streak . They later finished with a 4\u201330 record .",
      "Not wanting a repeat of 2008 , head coach and general manager Marynell Meadors acquired players such as Sancho Lyttle , Nikki Teasley , Chamique Holdsclaw , Angel McCoughtry , and Michelle Snow in the 2008\u20132009 offseason . In 2009 , Atlanta reached the playoffs at 18\u201316 , exceeding their previous record by 14 wins , but lost in the first round to the 2008 champion Detroit Shock in a sweep . After the season , their coach , Marynell Meadors , was awarded the Coach of the Year Award .",
      "The Dreams owner , Ron Terwilliger , announced in August that he wanted to give up his position as the primary owner of the Atlanta franchise . On October 29 , 2009 , Kathy Betty took control of the team under the business entity Dream Too , LLC .",
      "The 2010 season saw further improvement , finishing in fourth place in the Eastern Conference . The Dream then made it through the first two rounds of the playoffs and secured a trip to the WNBA Finals with a win over the New York Liberty , as they swept New York in two games in the Eastern Conference Finals . They eventually faced the best team in the league , the 28\u20136 Seattle Storm . Seattle took the first two games at home with two close wins . Seattle completed the sweep and won the series in Atlanta . Even though they were swept , the Dream did not lose any game by a margin of more than three points .",
      "Addressing arguably Atlantas biggest concern , the team traded for All-Star point guard Lindsey Harding prior to the 2011 season . Despite the addition , the Dream struggled to open the season , starting with a 2\u20137 record due to an injury that sidelined Angel McCoughtry and overseas commitments by Sancho Lyttle . The team then went on a run of 14 wins and 5 losses after the All-Star break . They carried that momentum into the playoffs , sweeping the Connecticut Sun and defeating the Indiana Fever to return to the WNBA Finals . However , they lost to the 27\u20137 Minnesota Lynx in three games .",
      "During the 2011 season , Betty sold Dream Too LLC to local investors Mary Brock and Kelly Loeffler .",
      "The Dream started the 2012 season with a 12\u201312 record and fired head coach and general manager Meadors during a dispute with league-leading scorer Angel McCoughtry . Meadors was replaced by Fred Williams , finished with a 19\u201315 record , and lost in the first round .",
      "The following 2013 season , the team again made it to the WNBA Finals , and again were swept by the Lynx . Williams contract was not renewed .",
      "Michael Cooper was then hired for the 2014 season . He led the team to the playoffs in 2014 and 2016 , but was fired after failing to make the playoffs in 2017 .",
      "On October 18 , 2019 , the Dream unveiled an updated logo and color scheme , the first change to their branding since the teams inception in 2008 .",
      "Shortly after the George Floyd protests began , the WNBA and players union decided to put Black Lives Matter and Say Her Name slogans on warmup gear and opening weekend uniforms . By then , team owner Kelly Loeffler was a Republican U.S . Senator , and she criticized the leagues support for Black Lives Matter . At the next game , Dream players wore black T-shirts with the slogan VOTE WARNOCK , endorsing her election opponent Raphael Warnock , an African-American pastor who then defeated Loeffler . The players union then demanded that Loeffler sell her stake in the team . A three-member investor group , including former Atlanta Dream guard Renee Montgomery , were approved to purchase the team in February 2021 .",
      "Home arena .",
      "The Dream played at Philips Arena , now known as State Farm Arena , in downtown Atlanta , shared with the Atlanta Hawks from 2008 to 2016 . In 2013 , the team qualified for the WNBA Finals , but a scheduling conflict forced them to play home games at The Arena at Gwinnett Center , now known as Infinite Energy Arena , in suburban Duluth . Due to renovations to Philips Arena during the Hawks 2017 and 2018 offseasons , the Dream played home games at McCamish Pavilion on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology .",
      "The team returned to the renovated and renamed State Farm Arena for the 2019 season . Following the conclusion of the 2019 WNBA regular season , team officials indicated that the Dream would not be returning to State Farm Arena for the 2020 season , citing disagreements with the Hawks management . The team announced on October 18 , 2019 , coinciding with their rebranding , they would move to the new Gateway Center Arena in nearby College Park for the 2020 season ( later delayed to the 2021 season ) , sharing the arena with the Hawks NBA G League affiliate , the College Park Skyhawks .",

      "Strike Fighter Squadron 94 ( VFA-94 ) , also known as the Mighty Shrikes , is a United States Navy fighter squadron stationed at Naval Air Station Lemoore . It is an operational fleet squadron currently flying the F/A-18F Super Hornet . It is attached to Carrier Air Wing 17 ( CVW 17 ) and based at NAS Lemoore , California . Its tail code is NA and its radio call sign is Hobo .",
      "Insignia and nickname .",
      "The original squadron was known as the Tough Kitties and had a cartoon cat insignia . When the second squadron was formed and deployed aboard during its world cruise in 1954 , it also used a cartoon cat insignia . There is no record of this insignia being officially approved for use by the squadron . The squadron\u2019s first official insignia was approved by Chief of Naval Operations on 21 November 1955 , and consisted of a yellow and black tiger paw with lightning bolts on a blue background . A new insignia was approved on 21 April 1959 consisting of a dark blue stylized aircraft with above an atom symbol on a blue background . A modification to this insignia was approved on 16 May 1967 , replacing the atom symbol by a stylized bird design . The stylized bird was orange and the other colors from the previous design stayed the same .",
      "Nicknamed the Mighty Shrikes , the squadron was named after a small carnivorous bird of prey , the loggerhead shrike . It engages in aerial combat to strike its prey in the air and on the ground , and then impales its victim on a sharp thorn .",
      "History .",
      "Two distinct US Navy squadrons have held the designation VA-94 . The first VA-94 served in World War II and was disestablished on 30 November 1949 . The second VA-94 later became VFA-94 , the main subject of this article . Officially , the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage of newly formed squadrons with disestablished squadrons . Often however , the new squadron will assume the nickname , insignia , and traditions of the earlier squadrons . That appears to have happened in this case , as ( for a short time ) the new squadron used a cat insignia similar to the earlier one .",
      "1950s .",
      "Fighter Squadron 94 ( VF-94 ) was established at NAS Alameda , California on March 26 , 1952 . The squadron began flying the Vought F4U Corsair , but quickly transitioned to jet aircraft .

On 7 February 1965 , following a Viet Cong attack against American advisors in South Vietnam , President Lyndon Johnson ordered a reprisal strike against North Vietnam , named Flaming Dart I . The squadron\u2019s target was concealed by heavy weather and the mission was aborted . On 11 February , the squadron participated in Flaming Dart II , retaliatory strikes against the Chanh Hoa military barracks near Dong Hoi , North Vietnam . In March 1965 , the squadron participated in Rolling Thunder strikes against targets in North Vietnam .",

The first mine was dropped at 08:59 to coincide with President Richard Nixons public announcement of the mining . All mines were set with 72-hour arming delays , thus permitting merchant ships time for departure or a change in destination consistent with the Presidents public warning . It was the beginning of a mining campaign that planted over 11,000 MK36 type destructor and 108 special Mk 52-2 mines over the next eight months .",
      "In 1973 , the squadron deployed on its first peacetime cruise in a decade , again with Carrier Air Wing 15 aboard USS Coral Sea .",

In May 1991 , it deployed aboard to the Persian Gulf in support of United Nations sanctions following the war in Iraq . The squadron also participated in Operation Fiery Vigil , evacuating thousands of homeless people from the Philippines after the Mount Pinatubo eruption . It subsequently received the Joint Meritorious Unit Commendation for its contribution to the disaster relief efforts .",
      "On 15 June 1993 , the squadron deployed aboard USS Abraham Lincoln flying missions over southern Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch . In October 1993 , USS Abraham Lincoln left the Persian Gulf for Somalia to provide force protection for U.S . and other United Nations forces aiding in the humanitarian relief effort .

      "The Richmond Kickers are an American professional soccer club based in Richmond , Virginia . Founded in 1993 , the Kickers are the oldest continuously run professional soccer clubs in the United States , along with the Charleston Battery . After following the United Soccer League into the second division for 2017 and 2018 , the Kickers returned to the third tier of American soccer in 2019 as a founding member of USL League One .",
      "The teams home field is City Stadium , where the club has played since 1995 . The teams chairman is Robert Ukrop , a Richmond native and former Kickers player .",
      "History .",
      "1993\u20132019 .",
      "The Richmond Kickers were founded in 1993 and played their inaugural season in the United States Interregional Soccer League ( USISL ) , which , at the time , represented the third division of the American soccer pyramid . The team originally played their home matches on the campus of the University of Richmond and targeted players specifically from Virginia . After a poor season in 1994 , the club self-relegated to the newly formed fourth-tier USISL Premier League , now known as the USL League Two . During the 1995 season , the Kickers battled to a 15\u20133 winning season and went on to win the first ever USISL Premier League championship , defeating the now-defunct Cocoa Expos in the championship . That same season , Richmond won their only , Lamar Hunt U.S . Open Cup championship . The following year , Richmond chose to rejoin the third division , where they reached the USISL Select League championship , only to lose to the California Jaguars in the finals .",
      "For the next nine seasons , Richmond played in the second tier of the American soccer pyramid , earning the Commissioners Cup twice , in 1998 and 2001 , as well as earning two conference championships . However , the club was never able to secure a division two league championship , their closest coming in 2005 , when the Kickers fell to the Seattle Sounders in the 2005 USL First Division Championship . After the 2005 season , the Kickers ownership self-relegated the team back into the third division , citing possible financial problems for the club if they remained in the second tier . Since joining the third division , the Kickers have had tremendous success , making it to at least the playoff semifinals each season they have played in the third division . Additionally , the Kickers have won two third division premierships and two third division championships during their spell .",
      "In September 2005 , the club retired Rob Ukrops #6 jersey . Ukrop played for the inaugural 1993 Kickers and the 1995 U.S . Open Cup team , joined the New England Revolution at the launch of Major League Soccer before returning midway through the 1996 season to play out his career in his hometown .",
      "Richmond Kickers have not only experienced league success , but have been perennial contenders in the Lamar Hunt U.S . Open Cup tournament . In the 2007 U.S . Open Cup , the Kickers defeated the Los Angeles Galaxy of the first division , Major League Soccer , 1\u20130 in the third round of competition . The Kickers won their First Round match of the 2008 U.S . Open Cup , beating the Fredericksburg Gunners of the PDL with a final scoreline of 3\u20130 . The Kickers won their second-round game over the Western Mass Pioneers 2\u20131 before being eliminated from the Cup in the third round by MLS side , and defending USOC champion , New England Revolution , 3\u20130 . In the 2011 US Open Cup the Kickers made a Cinderella run , defeating MLS clubs Columbus Crew and Sporting Kansas City to reach the semi-finals , before falling to the Chicago Fire .",
      "The Kickers briefly sponsored two developmental teams of their own : Richmond Kickers Future and Richmond Kickers Destiny . Future played in the mens USL Premier Development League from 2002 to 2008 , while the Destiny played in the womens USL W-League from 2004 to 2009 . The Kickers entered a multi-year deal to become the USL Pro affiliate of D.C . United in 2013 , and continued that affiliation through 2018 .

It is considered one of the less technical 7000 m peaks in the world to climb and it has by far the most ascents of any 7000 m or higher peak on Earth , with every year seeing hundreds of mountaineers make their way to the summit . Lenin Peak is the highest mountain in the Trans-Alay Range of Central Asia , and in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan it is exceeded only by Ismoil Somoni Peak ( 7,495 m ) . It was thought to be the highest point in the Pamirs in Tajikistan until 1933 , when Ismoil Somoni Peak ( known as Stalin Peak at the time ) was climbed and found to be more than 300 metres higher . Two mountains in the Pamirs in China , Kongur Tagh ( 7,649 m ) and Muztagh Ata ( 7,546 m ) , are higher than the Tajik summits .",
      "Names .",
      "The peak was discovered in 1871 and originally named Mount Kaufmann after Konstantin Kaufman , the first Governor-General of Turkestan . In 1928 , the mountain was renamed Lenin Peak after the Russian revolutionary and first leader of the Soviet Union , Vladimir Lenin . In Tajikistan , the peak was renamed again in July 2006 , and today it is officially called in Tajik Qullai Abuali ibni Sino ( \u049b\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0438 \u0410\u0431\u04ef\u0430\u043b\u04e3 \u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u0438\u043d\u043e , Ibn Sina Peak or , alternatively , Avicenna Peak ) after Abu Ali ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) .",
      "In Kyrgyzstan , the peak is still officially called Lenin Chokusu ( \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0427\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0443 , Lenin Peak ) . However , in October 2017 , Kyrgyz president Almazbek Atambayev called for renaming the peak Manas Peak , after the hero of the Epic of Manas . A peak named Manas Peak already exists in Kyrgyzstan ; it is a mountain of in the Talas Alatau range in Talas Region .",
      "Local Kyrgyz names include Jel-Aidar ( Winds God ) and Achyk-Tash ( Open Rock ) . Achik-Tash , is also the name of a plateau and a base camp at an elevation of 3,600 m on a popular northern climbing route to Lenin Peak , which starts in the southern Kyrgyz city of Osh , a days drive north of the border . Another suggested local name , Pik Kaman ( wild pig , boar ) probably belongs to an officially unnamed peak west of Lenin Peak .",
      "Climbing history and routes .",
      "Initial exploration of this part of Central Asia occurred in the period 1774\u201382 . Arguably the first recorded travel through the region is the involuntary journey of the slave Filipp Efremov ( an ethnic Russian ) , who escaped from slavery in Bukhara . He crossed the Fergana valley , then via Osh , the Chigirik Pass and Terekdavan Pass he reached the Kashgar and finally came over the Karakorum . He was the first European who crossed the Alai Mountains .",
      "Scientific expeditions to the Alai Mountains began in 1871 , when Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko discovered the Trans-Alai ( Zaalayskiy ) Range and its main peak . The first geographical expedition which came nearest to the base of the future Lenin Peak in the early 20th century was arguably the expedition of Nikolai Leopoldovich Korzhenevskiy .",
      "In September 1928 , three mountaineers -the Germans and Karl Wien , and the Austrian - from the Soviet-German scientific expedition , made the first attempt to reach the highest point of the Trans-Alai Range , which at that time had the name Kaufman Peak .",
      "They started climbing upstream of the Saukdara river along the South slope of Trans-Alai Range also Trans-Alay Range . From the river head they continued climbing along the Greater Saukdara Glacier towards a saddle at an elevation of 5820 m ( this saddle is also known as the Krilenko Pass ) . On September 25 , 1928 they started climbing from the saddle along the NE Ridge and at 15.30 they reached the summit . At the time , Kaufman Peak was the highest summit reached by men .",
      "The title Lenin Peak was first applied to the highest point of the Trans-Alai Range in the same year ( 1928 ) . When it was renamed after Lenin it was believed to be the highest point in the USSR .",
      "On September 8 , 1934 , at 16:20 Kasian Chernuha , Vitaly Abalakov and Ivan Lukin , three members of a Soviet expedition , reached the summit at an elevation of . Their attempt lasted for four days with three camps ( 5700 m , 6500 m and 7000 m ) . The expedition started climbing from the Achik-Tash canyon in the Alai valley . The summit attempt itself was started along the Western ice slope of the Lenin glacier . They continued climbing along the North Face , passing the rocks that were later given the name Lipkins Rocks . At the end of the second day they reached the crest of the NE ridge at an elevation of about 6500 m . During the following day and a half they climbed along the NE Ridge and , utterly exhausted , reached the summit .",
      "The third ascent was three years later , in 1937 , when eight Soviet climbers under the direction of Lev Barkhash reached the summit by the same route . This was at the beginning of mass political repressions in the Soviet Union and many of the most prominent Soviet climbers , including Lev Barkhash , were brought to trial .",
      "Subsequent attempts to climb Lenin Peak could not begin until 1950 , when the USSR began to recover from the Second World War . On August 14 , 1950 , twelve climbers ( V . Aksenov , K , Zaporojchenko , Y . Izrael , V . Kovalev , A . Kormshikov , Y . Maslov , E . Nagel , V . Narishkin , V . Nikonov , V . Nozdryuhin , I . Rojkov ) under the direction of Vladimir Racek reached the summit for the fourth time .",
      "All three Soviet expeditions including Racecs expedition of 1950 were by almost the same route via the NE Ridge .",
      "The route which now is known as the classic route , via the Razdelnaya Peak and NW Ridge , was first climbed in 1954 by the team of Soviet climbers under the direction of V . Kovalev ( P . Karpov , E . Nagel , V . Narishkin , V . Nozdryuhin ) .",
      "In 1960 , a group of eight Soviet climbers made a successful direct climb along the North Face ( 15.08.1960 ) .",
      "There are 16 established routes , nine on the southern side and seven on the northern slopes . The peak is quite popular with climbers due to its easy access and some uncomplicated routes . However , the peak is not without its share of disasters . In 1974 , an entire team of eight female climbers died high on the mountain in a storm .",
      "The first high-speed ascent of Lenin Peak was completed in 1987 . The team , led by Valery Khrichtchatyi , included G . Lunyakov , Z . Khalitov , Anatoli Boukreev , V . Suviga , Y . Moiseev and A . Tselischev . The climb beginning from ABC base camp ( 4400 m ) to the summit and return to ABC base camp took 12 hours .",
      "Under the leadership of Leonid Troshchinenko the team , composed of 19 mountaineers from Leningrad and three from Kazakhstan , made the first winter ascent of Lenin Peak in 1988 . With temperatures hovering at -45\u00b0 C , only six men reached the summit : including Valery Khrichtchatyi , Balyberdin , S . Arsentiev , U . Moiseev , I . Tulaiev and V . Dedi .",
      "In 1987 The first solo ascent was achieved by the great high altitude mountaineer Anatoli Boukreev . An avalanche triggered by an earthquake killed 43 climbers in 1990 .",
      "As it is now , considering the existing infrastructure and BC/ABC locations , there are three most attractive routes from the North ( approximately indicated on the Scheme ) : Lipkins rocks route and NE Ridge ; the classic North Face route ; the route via Razdelnaya Peak and the NW Ridge .",

      "Statue of Queen Victoria , Sydney",
      "The Statue of Queen Victoria , currently in Sydney , New South Wales , Australia , was made by John Hughes in 1908 and was originally located in Dublin . Made of bronze , it is situated on the corner of Druitt and George Street in front of the Queen Victoria Building . It was the last royal statue to have been erected in Ireland .",
      "Sculpture .",
      "The Queen toured Ireland in April 1900 , prompting the Royal Dublin Society to propose a national monument to her . Her death nine months later spurred a second burst of enthusiasm . John Hughes , instructor in Modelling at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art , was commissioned to create the statue and moved his studio to Paris to cast the work . It was his most important commission to date . Almost a decade later , it was unveiled in Dublin , Ireland , in the enclosed courtyard of Leinster House on 17 February 1908 . At a ceremony with 1000 troops on parade , the Lord Lieutenant declared we are assembled here to dedicate this noble work of art to the perpetual commemoration of a great personality and a great life .",
      "The statue shows an effort to portray Victoria Regina as the Irish Queen rather than the British Sovereign . She is seated in a low chair rather than an elaborate throne , allowing the artist to contain the figure within a sphere rather than as a towering pillar . ( Other seated examples place her on a high throne. ) And she wears a simple coronet rather than the royal or imperial crown...Moreover , the statue portrayed her as the Sovereign Head of the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick , Irelands order of chivalry dating from 1783 . The star on her left breast , and the pendant badge , feature shamrocks , crowned harps , and St Patricks Cross . The St Patrick reference probably backfired . It confirmed Irelands colonial subordination . Round her neck the chain alternates the red and white roses of England .",
      "The statue sat atop a portland stone column , also designed by Hughes , with three sculptural groups to be placed below \u2013 Fame , Hibernia at Peace and Hibernia at War . This last group was also known as Erin and the Dying Soldier and referred to the loyalty demonstrated by Irish soldiers in the Boer War .",
      "Location .",
      "Ireland .",
      "In 1922 , 14 years after the statues installation , Leinster House had become the seat of the Irish parliament , the Oireachtas , and nationalistic sentiment disapproved of having a British queen celebrated in such a location . The statue had by now been given the nickname The auld bitch by Irish writer James Joyce . In August 1929 The Irish Times reported that discussions were under way to remove the statue \u201con the basis that its continued presence there is repugnant to national feeling , and that , from an artistic point of view , it disfigures the architectural beauty of the parliamentary buildings.\u201d",
      "It was removed from its original location in July 1948 and replaced with a carpark . It was transported by lorry to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and , along with the associated three sculptural groups , was placed in a courtyard and left , developing a patina . The hospital had also been a proposed site for the parliament , and was used as a storage location for property belonging to the National Museum of Ireland . It is now the Irish Museum of Modern Art . Attempts to send the sculpture to London , Ontario did not succeed as neither the Canadian nor Irish governments wished to pay the cost of transport . In February 1980 the statue was transferred to a yard behind a disused childrens reformatory at Daingean , County Offaly .",
      "The associated sculptures from the base of the statue are currently in the collection of Dublin Castle .",
      "Australia .",
      "In the mid-1980s , the iconic Queen Victoria Building in central Sydney was undergoing major renovations after decades of disuse , and appropriate public art was being sought for the entrance . Neil Glasser , Director of Promotions for the company undertaking the renovations ( Singapores Ipoh Gardens Ltd ) , travelled to several former British colonies in the hope of finding a statue . After a considerable amount of sleuthing , the statue , sitting in long grass behind the reformatory , was rediscovered and proposed to be moved to Australia . In order to obtain approval , Glasser contacted John Teahan , the Director of the National Museum of Ireland , and Sydneys Lord Mayor contacted the Irish Ambassador in Canberra . In August 1986 Fine Gael Taoiseach , Garret FitzGerald , authorised that the statue be given to Australia on loan until recalled . Subsequently , declassified cabinet papers showed that the plan was opposed by the then finance minister John Bruton ( later to be Taoiseach ) , as well as Teahan , on the basis that it represented the work of an Irish artist and ...representative of one of the many traditions of Irish history .",
      "The statue was transported by sea to Australia that year , restored in Sydney , and installed at its present location 43 years after it had last been on display . Despite heavy rain an unveiling ceremony took place on Sunday 20 December 1987 overseen by Eric Neal , Chief Commissioner of Sydney , and Dermot Brangan , first secretary at the Irish embassy to Australia . The irony of the British Queen being transported to Australia by ship was not lost on the Irish media . In the days before the unveiling the embassy and the Daily Telegraph newspaper received anonymous threats of violence and protest about the propriety of an Irish government giving a statue of Victoria as a gift .",
      "A second statue nearby is of the Queens favourite pet , a Skye Terrier named Islay , begging above a wishing well on behalf of the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children . At a cost of $10,000 , Sydney sculptor Justin Robson modelled the bronze work from an 1843 sketch by the Queen . The location of the statue is actually to disguise the ventilation shaft for the new carpark underneath the renovated building . The wishing well also includes a poem telling the story of Islay which will be specially translated into Braille , four proverbs highlighting the morality of giving in six different languages , and a piece of stone from Blarney Castle , Ireland . Since 1998 , a recorded request for donations , supposedly being spoken by Islay , has been played at regular intervals from hidden loudspeakers . The recording says , Because of the many good deeds Ive done for deaf and blind children , I have been given the power of speech , and then expresses thanks for donations . It is voiced by local radio personality John Laws and concludes with two barks , also by Laws ."

      "The Athen\u00e6um was a literary magazine published in London , England from 1828 to 1921 .",
      "Foundation .",
      "Initiated in 1828 by James Silk Buckingham , it was sold within a few weeks to Frederick Maurice and John Sterling , who failed to make it profitable . In 1829 , Charles Wentworth Dilke became part proprietor and editor ; he greatly extended the influence of the magazine . In 1846 , he resigned the editorship and assumed that of the Daily News of London , but contributed a series of notable articles to the Athenaeum . The poet and critic Thomas Kibble Hervey succeeded Dilke as editor and served from 1846 until his resignation due to ill health in 1853 . Historian and traveller William Hepworth Dixon succeeded Hervey in 1853 , and remained editor until 1869 .",
      "Contributors .",
      "George Darley was a staff critic during the early years , and Gerald Massey contributed many literary reviews \u2013 mainly on poetry \u2013 during the period 1858 to 1868 . Theodore Watts-Dunton contributed regularly as the principal critic of poetry from 1875 until 1898 . Frederic George Stephens was art editor from 1860 until 1901 , when he was replaced by Roger Fry because of his unfashionable disapproval of Impressionism ; Stephens continued to contribute book reviews and obituaries until 1904 . Arthur Symons joined the staff in 1891 .",
      "Editor from 1871 to 1900 was Norman MacColl . During the 19th century , the Athenaeum received contributions from Lord Kelvin . During the early 20th Century , its contributors included Max Beerbohm , Edmund Blunden , T . S . Eliot , Robert Graves , Thomas Hardy , Aldous Huxley , Julian Huxley , Katherine Mansfield , George Santayana , Edith Sitwell , and Virginia Woolf .",
      "From 1849 to 1880 Geraldine Jewsbury contributed more than 2300 reviews . She was one of very few women who reviewed for the Athenaeum and started submitting her reviews regularly by 1854 . She rated highly novels that showed character morality and were also entertaining . She criticized the fallen woman theme , which was common in Victorian literature . During the second half of the 1850s , Jewsbury was entrusted with editing the New Novels section .",
      "Legacy .",
      "A letter from J . S . Cotton , reportedly printed during 1905 , definitively tells of the first-ever reference to the playing of a match of cricket in India .",
      "In 1921 , with decreasing circulation , the Athenaeum was incorporated into its younger competitor : the Nation , becoming The Nation and Athenaeum . In 1931 , this successor publication merged with the New Statesman , to form the New Statesman and Nation , eliminating the name Athenaeum after 97 years .",

      "Exchange and Provost",
      "The Old Exchange & Provost Dungeon , also known as the Custom House , and The Exchange , is a historic building at East Bay and Broad Streets in Charleston , South Carolina , USA . Built in 1767\u20131771 , it has served a variety of civic institutional functions , including notably as a prisoner of war facility operated by British forces during the American Revolutionary War . The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973 . It is now a museum operated by the Daughters of the American Revolution .",
      "Description .",
      "The Old Exchange is located on the east side of Charlestons historic downtown area , at the northeast corner of East Bay and Broad Streets . It is a two-story masonry building , capped by a hipped roof with cupola and set on a high brick basement . The main facade faces west , and has a projecting three-bay gabled section at its center with entrances recessed in three round-arch openings on the first floor , and sash windows set in bays articulated by Ionic pilasters on the second . The flanking walls each have a Palladian window set on a brick base with balustrade .",
      "History .",
      "The Exchange was built from 1767\u20131771 by South Carolinas provincial government , and was used during the 18th century for a variety of civic functions , including as a custom house , public market , public meeting place , and jail . During the American Revolution , confiscated tea was stored here in 1774 , and it is where South Carolinas revolutionary leadership councils were held . After the British captured the city in 1780 , it was used as a barracks , and its basement was used as a military prison . In 2012 , a study was completed of the buildings use as a British prison during the Revolutionary War . Soon after taking control of Charleston in 1780 , the British started housing prisoners in the Exchange , but not exclusively in the dungeon . The investigation was able to document at least 120 prisoners held in the Exchange , but there were many more whose identities could not be discovered . The facility was not exclusively used for Colonial prisoners , and at least some British soldiers were held there too .",
      "The building housed the South Carolina convention to ratify the United States Constitution in 1788 , and was the site of many of the events in George Washingtons week-long stay in Charleston . He was greeted by a crowd on the balcony . The building continued as an Exchange until the 19th century , when it also became a post office . During the 19th century , the postmaster defended the Exchanges shipment of abolitionist pamphlets from angry Charlestonian rioters . In the American Civil War , the building remained a Confederate post office , but was hit by several shells during the war , and thus abandoned . In 1913 , the building was granted to the Daughters of the American Revolution , who have preserved it ever since . In World War I , the building served as the army headquarters of General Leonard Wood and the United States Lighthouse Service\u2014the latter having been in the building since the late 1800s . In World War II , the building not only served as a USO facility and canteen for troops , but served as the Coastal Picket Station for the Sixth Naval District of the United States Coast Guard . In 1965 , the Half-Moon Battery , a 1698 fortification , was discovered underneath the building .",
      "The buildings first cupola was damaged by a hurricane in the early 1800s . The second deteriorated before the great earthquake of 1886 , and the third was not placed until 1981 when the building opened as a museum .",
      "The building is owned by the South Carolina Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution , who operate guided costumed tours that include all three floors of the building . The Provost Dungeon once had animatronic figures that tell stories of pirates and colonial days , but these animatronics have been supplanted by personal dungeon tours by docents ."

      "Tommy Flowers",
      "Thomas Harold Flowers , BSc , DSc , OBE ( 22 December 1905 \u2013 28 October 1998 ) was an English engineer with the British General Post Office . During World War II , Flowers designed and built Colossus , the worlds first programmable electronic computer , to help solve encrypted German messages .",
      "Early life .",
      "Flowers was born at 160 Abbott Road , Poplar in Londons East End on 22 December 1905 , the son of a bricklayer .",
      "Whilst undertaking an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering at the Royal Arsenal , Woolwich , he took evening classes at the University of London to earn a degree in electrical engineering . In 1926 , he joined the telecommunications branch of the General Post Office ( GPO ) , moving to work at the research station at Dollis Hill in north-west London in 1930 . In 1935 , he married Eileen Margaret Green and the couple later had two children , John and Kenneth .",
      "From 1935 onward , he explored the use of electronics for telephone exchanges and by 1939 , he was convinced that an all-electronic system was possible . A background in switching electronics would prove crucial for his computer designs .",
      "World War II .",
      "Flowers first contact with wartime codebreaking came in February 1941 when his director , W . Gordon Radley , was asked for help by Alan Turing , who was working at Bletchley Park the government codebreaking establishment , north west of London in Buckinghamshire . Turing wanted Flowers to build a decoder for the relay-based Bombe machine , which Turing had developed to help decrypt German Enigma codes . The decoder project was abandoned but Turing was impressed with Flowerss work , and in February 1943 introduced him to Max Newman who was leading the effort to automate part of the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher . This was a high-level German code generated by a teletypewriter in-line cipher machine , the Lorenz SZ40/42 , one of their ( secret writer ) systems , called Tunny ( tuna fish ) by the British . It was a much more complex system than Enigma ; the decoding procedure involved trying so many possibilities that it was impractical to do by hand . Flowers and Frank Morrell ( also at Dollis Hill ) designed the Heath Robinson , in an attempt to automate the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz SZ-40/42 cipher machine .",
      "Flowers proposed a more sophisticated alternative , using an electronic system , which his staff called Colossus , using perhaps 1,800 thermionic valves ( vacuum tubes ) instead of 150 and having only one paper tape instead of two ( which required synchronisation ) by generating the wheel patterns electronically . Because the most complicated previous electronic device had used about 150 valves , some were sceptical that the system would be reliable . Flowers countered that the British telephone system used thousands of valves and was reliable because the electronics were operated in a stable environment with the circuitry on all the time . The Bletchley management were not convinced and merely encouraged Flowers to proceed on his own . He did so at the Post Office Research Labs , using some of his own funds to build it .",
      "Despite the success of Colossus , the Heath Robinson approach was still valuable for solving certain problems . The final development of the concept was a machine called Super Robinson that was designed by Tommy Flowers . This one could run four tapes and was used for running depths and cribs or known-plaintext attack runs .",
      "Flowers gained full backing for his project from the director of the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill , W . G . Radley . With the highest priority for acquisition of parts , Flowerss team at Dollis Hill built the first machine in eleven months . It was immediately dubbed Colossus by the Bletchley Park staff for its immense proportions . The Mark 1 Colossus operated five times faster and was more flexible than the previous system , named Heath Robinson , which used electro-mechanical switches . The first Mark 1 , with 1500 valves , ran at Dollis Hill in November 1943 ; it was delivered to Bletchley Park in January 1944 where it was assembled and began operation in early February . The algorithms used by Colossus were developed by W . T . Tutte and his team of mathematicians . Colossus proved to be efficient and quick against the twelve-rotor Lorenz cipher SZ42 machine .",
      "In anticipation of a need for additional computers , Flowers was already working on Colossus Mark 2 which would employ 2,400 valves . The first Mark 2 went into service at Bletchley Park on 1 June 1944 and immediately produced vital information for the imminent D-Day landings planned for Monday 5 June ( postponed 24 hours by bad weather ) . Flowers later described a crucial meeting between Dwight D . Eisenhower and his staff on 5 June , during which a courier entered and handed Eisenhower a note summarising a Colossus decrypt . This confirmed that Adolf Hitler wanted no additional troops moved to Normandy , as he was still convinced that the preparations for the Normandy landings were a feint . Handing back the decrypt , Eisenhower announced to his staff , We go tomorrow . Earlier , a report from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel on the western defences was decoded by Colossus and revealed that one of the sites chosen as the drop site for a US parachute division was the base for a German tank division , so the site was changed .",
      "Years later , Flowers described the design and construction of the computers . Ten Colossi were completed and used during the Second World War in British decoding efforts and an eleventh was ready for commissioning at the end of the war . All but two were dismantled at the end of the war , The remaining two were moved to a British Intelligence department , GCHQ in Cheltenham , Gloucestershire , where they may have played a significant part in the codebreaking operations of the Cold War . They were finally decommissioned in 1959 and 1960 . A functioning Colossus Mark II was rebuilt by a team of volunteers led by Tony Sale between 1993 and 2008 . It is on display at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park .",
      "Post-war work and retirement .",
      "After the war , Flowers received little recognition for his contribution to cryptanalysis . The government granted him \u00a31,000 payment which did not cover Flowers personal investment in the equipment ; he shared much of the money amongst the staff who had helped him build and test Colossus . Flowers applied for a loan from the Bank of England to build another machine like Colossus but was denied the loan because the bank did not believe that such a machine could work . He could not argue that he had already designed and built many of these machines because his work on Colossus was covered by the Official Secrets Act . It was not until the 1970s that Flowers work in computing was fully acknowledged . His family had known only that he had done some secret and important work . He remained at the Post Office Research Station where he was Head of the Switching Division . He and his group pioneered work on all-electronic telephone exchanges , completing a basic design by about 1950 , which led on to the Highgate Wood Telephone Exchange . He was also involved in the development of ERNIE . In 1964 , he became head of the advanced development at Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd. , where he continued to develop electronic telephone switching including a pulse amplitude modulation exchange , retiring in 1969 .",
      "In 1976 , he published Introduction to Exchange Systems , a book on the engineering principles of telephone exchanges .",
      "In 1977 , Flowers was made an honorary Doctor of Science by Newcastle University .",
      "In 1980 , he was the first winner of the Martlesham Medal in recognition of his achievements in computing .",
      "In 1993 , he received a certificate from , having completed a basic course in information processing on a personal computer .",
      "Flowers died in 1998 aged 92 , leaving a wife and two sons . He is commemorated at the Post Office Research Station site , which became a housing development , with the main building converted into a block of flats and an access road called Flowers Close . He was honoured by London Borough of Tower Hamlets , where he was born . An Information and Communications Technology ( ICT ) centre for young people , the Tommy Flowers Centre , opened there in November 2010 . The centre has closed but the building is now the Tommy Flowers Centre , part of the Tower Hamlets Pupil Referral Unit .",
      "In September 2012 , his wartime diary was put on display at Bletchley Park . A road in Kesgrave , near the current BT Research Laboratories , is named Tommy Flowers Drive .",
      "On 12 December 2013 , 70 years after he created Colossus , his legacy was honoured with a memorial commissioned by BT , successor to Post Office Telephones . The life-size bronze bust , designed by James Butler , was unveiled by Trevor Baylis at Adastral Park , BTs research and development centre in Martlesham Heath , near Ipswich , Suffolk . BT also began a computer science scholarship and award in his name .",
      "On 29 September 2016 , BT opened the Tommy Flowers Institute for ICT training at Adastral Park to support the development of postgraduates transferring into industry . The institute focuses on bringing ICT-sector organisations together with academic researchers to solve some of the challenges facing UK businesses , exploring areas such as cybersecurity , big data , autonomics and converged networks . The launch event was attended by professors from Cambridge , Oxford , East Anglia , Essex , Imperial , UCL , Southampton , Surrey , and Lancaster as well as representatives from the National Physical Laboratory , Huawei , Ericsson , CISCO , ARM and ADVA .",
      "In 2018 , a room in the newly refurbished Institution of Engineering and Technology in London was named the Flowers Room ."

      "LMS Fowler Class 3F",
      "The London Midland and Scottish Railway ( LMS ) Fowler 3F is a class of steam locomotive , often known as Jinty . They represent the ultimate development of the Midland Railways six-coupled tank engines . They could reach speeds of up to 60 mph ( 97 km/h ) .",
      "Introduction .",
      "Design of this class was based on rebuilds by Henry Fowler of the Midland Railway 2441 Class introduced in 1899 by Samuel Waite Johnson . These rebuilds featured a Belpaire firebox and improved cab . 422 Jinties were built between 1924 and 1931 ; this class was just one of the Midland designs used on an ongoing basis by the LMS . The locomotives were built by the ex-L&YR Horwich Works and the private firms Bagnalls , Beardmores , Hunslet , North British and the Vulcan Foundry .",
      "Details .",
      "When new , they were numbered 7100\u20137149 , 16400\u201316764 . Numbers 7150\u20137156 were added when the LMS absorbed the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway locomotives in 1930 . In the 1934 LMS renumbering scheme , the locomotives were assigned the series 7260\u20137681 . On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 they were initially chosen as the standard shunting locomotive for the War Department , but later the more modern Hunslet Austerity was chosen in preference . Nevertheless , eight were dispatched to France before its fall in 1940 , and only five returned in 1948 . Two , 7456 and 7553 , were converted to the Irish broad gauge in 1944 and 1945 for use on Northern Counties Committee lines in Northern Ireland , becoming the NCC Class Y , and numbered 18 and 19 . A total of 412 thus entered British Railways stock in 1948 , rising to 417 by the end of the year .",
      "British Railways numbers were the LMS numbers prefixed with 4 . Numbers 47477 , 47478 , 47479 , 47480 , 47481 , 47655 and 47681 were fitted for push-pull train working .",
      "Withdrawal .",
      "The first withdrawals started in 1959 and by 1964 half had been withdrawn . The final five survived until 1967 , with a further one , 47445 continuing with the National Coal Board .",
      "Preservation .",
      "Thanks to their large numbers , renowned performance and late withdrawals , nine of these engines have been preserved , along with a spare set of frames and a boiler ( from 47564 ) . Many were restored within a few years of leaving the scrap heap , and most have a further working life ahead of them . All have steamed in preservation , with the exception of 47445 .",
      "One member of the class has operated on the main line in preservation . This was 7298/47298 , which took part during the Rainhill celebrations in 1980 when it hauled a number of Steamport residents from the museum in Southport to Rainhill and also took part in the cavalcade . Owned by Ian Riley , in February 2017 it was undergoing its ten-yearly overhaul and was expected to return to operation in a couple of years .",
      "Locations and condition are shown below ( current numbers in bold ) :",
      "In fiction .",
      "An engine of this type can be seen in the Rev . W . Awdrys The Railway Series book The Eight Famous Engines . The characters name was Jinty , and came from the Other Railway ( aka British Railways ) to help out when the main engines went on a journey to England .",
      "In the videogame Transport Tycoon of Chris Sawyer , the Jinty is offered as the cheapest and most basic engine of the game .",
      "Models .",
      "An OO gauge model of the Class 3F was first produced by Tri-ang in 1952 and production continued after the company became Hornby Railways in the 1970s . Hornby released a retooled version in 1978 with better detailing and continue to produce that model for their Railroad range .",
      "In the 2000s Bachmann Branchline released a more detailed OO model . In N gauge Graham Farish produced a model as a GP Tank in various liveries including some of other railway companies before later tooling an accurate Jinty model . In O gauge and Gauge 1 Bachmann Brassworks produce an example . In O gauge , Connoisseur Models produces an etched brass kit . In HO ( 3.5 mm ) scale Firedrake Productions produced a small run of 20 kits .",
      "Darstaed , a model train company in Great Britain , produced O gauge tintype models of the LMS Fowler Class 3F , affectionately referring to them by the nickname of Jinty",
      "Dapol has produced a Jinty for the O gauge market which was released in September 2017",

      "McCormick Apartments , also known as Andrew Mellon Building , Mellon Apartment , or 1785 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest , is a landmark apartment building on Embassy Row in Washington , D.C. , whose inhabitants once included Andrew W . Mellon . It is the home of the American Enterprise Institute .",
      "History .",
      "The Andrew Mellon Building was built by Stanley McCormick , heir to the International Harvester fortune , in 1915 and completed in 1917 . Washington-based Jules Henri de Sibour was architect of the building . This was one of the first Washington apartment buildings for luxury living . The structure was meant to fit in with other Beaux-Arts buildings in the Dupont Circle neighborhood . The buildings composition is three principal elevations , to serve as a pivot point for a residential boulevard and two street intersections . The six units it originally contained had quarters for more than forty servants . Some of the Capitals most distinguished personalities once lived here . A partial listing of these residents , from the Historic American Buildings Survey , includes :",
      "- Thomas F . Ryan , 1920\u20131922",
      "- Robert Woods Bliss , 1920\u20131923",
      "- Edwin T . Meredith , 1921",
      "- Andrew W . Mellon , 1922\u20131937",
      "- Sumner Welles , 1921\u20131927",
      "- Alanson B . Houghton , 1930\u20131934",
      "The millionaire industrialist Andrew Mellon is perhaps most significant of these past occupants . He was Secretary of the Treasury from 1921 to 1932 . This was the longest tenure since Albert Gallatin . Mellon made this his residence shortly after taking on that role , occupying the top floor from 1922 until his death in 1937 . Among his accomplishments include authoring the Mellon Plan which stimulated the economic boom of the 1920s , and founding the National Gallery of Art . In 1936 Mellon paid $21 million for paintings and sculptures owned by Sir Joseph Duveen , an art dealer leasing the apartment below . At the time this was the largest art transaction on record .",
      "After 1941 , the building was used for offices and eventually partitioned . The property was conveyed by deed from Katherine Dexter McCormick to the American Council on Education on March 31 , 1950 . Later the property was conveyed to The Brookings Institution on January 2 , 1970 . Finally , the building was sold to the National Trust for Historic Preservation on October 28 , 1976 .",
      "The Andrew Mellon Building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976 .",
      "2013 sale .",
      "The National Trust put the building up for sale in mid-2009 . The organization said it had outgrown the building , and needed about of space . Real estate experts believed the structure would sell for $1,000 a square foot , or $60 million . Potential buyers considered turning it into a museum or luxury apartments again , but there were no offers at any price . After Trust president Richard Moe stepped down in early 2010 and was replaced by Stephanie Meeks , the organizations board of directors decided to pull the building off the market so that Meeks would not have to devote all her time to finding the National Trust a new home . Instead , National Trust officials said they would rehabilitate some of the structures windows , HVAC , and mechanical systems and possibly add a green roof .",
      "In late June 2013 , the National Trust sold the Mellon Building to the American Enterprise Institute for $36.5 million . The Trust said it will lease space on the top two floors of the Watergate Office Building . The National Trust holds a permanent historic preservation easement that protects both the interior and exterior of the Mellon Building .",

      "Pavel Stepanovich Nakhimov ( , ) ( \u2013 ) , one of the most famous admirals in Russian naval history , is best remembered as the commander of naval and land forces during the Siege of Sevastopol ( 1854-1855 ) during the Crimean War .",
      "Biography .",
      "Born in the village of ( district ) of Smolensk Governorate into a noble Russian family . He was the seventh of eleven children of a landlord , a second major Stepan Mikhailovich Nakhimov and his wife Feodosia Ivanovna Nakhimova ( n\u00e9e Kozlovskaya ) . Six of his siblings died as infants ; all of his four brothers also became professional seamen , including vice admiral ( 1805\u20141872 ) .",
      "In 1817 he entered the Naval Academy for the Nobility ( Morskoy Dvoryanskiy Korpus ) in Saint Petersburg . He made his first sea voyage in 1817 , aboard the frigate Feniks ( Phoenix ) , to the shores of Sweden and Denmark . Soon afterwards he was promoted to the rank of non-commissioned officer . In February 1818 he passed examinations to become a midshipman and was immediately assigned to the second Fleet Crew ( Flotskiy Ekipazh ) of the Russian Imperial Navys Baltic Fleet .",
      "At the beginning of his naval career , Nakhimovs experience was limited to voyages in the Baltic Sea and to a more extensive trip from the White Sea port of Arkhangelsk to Kronstadt naval base near Saint Petersburg . His lucky break came in March 1822 , when he was assigned to the frigate Kreiser ( Cruiser ) ; the vessel took part in a round-the-globe expedition commanded by the well-known Russian explorer Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev ( 1788-1851 ) , who had already undertaken several such voyages .",
      "During the three-year voyage , Nakhimov was promoted to the rank of lieutenant . On conclusion of this adventure , he received his first award , the Order of Saint Vladimir IV degree . He returned to his native Smolensk and was assigned to the 74-gun warship Azov , which made its maiden voyage from Arkhangelsk to Kronstadt in the autumn of 1826 .",
      "In the summer of 1827 , Azov sailed to the Mediterranean as flagship of the Russian squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral Lodewijk van Heiden for a joint expedition with the French and British navies against the Ottomans . Just before its departure , Emperor Nicholas I visited the Azov and ordered that in the case of hostilities , the crew should deal with the enemy as the Russians do .",
      "Azov , under then-Captain First Rank M.P . Lazarev , distinguished itself most prominently in the Battle of Navarino ( 20 October 1827 ) , during which the allied British-French-Russian fleet totally destroyed the Ottoman squadron .",
      "For his outstanding gunnery performance during the battle , the 27-year-old Nakhimov was promoted to the captaincy of a trophy ship and was decorated by the allied governments .",
      "During the Crimean War of 1853-1856 Nakhimov distinguished himself by annihilating the Ottoman fleet at Sinope in 1853 . His finest hour came during the siege of Sevastopol , where he and Admiral V . A . Kornilov organized from scratch the land defense of the city and its port , the home base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet . As the commander of the port and the military governor of the city , Nakhimov became in fact the head of the Sevastopol naval and land defense forces . On , while inspecting the forward-defense positions on Malakhov Kurgan , he was fatally wounded by a sniper ; he died two days later .",
      "Nakhimov was buried inside St Vladimirs Cathedral in Sevastopol along with Mikhail Lazarev , V.A . Kornilov and Vladimir Istomin . There is a monument erected in his memory . The Soviet government instituted posthumous honors as well , introducing Nakhimov Naval Schools for teenagers in 1943 , and establishing in 1944 both the Order of Nakhimov ( with two degrees ) and the Nakhimov Medal for Navy personnel . The Order of Nakhimov , one of the highest military decorations in the Soviet Union , continues in the Russian Federation .",

      "Milton Friedman",
      "Milton Friedman ( ; July 31 , 1912 \u2013 November 16 , 2006 ) was an American economist and statistician who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis , monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy . With George Stigler and others , Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the Chicago school of economics , a neoclassical school of economic thought associated with the work of the faculty at the University of Chicago that rejected Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the mid-1970s , when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations . Several students , young professors and academics who were recruited or mentored by Friedman at Chicago went on to become leading economists , including Gary Becker , Robert Fogel , Thomas Sowell and Robert Lucas Jr .",
      "Friedmans challenges to what he later called naive Keynesian theory began with his interpretation of consumption , which tracks how consumers spend . He introduced a theory which would later become part of the mainstream and among the first to propagate the theory of consumption smoothing . During the 1960s he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies , and described his approach ( along with mainstream economics ) as using Keynesian language and apparatus yet rejecting its initial conclusions . He theorized that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that unemployment below this rate would cause inflation to accelerate . He argued that the Phillips curve was in the long run vertical at the natural rate and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation . Friedman promoted a macroeconomic viewpoint known as Monetarism and argued that a steady , small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy , as compared to rapid , and unexpected changes . His ideas concerning monetary policy , taxation , privatization and deregulation influenced government policies , especially during the 1980s . His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserves monetary policy in response to the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 .",
      "After retiring from the University of Chicago in 1977 , and becoming Emeritus professor in economics in 1983 , Friedman was an advisor to Republican President Ronald Reagan and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal government intervention in social matters . He once stated that his role in eliminating conscription in the United States was his proudest achievement . In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom , Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military , freely floating exchange rates , abolition of medical licenses , a negative income tax and school vouchers and opposition to the war on drugs and support for drug liberalization policies . His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice , later renamed EdChoice .",
      "Friedmans works cover a broad range of economic topics and public policy issues . His books and essays have had global influence , including in former communist states . A 2011 survey of economists commissioned by the EJW ranked Friedman as the second-most popular economist of the 20th century , following only by John Maynard Keynes . Upon his death , The Economist described him as the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century .. . possibly of all of it .",
      "Early life .",
      "Friedman was born in Brooklyn , New York on July 31 , 1912 . His parents , S\u00e1ra Ethel ( n\u00e9e Landau ) and Jen\u0151 Saul Friedman , were Jewish working-class immigrants from Beregsz\u00e1sz in Carpathian Ruthenia , Kingdom of Hungary ( now Berehove in Ukraine ) . They emigrated to America in their early teens . They both worked as dry goods merchants . Friedman was their fourth child and only son . Shortly after his birth , the family relocated to Rahway , New Jersey .",
      "Friedmans family experienced financial troubles , and financial uncertainty caused stability of income to be low . Friedman described his familys situation in the following manner :",
      "Friedmans father , Jen\u0151 Saul Friedman , died during Friedmans senior year of high school , leaving Friedman and two older sisters to care for his mother , S\u00e1ra Ethel Friedman .",
      "In his early teens , Friedman was injured in a car accident , which scarred his upper lip . A talented student and an avid reader , Friedman graduated from Rahway High School in 1928 , just before his 16th birthday . Although no family members had gone to university before Milton , Friedman was awarded a competitive scholarship to Rutgers University ( then a private university receiving limited support from the State of New Jersey , e.g. , for such scholarships ) . Friedman was expected to finance the cost of university himself . He graduated from Rutgers in 1932 .",
      "Friedman initially intended to become an actuary or mathematician , however the state of the economy , which was at this point in a deep depression , convinced him to become an economist . He was offered two scholarships to do graduate work , one in mathematics at Brown University and the other in economics at the University of Chicago , where he would later teach . Friedman chose the latter , earning a Master of Arts degree in 1933 . He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner , Frank Knight , and Henry Simons . Friedman met his future wife , economist Rose Director , while at the University of Chicago .",
      "During the 1933\u20131934 academic year , he had a fellowship at Columbia University , where he studied statistics with statistician and economist Harold Hotelling . He was back in Chicago for the 1934\u20131935 academic year , working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz , who was then working on Theory and Measurement of Demand .",
      "During the aforementioned 1934-35 academic year , Friedman formed what would later prove to be lifetime friendships with George Stigler and W . Allen Wallis , both of whom teached with Friedman at the University of Chicago .",
      "Public service .",
      "Friedman was unable to find academic employment , so in 1935 he followed his friend W . Allen Wallis to Washington , D.C. , where Franklin D . Roosevelts New Deal was a lifesaver for many young economists . At this stage , Friedman said he and his wife regarded the job-creation programs such as the WPA , CCC , and PWA appropriate responses to the critical situation , but not the price- and wage-fixing measures of the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration . Foreshadowing his later ideas , he believed price controls interfered with an essential signaling mechanism to help resources be used where they were most valued . Indeed , Friedman later concluded that all government intervention associated with the New Deal was the wrong cure for the wrong disease , arguing the Federal Reserve was to blame , and that they should have expanded the money supply in reaction to what he later described in A Monetary History of the United States as The Great Contraction . Later , Friedman and his colleague Anna Schwartz wrote A Monetary History of the United States , 1867\u20131960 , which argued that the Great Depression was caused by a severe monetary contraction due to banking crises and poor policy on the part of the Federal Reserve . Robert J . Shiller describes the book as the most influential account of the Great Depression .",
      "During 1935 , he began working for the National Resources Planning Board , which was then working on a large consumer budget survey . Ideas from this project later became a part of his Theory of the Consumption Function , a book which first described consumption smoothing and the Permanent Income Hypothesis . Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during the autumn of 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income . This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice , which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income , a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s . The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices .",
      "Incomes from Independent Professional Practice remained quite controversial within the economics community because of Friedmans hypothesis that barriers to entry , which were exercised and enforced by the American Medical Association , led to higher than average wages for physicians , compared to other professional groups . Barriers to entry are a fixed cost which must be incurred regardless of any outside factors such as work experience , or other factors of human capital .",
      "During 1940 , Friedman was appointed as an assistant professor teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison , but encountered anti semitism in the Economics department and returned to government service . From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government , as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury . As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 , he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation . He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system , since the federal government needed money to fund the war . He later said , I have no apologies for it , but I really wish we hadnt found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now . In Milton and Rose Friedmans jointly-written memoir , he wrote , Rose has repeatedly chided me over the years about the role that I played in making possible the current overgrown government we both criticize so strongly .",
      "Academic career .",
      "Early years .",
      "In 1940 , Friedman accepted a position at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison , but left because of differences with faculty regarding United States involvement in World War II . Friedman believed the United States should enter the war . In 1943 , Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University ( headed by W . Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling ) , where he spent the rest of World War II working as a mathematical statistician , focusing on problems of weapons design , military tactics , and metallurgical experiments .",
      "In 1945 , Friedman submitted Incomes from Independent Professional Practice ( co-authored with Kuznets and completed during 1940 ) to Columbia as his doctoral dissertation . The university awarded him a PhD in 1946 . Friedman spent the 1945\u20131946 academic year teaching at the University of Minnesota ( where his friend George Stigler was employed ) . On February 12 , 1945 , his only son , David D . Friedman , who would later follow in his fathers footsteps and an economist was born .",
      "University of Chicago .",
      "In 1946 , Friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the University of Chicago ( a position opened by departure of his former professor Jacob Viner to Princeton University ) . Friedman would work for the University of Chicago for the next 30 years . There he contributed to the establishment of an intellectual community that produced a number of Nobel Memorial Prize winners , known collectively as the Chicago school of economics .",
      "At the time , Arthur F . Burns , who was then the head of the National Bureau of Economic Research , and later chairman of the Federal Reserve , asked Friedman to rejoin the Bureaus staff . He accepted the invitation , and assumed responsibility for the Bureaus inquiry into the role of money in the business cycle . As a result , he initiated the Workshop in Money and Banking ( the Chicago Workshop ) , which promoted a revival of monetary studies . During the latter half of the 1940s , Friedman began a collaboration with Anna Schwartz , an economic historian at the Bureau , that would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book co-authored by Friedman and Schwartz , A Monetary History of the United States , 1867\u20131960 .",
      "Friedman spent the 1954\u20131955 academic year as a Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College , Cambridge . At the time , the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority ( including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn ) and an anti-Keynesian minority ( headed by Dennis Robertson ) . Friedman speculated he was invited to the fellowship because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions . Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine ( 1966\u201384 ) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people , and helped earn the magazine a Gerald Loeb Special Award in 1968 . From 1968 to 1978 , he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series , a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days issues for about a half-hour at a time .",
      "A Theory of the Consumption Function .",
      "One of Milton Friedmans most popular works , A Theory of the Consumption Function , challenged traditional Keynesian viewpoints about the household . This work was originally published in 1957 by Princeton University Press , and it reanalyzed the relationship displayed between aggregate consumption or aggregate savings and aggregate income .",
      "Friedmans counterpart Keynes believed people would modify their household consumption expenditures to relate to their existing income levels . Friedmans research introduced the term permanent income to the world , which was the average of a households expected income over several years , and he also developed the permanent income hypothesis . Friedman thought income consisted of several components , namely transitory and permanent . He established the formula formula_1 in order to calculate income , with p representing the permanent component , and t representing the transitory component.Milton Friedmans research changed how economists interpreted the consumption function , and his work pushed the idea that current income was not the only factor affecting peoples adjustment household consumption expenditures . Instead , expected income levels also affected how households would change their consumption expenditures . Friedmans contributions strongly influenced research on consumer behavior , and he further defined how to predict consumption smoothing , which contradicts Keynes marginal propensity to consume . Although this work presented many controversial points of view which differed from existing viewpoints established by Keynes , A Theory of the Consumption Function helped Friedman gain respect in the field of economics . His work on the Permanent Income Hypothesis is among the many contributions which were listed as reasons for his Sveriges-Riskbank Prize in Economic Sciences . His work was later expanded on by Christopher D . Carroll , especially in regards to the absence of liquidity constraints .",
      "The Permanent Income Hypothesis faces some criticism , mainly from Keynesian economists . The primary criticism of the hypothesis is based off a lack of liquidity constraints .",
      "Capitalism and Freedom .",
      "His book Capitalism and Freedom , inspired by a series of lectures he gave at Wabash College , brought him national and international attention outside academia . It was published in 1962 by the University of Chicago Press and consists of essays that used non-mathematical economic models to explore issues of public policy . It sold over 400,000 copies in the first eighteen years and more than half a million since 1962 . Capitalism and Freedom was translated into eighteen languages . Friedman talks about the need to move to a classically liberal society , that free markets would help nations and individuals in the long-run and fix the efficiency problems currently faced by the United States and other major countries of the 1950s and 1960s . He goes through the chapters specifying an issue in each respective chapter from the role of government and money supply to social welfare programs to a special chapter on occupational licensure . Friedman concludes Capitalism and Freedom with his classical liberal [ sic ] stance that government should stay out of matters that do not need and should only involve itself when absolutely necessary for the survival of its people and the country . He recounts how the best of a countrys abilities come from its free markets while its failures come from government intervention .",
      "Post-retirement .",
      "In 1977 , at the age of 65 , Friedman retired from the University of Chicago after teaching there for 30 years . He and his wife moved to San Francisco , where he became a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco . From 1977 on , he was affiliated with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University .",
      "During 1977 , Friedman was approached by Bob Chitester and the Free to Choose Network . They asked him to create a television program presenting his economic and social philosophy .",
      "Friedman and his wife Rose worked on this project for the next three years , and during 1980 , the ten-part series , titled Free to Choose , was broadcast by the Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) . The companion book to the series ( co-authored by Milton and his wife , Rose Friedman ) , also titled Free To Choose , was the bestselling nonfiction book of 1980 .",
      "Friedman served as an unofficial adviser to Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign , and then served on the Presidents Economic Policy Advisory Board for the rest of the Reagan Administration . Ebenstein says Friedman was the guru of the Reagan administration . In 1988 he received the National Medal of Science and Reagan honored him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom .",
      "Friedman is known now as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century . Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , Friedman continued to write editorials and appear on television . He made several visits to Eastern Europe and to China , where he also advised governments . He was also for many years a Trustee of the Philadelphia Society .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Friedman had two children , David and Jan . He first met his wife , Rose Friedman ( n\u00e9e Director ) , at the University of Chicago in 1932 , and later wed six years later , in 1938 .",
      "Friedman was noticeably shorter than some of his colleagues ; he measured , and has been described as an Elfin Libertarian by Binyamin Appelbaum .",
      "Rose Friedman , when asked about Friedmans successes , said that \u201cI have never had the desire to compete with Milton professionally ( perhaps because I was smart enough to recognize I couldnt ) . On the other hand , he has always made me feel that his achievement is my achievement .",
      "During the 1960s , Friedman built , and subsequently maintained a cottage in Fairlee , Vermont . Friedman also had an apartment in Russian Hill , San Francisco , where he lived from 1977 until his death .",
      "Religious views .",
      "According to a 2007 article in Commentary magazine , his parents were moderately observant Jews , but Friedman , after an intense burst of childhood piety , rejected religion altogether . He described himself as an agnostic . Friedman wrote extensively of his life and experiences , especially in 1998 in his memoirs with his wife , Rose , titled Two Lucky People . In this book , Rose Friedman describes how she and Milton Friedman raised their two children , Janet and David , with a Christmas Tree in the home . Orthodox Jews of course , do not celebrate Christmas . However , just as , when I was a child , my mother had permitted me to have a Christmas tree one year when my friend had one , she not only tolerated our having a Christmas tree , she even strung popcorn to hang on it .",
      "Death .",
      "Friedman died of heart failure at the age of 94 years in San Francisco on November 16 , 2006 . He was still a working economist performing original economic research ; his last column was published in The Wall Street Journal the day after his death . He was survived by his wife , Rose Friedman ( who would die on August 18 , 2009 ) and their two children , David D . Friedman , known for The Machinery of Freedom , as well as his unique anarcho-capitalism from a Chicago School perspective , and attorney and bridge player Jan Martel .",
      "Scholarly contributions .",
      "Economics .",
      "Friedman was best known for reviving interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output , that is , the quantity theory of money . Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory . Its origins can be traced back to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further ; however , Friedmans contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization . He co-authored , with Anna Schwartz , A Monetary History of the United States , 1867\u20131960 ( 1963 ) , which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S . history .",
      "Friedman was the main proponent of the monetarist school of economics . He maintained that there is a close and stable association between inflation and the money supply , mainly that inflation could be avoided with proper regulation of the monetary bases growth rate . He famously used the analogy of dropping money out of a helicopter , in order to avoid dealing with money injection mechanisms and other factors that would overcomplicate his models .",
      "Friedmans arguments were designed to counter the popular concept of cost-push inflation , that the increased general price level at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil , or increases in wages ; as he wrote :",
      "Friedman rejected the use of fiscal policy as a tool of demand management ; and he held that the governments role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely . Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression , and he termed the 1929\u20131933 period the Great Contraction . He argued that the Depression had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve .",
      "This theory was put forth in A Monetary History of the United States , and the chapter on the Great Depression was then published as a stand-alone book entitled The Great Contraction , 1929\u20131933 . Both books are still in print from the Princeton University Press , and some editions include as an appendix a speech at a University of Chicago event honoring Friedman in which Ben Bernanke made this statement :",
      "Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve . I would like to say to Milton and Anna : Regarding the Great Depression , youre right . We did it . Were very sorry . But thanks to you , we wont do it again .",
      "Friedman also argued for the removal of government intervention in currency markets , thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject , as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates . His close friend George Stigler explained , As is customary in science , he did not win a full victory , in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations , a newer approach developed by Robert Lucas , also at the University of Chicago . The relationship between Friedman and Lucas , or new classical macroeconomics as a whole , was highly complex . The Friedmanian Phillips curve was an interesting starting point for Lucas , but he soon realized that the solution provided by Friedman was not quite satisfactory . Lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the Friedmanian adaptive expectations . Due to this reformulation , the story in which the theory of the new classical Phillips curve was embedded radically changed . This modification , however , had a significant effect on Friedmans own approach , so , as a result , the theory of the Friedmanian Phillips curve also changed . Moreover , new classical adherent Neil Wallace , who was a graduate student at the University of Chicago between 1960 and 1963 , regarded Friedmans theoretical courses as a mess , highlighting the strained relationship between Monetarism and new classical schools .",
      "Friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function , the permanent income hypothesis ( 1957 ) , which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work . This work contended that utility-maximizing consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income . Permanent Income refers to such factors like human capital . Windfall gains would mostly be saved because of the law of diminishing marginal utility .",
      "Friedmans essay The Methodology of Positive Economics ( 1953 ) provided the epistemological pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the Chicago School . There he argued that economics as science should be free of value judgments for it to be objective . Moreover , a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction . That is , students should measure the accuracy of its predictions , rather than the soundness of its assumptions . His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as Jerzy Neyman , Leonard Savage , and Ronald Fisher .",
      "However , despite being an advocate of the free market , Milton Friedman believed that the government had two crucial roles . In an interview with Phil Donahue , Milton Friedman argued that the two basic functions of a government are to protect the nation against foreign enemy , and to protect citizens against its fellows.\u201d He also admitted that although privatization of national defense could reduce the overall cost , he has not yet thought of a way to make this privatization possible .",
      "Rejection and subsequent evolution of the Philips Curve .",
      "Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment ( 1968 ) . This critique associated his name , together with that of Edmund Phelps , with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so . Unemployment may be temporarily lower , if the inflation is a surprise , but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market . If the conditions are not met and inflation is expected , the long run effects will replace the short term effects .",
      "Through his critique , the Philips curve evolved from a strict model emphasizing the connection between inflation and unemployment as being absolute , to a model which emphasized short term unemployment reductions and long term employment stagnations .",
      "Friedmans revised and updated Phillips Curve also changed as a result of Robert Lucass idea of Rational Expectations , replacing the adaptive expectations Friedman used .",
      "Statistics .",
      "One of his most famous contributions to statistics is sequential sampling . Friedman did statistical work at the Division of War Research at Columbia , where he and his colleagues came up with the technique . It became , in the words of The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics , the standard analysis of quality control inspection . The dictionary adds , Like many of Friedmans contributions , in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control ; that , however , is a measure of his genius .",
      "Public policy positions .",
      "Federal Reserve and monetary policy .",
      "Although Friedman concluded the government does have a role in the monetary system he was critical of the Federal Reserve due to its poor performance and felt it should be abolished . He was opposed to Federal Reserve policies , even during the so-called Volcker shock that was labeled monetarist . Friedman believed the Federal Reserve System should ultimately be replaced with a computer program . He favored a system that would automatically buy and sell securities in response to changes in the money supply .",
      "The proposal to constantly grow the money supply at a certain predetermined amount every year has become known as Friedmans k-percent rule . There is debate about the effectiveness of a theoretical money supply targeting regime . The Feds inability to meet its money supply targets from 1978\u20131982 led some to conclude it is not a feasible alternative to more conventional inflation and interest rate targeting . Towards the end of his life , Friedman expressed doubt about the validity of targeting the quantity of money . To date , most countries have adopted inflation targeting instead of the k-percent rule .",
      "Idealistically , Friedman actually favored the principles of the 1930s Chicago plan , which would have ended fractional reserve banking and , thus , private money creation . It would force banks to have 100% reserves backing deposits , and instead place money creation powers solely in the hands of the US Government . This would make targeting money growth more possible , as endogenous money created by fractional reserve lending would no longer be a major issue .",
      "Friedman was a strong advocate for floating exchange rates throughout the entire Bretton-Woods period ( 1944-1971 ) . He argued that a flexible exchange rate would make external adjustment possible and allow countries to avoid balance of payments crises . He saw fixed exchange rates as an undesirable form of government intervention . The case was articulated in an influential 1953 paper , The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates , at a time when most commentators regarded the possibility of floating exchange rates as an unrealistic policy proposal .",
      "Foreign Policy .",
      "In his 1955 article The Role of Government in Education Friedman proposed supplementing publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of school vouchers . Reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in , for example , Chile in 1981 and Sweden in 1992 . In 1996 , Friedman , together with his wife , founded the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice to advocate school choice and vouchers . In 2016 , the Friedman Foundation changed its name to EdChoice to honor the Friedmans desire to have the educational choice movement live on without their names attached to it after their deaths .",
      "While Walter Oi is credited with establishing the economic basis for a volunteer military , Friedman was a proponent , and was credited with ending the draft , stating that the draft was inconsistent with a free society .",
      "In Capitalism and Freedom , he argued conscription is inequitable and arbitrary , preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit . During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force . He would later state his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment . Friedman did , however , believe the introduction of a system of universal military training as a reserve in cases of war-time could be justified .",
      "He still opposed its implementation in the United States , describing it as a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d .",
      "Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift over time in Friedmans views from an interventionist to a more cautious foreign policy . He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard-line against Communism , but moderated over time . However , Friedman did state in a 1995 interview that he was an anti-interventionist . He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War . In a spring 2006 interview , Friedman said the USs stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War , but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country .",
      "Libertarianism and the Republican Party .",
      "Friedman was an economic advisor and speech writer in Barry Goldwaters failed presidential campaign in 1964 . He was an advisor to California governor Ronald Reagan , and was active in Reagans presidential campaigns . He served as a member of President Reagans Economic Policy Advisory Board starting in 1981 . In 1988 , he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science .",
      "Friedman stated that he was a libertarian philosophically , but a member of the U.S . Republican Party for the sake of expediency ( I am a libertarian with a small l and a Republican with a capital R . And I am a Republican with a capital R on grounds of expediency , not on principle. ) But , he said , I think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable . I dont really care very much what Im called . Im much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas , rather than the person .",
      "His citation for the Presidential Medal of Freedom reads : He has used a brilliant mind to advance a moral vision : the vision of a society where men and women are free , free to choose , but where government is not as free to override their decisions . That vision has changed America , and it is changing the world . All of us owe a tremendous debt to this man\u2019s towering intellect and his devotion to liberty .",
      "Governmental Involvement in the Economy .",
      "Friedman was supportive of the state provision of some public goods that private businesses are not considered as being able to provide . However , he argued that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector . Above all , if some public goods are provided by the state , he believed that they should not be a legal monopoly where private competition is prohibited ; for example , he wrote :",
      "In 1962 , Friedman criticized Social Security in his book Capitalism and Freedom , arguing that it had created welfare dependency . However , in the penultimate chapter of the same book , Friedman argued that while capitalism had greatly reduced the extent of poverty in absolute terms , poverty is in part a relative matter , [ and ] even in [ wealthy Western ] countries , there are clearly many people living under conditions that the rest of us label as poverty . Friedman also noted that while private charity could be one recourse for alleviating poverty and cited late 19th century Britain and the United States as exemplary periods of extensive private charity and eleemosynary activity , he made the following point :",
      "Friedman argued further that other advantages of the negative income tax were that it could fit directly into the tax system , would be less costly , and would reduce the administrative burden of implementing a social safety net . Friedman reiterated these arguments 18 years later in Free to Choose , with the additional proviso that such a reform would only be satisfactory if it replaced the current system of welfare programs rather than augment it . According to economist Robert H . Frank , writing in The New York Times , Friedmans views in this regard were grounded in a belief that while market forces .. . accomplish wonderful things , they cannot ensure a distribution of income that enables all citizens to meet basic economic needs .",
      "Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute and Friedman hosted a series of conferences from 1986 to 1994 . The goal was to create a clear definition of economic freedom and a method for measuring it . Eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom , Economic Freedom in the World . This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations .",
      "With sixteen other distinguished economists he opposed the Copyright Term Extension Act , and signed on to an amicus brief filed in Eldred v . Ashcroft . Friedman jokingly described it as a no-brainer .",
      "Friedman argued for stronger basic legal ( constitutional ) protection of economic rights and freedoms to further promote industrial-commercial growth and prosperity and buttress democracy and freedom and the rule of law generally in society .",
      "Social Issues .",
      "Friedman also supported libertarian policies such as legalization of drugs and prostitution . During 2005 , Friedman and more than 500 other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the legalization of marijuana .",
      "Friedman was also a supporter of gay rights . He never specifically supported same-sex marriage , instead saying I do not believe there should be any discrimination against gays .",
      "Friedman favored immigration , saying legal and illegal immigration has a very positive impact on the U.S . economy . However , he suggested that immigrants ought not to have access to the welfare system . Friedman stated that immigration from Mexico had been a good thing , in particular illegal immigration . Friedman argued that illegal immigration was a boon because they take jobs that most residents of this country are unwilling to take , they provide employers with workers of a kind they cannot get and they do not use welfare . In Free to Choose , Friedman wrote :",
      "No arbitrary obstacles should prevent people from achieving those positions for which their talents fit them and which their values lead them to seek . Not birth , nationality , color , religion , sex , nor any other irrelevant characteristic should determine the opportunities that are open to a person \u2014 only his abilities.Friedman also famously argued that the welfare state must end before immigration , or more specifically , before open borders , because immigrants might have an incentive to come directly because of welfare payments . Economist Bryan Caplan has disputed this assertion , arguing that welfare is generally distributed not among immigrants , but instead retirees , through Social Security .",
      "Honors , recognition and legacy .",
      "George H . Nash , a leading historian of American conservatism , says that by the end of the 1960s he was probably the most highly regarded and influential conservative scholar in the country , and one of the few with an international reputation . In 1971 , Friedman received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement . Friedman allowed the libertarian Cato Institute to use his name for its biannual ( occuring every two years ) Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty beginning in 2001 . A Friedman Prize was given to the late British economist Peter Bauer in 2002 , Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto in 2004 , Mart Laar , former Estonian Prime Minister in 2006 and a young Venezuelan student Yon Goicoechea in 2008 . His wife Rose , sister of Aaron Director , with whom he initiated the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice , served on the international selection committee .",
      "Friedman was also a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics .",
      "Upon Friedmans death , Harvard President Lawrence Summers called him The Great Liberator , saying .. . any honest Democrat will admit that we are now all Friedmanites . He said Friedmans great popular contribution was in convincing people of the importance of allowing free markets to operate .",
      "Stephen Moore , a member of the editorial forward of The Wall Street Journal , said in 2013 : Quoting the most-revered champion of free-market economics since Adam Smith has become a little like quoting the Bible . He adds , There are sometimes multiple and conflicting interpretations .",
      "Although post-Keynesian economist John Kenneth Galbraith was a prominent critic of Friedman and his ideology , he conceded that \u201cThe age of John Maynard Keynes gave way to the age of Milton Friedman.\u201d",
      "1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences .",
      "Friedman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences , the sole recipient for 1976 , for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis , monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy . His appointment was controversial , mainly for his association with military dictator Augusto Pinochet . Some economists , such as Institutional economist and 1974 Nobel Prize winner Gunnar Myrdal , criticized Friedman , and Myrdals own 1974 Nobel Prize partner Friedrich Hayek , for being reactionaries . Myrdals criticism caused some economists to oppose the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economics Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel itself .",
      "Hong Kong .",
      "Friedman once said : If you want to see capitalism in action , go to Hong Kong . He wrote in 1990 that the Hong Kong economy was perhaps the best example of a free market economy .",
      "One month before his death , he wrote Hong Kong Wrong\u2014What would Cowperthwaite say ? in The Wall Street Journal , criticizing Donald Tsang , Chief Executive of Hong Kong , for abandoning positive non interventionism . Tsang later said he was merely changing the slogan to big market , small government , where small government is defined as less than 20% of GDP . In a debate between Tsang and his rival Alan Leong before the 2007 Hong Kong Chief Executive election , Leong introduced the topic and jokingly accused Tsang of angering Friedman to death ( Friedman had died only a year prior ) .",
      "Chile .",
      "During 1975 , two years after the military coup that brought military dictator President Augusto Pinochet to power and ended the government of Salvador Allende , the economy of Chile experienced a severe crisis . Friedman and Arnold Harberger accepted an invitation of a private Chilean foundation to visit Chile and speak on principles of economic freedom . He spent seven days in Chile giving a series of lectures at the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile and the ( National ) University of Chile . One of the lectures was entitled The Fragility of Freedom and according to Friedman , dealt with precisely the threat to freedom from a centralized military government .",
      "In a letter to Pinochet of April 21 , 1975 , Friedman considered the key economic problems of Chile are clearly .. . inflation and the promotion of a healthy social market economy . He stated that There is only one way to end inflation : by drastically reducing the rate of increase of the quantity of money .. . and that .. . cutting government spending is by far and away the most desirable way to reduce the fiscal deficit , because it .. . strengthens the private sector thereby laying the foundations for healthy economic growth . As to how rapidly inflation should be ended , Friedman felt that for Chile where inflation is raging at 10\u201320% a month .. . gradualism is not feasible . It would involve so painful an operation over so long a period that the patient would not survive . Choosing a brief period of higher unemployment .. . was the lesser evil. . and that the experience of Germany , .. . of Brazil ... , of the post-war adjustment in the U.S . .. . all argue for shock treatment . In the letter Friedman recommended to deliver the shock approach with .. . a package to eliminate the surprise and to relieve acute distress and .. . for definiteness let me sketch the contents of a package proposal .. . to be taken as illustrative although his knowledge of Chile was too limited to enable [ him ] to be precise or comprehensive . He listed a sample proposal of 8 monetary and fiscal measures including the removal of as many as obstacles as possible that now hinder the private market . For example , suspend .. . the present law against discharging employees . He closed , stating Such a shock program could end inflation in months . His letter suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes .",
      "Sergio de Castro , a Chilean Chicago School graduate , became the nations Minister of Finance in 1975 . During his six-year tenure , foreign investment increased , restrictions were placed on striking and labor unions , and GDP rose yearly . A foreign exchange program was created between the Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chicago . Many other Chicago School alumni were appointed government posts during and after Pinochets dictatorship ; others taught its economic doctrine at Chilean universities . They became known as the Chicago Boys .",
      "Friedman defended his activity in Chile on the grounds that , in his opinion , the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but also contributed to the amelioration of Pinochets rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990 . That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom , in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom . In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose , he said the following : Chile is not a politically free system , and I do not condone the system . But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role . .. . The conditions of the people in the past few years has been getting better and not worse . They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system . In 1984 , Friedman stated that he has never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile . In 1991 he said : I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed . It was a terrible political regime . The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically ; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market . .. . In Chile , the drive for political freedom , that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success , ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy . Now , at long last , Chile has all three things : political freedom , human freedom and economic freedom . Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether , now that it has political freedom , that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom . He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states . He further stated I do not consider it as evil for an economist to render technical economic advice to the Chilean Government , any more than I would regard it as evil for a physician to give technical medical advice to the Chilean Government to help end a medical plague .",
      "During the 2000 PBS documentary The Commanding Heights ( based on the book ) , Friedman continued to argue that free markets would undermine [ Pinochets ] political centralization and political control. , and that criticism over his role in Chile missed his main contention that freer markets resulted in freer people , and that Chiles unfree economy had caused Pinochets rise . Friedman advocated for free markets which undermined political centralization and political control .",
      "Iceland .",
      "Friedman visited Iceland during the autumn of 1984 , met with important Icelanders and gave a lecture at the University of Iceland on the tyranny of the status quo . He participated in a lively television debate on August 31 , 1984 , with socialist intellectuals , including \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson , who later became President of Iceland . When they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the university and that , hitherto , lectures by visiting scholars had been free-of-charge , Friedman replied that previous lectures had not been free-of-charge in a meaningful sense : lectures always have related costs . What mattered was whether attendees or non-attendees covered those costs . Friedman thought that it was fairer that only those who attended paid . In this discussion Friedman also stated that he did not receive any money for delivering that lecture .",
      "Estonia .",
      "Although Friedman never visited Estonia , his book Free to Choose influenced Estonias then 32-year-old prime minister , Mart Laar , who has claimed that it was the only book on economics he had read before taking office . Laars reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming Estonia from an impoverished Soviet Republic to the Baltic Tiger . A prime element of Laars program was introduction of the flat tax . Laar won the 2006 Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty , awarded by the Cato Institute .",
      "United Kingdom .",
      "After 1950 Friedman was frequently invited to lecture in Britain , and by the 1970s his ideas had gained widespread attention in conservative circles . For example , he was a regular speaker at the Institute of Economic Affairs ( IEA ) , a libertarian think tank . Conservative politician Margaret Thatcher closely followed IEA programs and ideas , and met Friedman there in 1978 . He also strongly influenced Keith Joseph , who became Thatchers senior advisor on economic affairs , as well as Alan Walters and Patrick Minford , two other key advisers . Major newspapers , including the Daily Telegraph , The Times , and The Financial Times all promulgated Friedmans monetarist ideas to British decision-makers . Friedmans ideas strongly influenced Thatcher and her allies when she became Prime Minister in 1979 .",
      "United States .",
      "After his death a number of obituaries and articles were written in Friedmans honor , citing him as one of the most important and influential economists of the post-war era . Milton Friedmans somewhat controversial legacy in America remains strong within the conservative movement . However , some journalists and economists like Noah Smith and Scott Sumner have argued Friedmans academic legacy has been buried under his political philosophy and misinterpreted by modern conservatives .",
      "Criticism .",
      "Econometrician David Hendry criticized part of Friedmans and Anna Schwartzs 1982 Monetary Trends . When asked about it during an interview with Icelandic TV in 1984 , Friedman said that the criticism referred to a different problem from that which he and Schwartz had tackled , and hence was irrelevant , and pointed out the lack of consequential peer review amongst econometricians on Hendrys work . In 2006 , Hendry said that Friedman was guilty of serious errors of misunderstanding that meant the t-ratios he reported for UK money demand were overstated by nearly 100 per cent , and said that , in a paper published in 1991 with Neil Ericsson , he had refuted almost every empirical claim .. . made about UK money demand by Friedman and Schwartz . A 2004 paper updated and confirmed the validity of the Hendry\u2013Ericsson findings through 2000 .",
      "Although Keynesian Nobel laureate Paul Krugman praised Friedman as a great economist and a great man after Friedmans death in 2006 , and acknowledged his many , widely accepted contributions to empirical economics , Krugman had been , and remains , a prominent critic of Friedman . Krugman has written that he slipped all too easily into claiming both that markets always work and that only markets work . Its extremely hard to find cases in which Friedman acknowledged the possibility that markets could go wrong , or that government intervention could serve a useful purpose . Others agree Friedman was not open enough to the possibility of market inefficiencies . Economist Noah Smith argues that while Friedman made many important contributions to economic theory not all of his ideas relating to macroeconomics have entirely held up over the years and that too few people are willing to challenge them .",
      "Political scientist C.B . Macpherson disagreed with Friedmans historical assessment of economic freedom leading to political freedom , suggesting that political freedom actually gave way to economic freedom for property-owning elites . He also challenged the notion that markets efficiently allocated resources and rejected Friedmans definition of liberty . Friedmans positivist methodological approach to economics has also been critiqued and debated . Finnish economist Uskali M\u00e4ki argued some of his assumptions were unrealistic and vague .",
      "In her book The Shock Doctrine , author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedmans economic liberalism , identifying it with the principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups in countries such as Chile and Argentina . Based on their assessments of the extent to which what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality , both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations .",
      "Friedman has been criticized by some prominent Austrian economists , including Murray Rothbard and Walter Block . Block called Friedman a socialist , and was critical of his support for a central banking system , saying First and foremost , this economist supported the Federal Reserve System all throughout his professional life . That organization of course does not own the money stock , but controls it . Friedman was an inveterate hater of the gold standard , denigrating its advocates as gold bugs .",
      "Visit to Chile .",
      "Because of his involvement with the government of Chile , which was a dictatorship , there were international protests , spenning from Sweden to America when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in 1976 . Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet , and a controversial seven-day trip he took to Chile during March 1975 ( less than two years after the coup that ended with the death of President Salvador Allende ) . Friedman answered that he was never an adviser to the dictatorship , but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation , and met with officials , including Augusto Pinochet the head of the military dictatorship , while in Chile .",
      "Chilean economist Orlando Letelier asserted that Pinochets dictatorship resorted to oppression because of popular opposition to Chicago School policies in Chile . After a 1991 speech on drug legalization , Friedman answered a question on his involvement with the Pinochet regime , saying that he was never an advisor to Pinochet ( also mentioned in his 1984 Iceland interview ) , but that a group of his students at the University of Chicago were involved in Chiles economic reforms . Friedman credited these reforms with high levels of economic growth and with the establishment of democracy that has subsequently occurred in Chile . In October 1988 , after returning from a lecture tour of China during which he had met with Zhao Ziyang , General Secretary of the Communist Party of China , Friedman wrote to The Stanford Daily asking if he should anticipate a similar avalanche of protests for having been willing to give advice to so evil a government ? And if not , why not ?",
      "Criticism of A Monetary History of the United States .",
      "Although the book was described by the Cato Institute as among the greatest economics books in the 20th century , and A Monetary History of the United States is widely considered to be among the most influential economics books ever made , it has endured criticisms for its conclusion that the Federal Reserve was to blame for the Great Depression . Some economists , including noted Friedman critic Peter Temin have raised questions about the legitimacy of Friedmans claims about whether or not monetary quantity levels were endogenous rather than exogenously determined , as A Monetary History of the United States posits . Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman argued that the 2008 recession proved that , during a recession , a central bank cannot control broad money ( M3 money , as defined by the OECD ) , and even if it can , the money supply does not bear a direct or proven relationship with GDP . According to Krugman , this was true in the 1930s , and the claim that the Federal Reserve could have avoided the Great Depression by reacting to what Friedman called The Great Contraction is highly dubious .",
      "James Tobin questioned the importance of velocity of money , and how informative this measure of the frequency of transactions is to understanding the various fluctuations observed in A Monetary History of the United States .",
      "Economic Historian Barry Eichengreen argued that because of the gold standard , which was at this point in time the chief monetary system of the world , the Federal Reserves hands were tied . This was because , in order to retain the credibility of the gold standard , the Federal Reserve could not undertake actions like dramatically expanding the money supply as proposed by Friedman and Schwartz .",
      "Austrian economist Murray Rothbard criticized Friedmans conclusions , and argued they are inconsistent with data , because during the period described by Friedman as The Great Contraction , the money supply increased . Friedman and Schwartz argued that the Great Depression happened as a result of a deflationary spiral which , according to Rothbard , is inconsistent with data .",

      "Wanhua-BorsodChem is a Hungarian chemical raw material manufacturing company headquartered in Kazincbarcika , Northern Hungary . It is the European member of the Wanhua Chemical Group . The company specializes in isocyanates ( MDI , TDI ) , PVC and chlor-alkali ( vinyl ) businesses . The main production site is located in Kazincbarcika , Hungary but the production is also supported by other European production capacities located in Ostrava , the Czech Republic and K\u0119dzierzyn-Ko\u017ale , Poland . Several branch offices are available in Hungary , Belgium , the Czech Republic , Croatia , Italy and Poland . Since 2008 a new R&D and technical support center was established in G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 .",
      "History .",
      "Beginnings .",
      "The establishment of the Borsodi Vegyi Kombin\u00e1t ( BVK ) the predecessor of Wanhua-BorsodChem , was decided at the end of 1949 , based on the Borsod coal , the water of the Saj\u00f3 , the proximity of the road and the railway . In the new industrial area , a decision was made to build a coal classifier , a coking plant , a coal-fired power plant and a Lignite-based chemical plant ( nitrogen plant ) , as well as service plants , with a budget allocation of HUF 1 billion . The giant investment took place between 1950 and 1955 , and was inaugurated on 10 December 1955 . It became the largest industrial facility in the country at the time . Deficiencies and errors made during construction delayed the start of continuous production for 3 years .",
      "PVC era .",
      "The year 1963 brought the biggest changes in BVKs life to date . They switched to the production of natural gas-based synthesis gas , and in parallel , coke-based operations were discontinued . They merged with the Berente Chemical Works and launched the Olefin I program , under which the production of thermoplastic polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) began for the first time in the country . They built their mercury cathode chlorine and hydrochloric acid plant .",
      "The second expansion of the nitrogen plant began in 1964 , during which the construction of their urea plant was also started . In 1969 , the PVC-II Factory , which also produces PVC powder , was put into operation . At that time , BVK was the 6th largest company in the Hungarian chemical industry in terms of headcount .",
      "A modern plastic factory capable of producing 150,000 tons of PVC per year was built in 1971 . This became the largest chemical investment in Hungary to date . Three years later , the expansion continued with the construction of a new PVC plant ( PVC III ) , which was built on oil instead of natural gas and processed ethylene purchased from the Tiszai Vegyi Kombin\u00e1t ( TVK ) . From the early 1980s , great emphasis was placed on plastic processing . In 1983 , the mixing plant and the PVC window plant , the last plants in the program , were put into operation and the installation of the phosgene plant was completed .",

      "On 1 August 1991 , as the legal successor to the 1949-founded Borsodi Vegyi Kombin\u00e1t , the company BorsodChem was officially established . BorsodChem has become one of the largest chemical companies in Hungary . In 1996 , it became the first company to register its shares on the Budapest Stock Exchange as well as the London Stock Exchange . In 2000 , he bought 28.5 percent of the shares of Tiszai Vegyi Kombin\u00e1t , which were later resold to MOL .",

      "James Marape ( born 24 April 1971 ) is a Papua New Guinean politician , who is serving as the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea since May 2019 ; he has been a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea since July 2007 , representing the electorate of Tari-Pori Open in Hela Province in the highlands . He held Cabinet Posts as Minister of Education ( 2008\u20132011 ) and Minister of Finance ( 2012\u20132019 ) .",
      "Early career .",
      "Marape was born in 1971 in Tari , Hela Province ( then in Southern Highlands Province ) . He attended Minj Primary School and Kabiufa Adventist Secondary School in the PNG highlands . Marape graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Papua New Guinea in 1993 , and a postgraduate Honours Degree in Environmental Science in 2000 .",
      "He has a background in managerial functions . From 1994 to 1995 , he was Officer in charge at the PNG Institute of Medical Research , Tari Branch . From 1996 to 1998 , he was Operations Manager of GDC at the Hides Gas project . After obtaining his honors degree , he became Acting Assistant Secretary of Policy with the Department of Personnel Management from 2001 to 2006 .",
      "Political career .",
      "His entry into politics was tumultuous . Marape first contested the Tari-Pori seat at the 2002 election for the Peoples Progress Party , when voting in the Southern Highlands Province was cancelled due to widespread violence . He contested the supplementary election in 2003 but lost to incumbent MP Tom Tomiape in a contest marred by the bashing of a polling official by his supporters . He challenged the result in the Court of Disputed Returns , but both his initial petition and a subsequent appeal were rejected .",
      "He contested the seat for a second time at the 2007 election and defeated Tomiape . He won the subsequent parliamentary elections in Tari-Pori ( 2012 and 2017 ) . He obtained in 2017 50%+1 of the vote ( 30,192 votes ) and this is unusual in PNGs Limited PV system . A challenge by the second runner up Justin Haiara was dismissed by the National Court .",
      "Prime Minister Michael Somare gave him major parliamentary responsibilities after his win in 2007 : Parliamentary Secretary for Works , Transport and Civil Aviation , Deputy Chair of the Privileges Committee and member of the Parliamentary Referral Committee on Inter-Government Relations. [ He was Minister for Education from 16 December 2008 to 2 August 2011 . He was then a member of Somares National Alliance Party . In February 2012 , he left the National Alliance Party and joined the party of Prime Minister ONeill , the Peoples National Congress ( PNC ) . ONeill appointed him as Minister of Finance in 2012 .",
      "On 11 April 2019 , he resigned as Minister of Finance but remained a member of Peoples National Congress and the Government . However , he resigned from the party on 29 April 2019 . Sam Basil was appointed as Minister for Finance on 18 April 2019 .",
      "Ministerial succession .",
      "He resigned from PNC soon after his resignation as Cabinet Minister . Marape joined the MPs plotting a vote of no confidence in the ONeill government . He was elected as alternate Prime Minister on 7th of May 2019 . On the 17th of May the Ombudsman Commission recommended a leadership tribunal to judge ONeill and Marape on the UBS loan to acquire shares in Oil Search Limited . That was mentioned as the reason for Marapes replacement as alternate MP by Patrick Pruaitch on 28 of May 2019 . Marape introduced Patrick Pruaitch as alternate MP and declared that the vote for Pruaitch was by consensus . Peter O\u2019Neill had then resigned as Prime Minister on 26th of May . However , Marape and not Pruaitch emerged from the succession struggle . Marape and 26 opposition MPs that had belonged to PNC returned to the PNC . As a result , the opposition did not have the numbers anymore for a vote of no confidence . The resignation of ONeill necessitated the election of a new Prime Minister . Marape obtained in the subsequent election 101 votes as compared to 8 for Mekere Morauta .",
      "ONeill expected that his Cabinet would continue as usual with him as parliamentary leader instead of Prime Minister . However , Marape appointed people who had opposed the ONeill/Able government . After a few months , Marape clashed with ONeill and directed him to the opposition benches , Marape had joined Pangu Party before he rejoined PNC . In August 2019 , he accepted the leadership of Pangu Party.In a Cabinet reshuffle on 8th of November Marape replaced most of the Cabinet Ministers . ONeill continues to be critical . He opposes especially Marapes view of the economy . He stresses that Marape is as responsible for the state of affairs as ONeill : he was minister of finance .",
      "Attempted vote of no confidence .",
      "On 10th of November 2020 Marape was confronted by an attempt to topple him from power . A motion of no confidence in the Marape government could be mounted after 30th of November as the grace period for a new cabinet expired then . A motion by Belden Namah was accepted ( 57-39 ) to adjourn Parliament to 1st of December with the intention to mount a vote on such a motion . Those who voted with Namah , 55 in number , went in a so-called \u201dcamp\u201d in Vanimo , the constituency of Belden . They comprised among others of 11 Cabinet ministers , 3 ex Prime Ministers and 4 ex Deputy Prime Ministers , Marape retorted by starting a \u201ccamp\u201d on Loloata island near Port Moresby . Fifty thee MP went with him . At that time there were 110 elective members of parliament and the competition was therefore close .",
      "Marape resorted to well known tactics . First , he used an interpretation of the rules of parliament , Namahs motion was accepted with the deputy speaker -Koni Iguan- in charge . He joined the camp in Vanimo . Speaker Job Pomat then overruled the motion by Namah on the grounds that only a Minister is allowed to propose a parliament adjournment , Parliament was recalled and on 17 of November -with the opposition absent in Vanimo- the budget for 2021 was passed . This had been shelved by the opposition until after the vote of no confidence . Marape argued that it could not wait because it had to function in international negotiations . Job Pomat , the speaker supported throughout the procedures the Marape government . Parliament was then adjourned until April 2021.Second , the Private Business committee of parliament is crucial to get a vote of no confidence on the agenda . Namah had in his initiative replaced the members of that committee with supporters in the opposition . Marape reversed this and brought his own supporters on the committee in the session of 17th of November",
      "Peter O\u2019Neill had fronted with Namah the opposition movement and brought a case before the Supreme Court to declare the budget sitting on 17th of November unconstitutional . The Supreme Court ruled in his favour and the decisions taken then were invalid . The Speaker recalled parliament on the 14th of December .",
      "The most important issue in this meeting was filing a motion of no confidence with the Private Business committee by Belden Namah . The opposition proposed Patrick Pruaitch as alternate prime minister . In that session the opposition had support of 55 members as compared to 32",
      "The vote of no confidence was never tabled when parliament reconvened on 16 December , Eighteen MPs crossed the floor from the opposition to the government benches and therefore brought the governments support to 70 , a solid majority . Sam Basil , the previous deputy prime minister went back to his old place . The competition for alternate prime ministership between Patrick Pruaitch and Sam Basil had been decided in favour of the former to the dismay of Basil and his followers . They returned in protest to the government benches .",
      "It was perceived as an attempt to regain power by the old guard . Marape presented a confident New Years Message in which he also stressed the generational change in PNG politics . He also said that the old guard had a record in which there was little to be proud of .",
      "Personal life .",
      "James Marape is a member and leader of the Huli people , one of the countrys largest tribes and ethnic groups . Marapes father was a Seventh-day Adventist pastor with Marape identifying with the church as well . Marape is married to Rachael Marape , who is originally from East Sepik Province . The couple have six children .",
      "On being sworn in , Marape said he wants Papua New Guinea to be the richest black Christian nation in the world .",

      "Walter Mazzarri",
      "Walter Mazzarri ( ; born 1 October 1961 ) is an Italian former footballer and head coach .",
      "After coaching several smaller Italian sides , Mazzarri took up a managerial position with Sampdoria in 2007 ; with the help of the attacking partnership of Antonio Cassano and Giampaolo Pazzini , he led the team to qualify for the UEFA Cup in his first season , and subsequently reached the Coppa Italia final the next year . In 2009 , he joined Napoli , where he implemented a 3\u20134\u20133 formation with which he later became associated . With the attacking trio of Ezequiel Lavezzi , Edinson Cavani and Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk , he helped the team qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the clubs history in 2011 , and won the Coppa Italia the following season , the clubs first trophy in over 20 years . In his final season with the team , he managed a second-place finish in Serie A , the clubs best league finish in over 20 years .",
      "In 2013 , he moved to Internazionale , but was later sacked halfway through his second season with the club . He later managed Torino in Serie A , and had one year in charge of Watford in Englands Premier League in 2016\u201317 .",
      "Playing career .",
      "Mazzarri , a midfielder and a product of Fiorentinas youth system , made his professional debut in 1981 for Pescara of Serie B , and played a short Serie A stint in Cagliari the following season , before being sold to Reggiana . He had his longest period at Empoli , who won promotion to Serie A for the first time during his time with the Tuscan side . After several spells with mostly minor teams , including a two-year stint with Acireale where he was part of the team who won a historic first promotion to Serie B , and then playing in the Italian second tier in 1993\u201394 , Mazzarri ended his playing career in 1995 with Sassari Torres .",
      "Managerial career .",
      "Early years .",
      "Mazzarri started his coaching career as Renzo Ulivieris assistant at Napoli in 1998 . His first spell in charge came in 2001\u201302 for Sicilian Serie C2 team Acireale , where he had been a player from 1992 to 1994 . Subsequently , he returned to his native Tuscany to coach Pistoiese of Serie C1 in 2002\u201303 and Livorno of Serie B in 2003\u201304 , bringing the amaranto led by Cristiano Lucarelli back to Serie A . He was coach of Reggina from 2004 to 2007 , leading the Calabrian side to Serie A survival in three consecutive seasons , the last obtained on the final day of the season despite an 11-point deduction . In May 2007 , Mazzarri was made an honorary citizen of Reggio Calabria , after helping the club avoid relegation during the 2006\u201307 Serie A season .",
      "Sampdoria .",
      "On 31 May 2007 he was announced as new Sampdoria coach . He served as Sampdoria boss for two seasons , overseeing a considerable improvement in results , thanks to the likes of the attacking duo of Antonio Cassano , who publicly praised Mazzarris coaching abilities , and Giampaolo Pazzini . Sampdorias 2007\u201308 campaign ended in an impressive sixth place , which ensured qualification for the UEFA Cup . Mazzarris fortunes declined slightly in 2008\u201309 , as the blucerchiati ended their campaign in 13th place ; despite this , he managed to guide his team into the Coppa Italia Final , notably defeating champions Inter 3\u20131 on aggregate in the semi-finals , before losing on penalties to Lazio in the final . Mazzarri left Sampdoria by mutual consent at the end of the 2008\u201309 season .",
      "Napoli .",
      "On 6 October 2009 he was appointed manager of Napoli , replacing Roberto Donadoni . He finished his debut season in sixth place in Serie A , and was handed a new three-year contract at the end of the campaign .",
      "In 2010\u201311 , Mazzarris Napoli finished third in the league and qualified directly for the group phase of the 2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League \u2013 their first time in Europes premier competition in 21 years . His team were known for an attacking 3\u20134\u20133 formation with a frontline of Ezequiel Lavezzi , Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk and Edinson Cavani . They finished second in their Champions League group , behind Bayern Munich but ahead of Manchester City and Villareal , to meet Chelsea in the last 16 . Napoli won 3\u20131 at home in the first leg ; they were subsequently beaten 4\u20131 at Stamford Bridge after extra time , being eliminated by the eventual champions .",
      "Napoli won the 2012 Coppa Italia Final over undefeated league champions Juventus on 20 May ; this was Juventuss only loss of the season , and Napolis first title in over 20 years . On 11 August that year , the club suffered a controversial 4\u20132 extra-time defeat to Juventus in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana , which saw two Napoli players sent off as well as Mazzarri . He left the Azzurri on 19 May 2013 , after leading them to a 2nd-place finish and a spot in the Champions League at the end of the 2012\u201313 Serie A season ; this was the clubs best league finish in over 20 years .",
      "Inter .",
      "Mazzarri was officially appointed as the Inter manager on 24 May 2013 , after Andrea Stramaccioni was dismissed for a poor performance in the 2012\u201313 season . On 2 July 2014 , he signed a one-year extension to tie him to the team until 30 June 2016 .",
      "He was sacked by Inter after a series of disappointing results on 14 November 2014 , leaving the club in ninth place . He parted with the club before the 12th matchday , while they were five points below their season objective of the third position .",
      "Watford .",
      "On 21 May 2016 , Watford confirmed they had reached an agreement with Mazzarri to become Head Coach from 1 July 2016 on a three-year contract . He joined a club owned by his compatriot Giampaolo Pozzo , and worked without being able to speak English .",
      "Mazzarri secured Watfords Premier League status that season , finishing one place above relegation in 17th , a four-place dip on their previous campaign . It was announced on 17 May 2017 that his contract would be terminated at the end of his first season at the club .",
      "Torino .",
      "On 4 January 2018 , Mazzarri was appointed manager of Torino , replacing Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107 . With a 7th-place finish in 2018\u201319 he led the Granata to the UEFA Europa League , where they were eliminated in the play-off round by Wolverhampton Wanderers .",
      "On 4 February 2020 , Mazzarri was dismissed following back-to-back 7\u20130 and 4\u20130 defeats to Atalanta and Lecce , respectively .",

      "The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City , the other being the National Leagues ( NL ) New York Mets . The Yankees began play in the season as the Baltimore Orioles ( no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles ) . In 1903 , Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise after it ceased operations and moved it to New York City , renaming the club the New York Highlanders . The Highlanders were officially renamed the New York Yankees in .",
      "The team is owned by Yankee Global Enterprises , an LLC that is controlled by the family of the late George Steinbrenner , who purchased the team in 1973 . Brian Cashman is the teams general manager , and Aaron Boone is the teams field manager . The teams home games were played at the original Yankee Stadium from 1923 to 1973 and from 1976 to 2008 . In 1974 and 1975 , the Yankees shared Shea Stadium with the Mets , in addition to the New York Jets and the New York Giants . In 2009 , they moved into a new ballpark of the same name that was constructed adjacent to the previous facility , which was closed and demolished . The team is perennially among the leaders in MLB attendance .",
      "Arguably the most successful professional sports team in the United States , the Yankees have won 19 American League East Division titles , 40 American League pennants , and 27 World Series championships , all of which are MLB records . The team has won more titles than any other franchise in the four major North American sports leagues - after briefly trailing the NHLs Montreal Canadiens by one or two titles in the 1990s . Forty-four Yankees players and 11 Yankees managers have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame , including Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Mickey Mantle , Yogi Berra , Whitey Ford , Mariano Rivera , and Derek Jeter , with Rivera and Jeter having the two highest vote percentages of all Hall of Fame members . According to Forbes , the Yankees are the second-highest valued sports franchise in the United States and the second in the world , with an estimated value of approximately $5 billion . The team has garnered enormous popularity and a dedicated fanbase , as well as widespread enmity from fans of other MLB teams . The teams rivalry with the Boston Red Sox is one of the most well-known rivalries in North American sports .",

      "History .",
      "1901\u20131902 : Origins in Baltimore .",
      "In 1900 , Ban Johnson , the president of a minor league known as the Western League ( 1894\u20131899 ) , changed the Western League name to the American League ( AL ) and asked the National League to classify it as a major league . Johnson held that his league would operate in friendly terms with the National League , but the National League ridiculed the plan . Johnson declared official major league status for his league in 1901 .",
      "Plans to add a team in New York City were blocked by the NLs New York Giants . A team was instead placed in Baltimore , Maryland , in 1901 named the Orioles . Between 1901 and 1903 , many players and coaches on the Orioles roster jumped to the Giants . In January 1903 , a peace conference was held between the two leagues to settle disputes and try to coexist . At the conference , Johnson requested that an AL team be put in New York , to play alongside the NLs Giants . It was put to a vote , and 15 of the 16 major league owners agreed on it . The Orioles new owners , Frank J . Farrell and William S . Devery moved the team to New York in 1903 .",
      "1903\u20131912 : Move to New York and the Highlanders years .",
      "The teams new ballpark , Hilltop Park ( formally known as American League Park ) , was constructed in one of Upper Manhattans highest points\u2014between 165th and 168th Streets . The team was named the New York Highlanders . Fans believed the name was chosen because of the teams elevated location in Upper Manhattan , or as a nod to team president Joseph Gordons Scottish-Irish heritage ( the Gordon Highlanders were a well known Scottish military unit ) .",
      "Initially , the team was commonly referred to as the New York Americans . The team was also referred to as the Invaders in the Evening Journal . New York Press Sports Editor Jim Price coined the unofficial nickname Yankees ( or Yanks ) for the club as early as 1904 , because it was easier to fit in headlines .",
      "The Highlanders finished second in the AL in 1904 , 1906 , and 1910 . In 1904 , they lost the deciding game to the Boston Americans , who later became the Boston Red Sox . That year , Highlander pitcher Jack Chesbro set the single-season wins record at 41 . At this time there was no formal World Series agreement wherein the AL and NL winners would play each other .",
      "1913\u20131922 : New owners , a new home , and a new name : Years at the Polo Grounds .",
      "The original Polo Grounds burned down in 1911 and the Highlanders shared Hilltop Park with the Giants during a two-month renovation period . Later , from 1913 to 1922 , the Highlanders shared the Polo Grounds with the Giants . While playing at the Polo Grounds , the name Highlanders fell into disuse among the press . In 1913 the team became officially known as the New York Yankees .",
      "By the middle of the decade , Yankees owners Farrell and Devery had become estranged and in need of money . At the start of 1915 , they sold the team to Colonel Jacob Ruppert , a brewer , and Captain Tillinghast LHommedieu Huston , a contractor-engineer .",
      "1923\u20131935 : Sluggers and the Stadium : Ruth , Gehrig , and Murderers Row .",
      "In the years around 1920 , the Yankees , the Red Sox , and the Chicago White Sox had a d\u00e9tente . The trades between the three ball clubs antagonized Ban Johnson and garnered the teams the nickname The Insurrectos . This d\u00e9tente paid off well for the Yankees as they increased their payroll . Most new players who later contributed to the teams success came from the Red Sox , whose owner , Harry Frazee , was trading them for large sums of money to finance his theatrical productions . Pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth was the most talented of all the acquisitions from Boston , and the outcome of that trade would haunt the Red Sox for the next 86 years , a span in which the team did not win a single World Series championship . This phenomenon eventually became known as the Curse of the Bambino as the failure of the Red Sox and the success of the Yankees seemed almost supernatural , and seemed to stem from that one trade . However , it was not until 1990 when Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe wrote a book with the same title that the curse was publicized .",
      "Ruths multitude of home runs proved so popular that the Yankees began drawing more people than their National League counterpart , the Giants . In 1921 \u2014 the year after acquiring Ruth \u2014 the Yankees played in their first World Series . They competed against the Giants , and all eight games of the series were played in the Polo Grounds . After the 1922 season , the Yankees were told to move out of the Polo Grounds . Giants manager John McGraw was said to have commented that the Yankees should move to some out-of-the-way place , like Queens , but they instead broke ground for a new ballpark in the Bronx , right across the Harlem River from the Polo Grounds . In 1922 , the Yankees returned to the World Series again and were dealt a second defeat at the hands of the Giants . Manager Miller Huggins and general manager Ed Barrow were important newcomers in this period . The hiring of Huggins by Ruppert in 1918 caused a rift between the owners that eventually led to Ruppert buying Huston out in 1923 .",
      "In 1923 , the Yankees moved to their new home , Yankee Stadium , which took 11 months to build and cost $2.5 million . The team announced that 99,200 fans showed up on Opening Day and 25,000 were turned away . In the first game at Yankee Stadium , Ruth hit a home run . The stadium was nicknamed The House That Ruth Built , due mainly to the fact that Ruth had doubled Yankees attendance , which helped the team pay for the new stadium . At the end of the season , the Yankees faced the Giants in the World Series for the third straight year and won their first championship .",
      "In the 1927 season , the Yankees featured a lineup that became known as Murderers Row , and some consider this team to be the best in the history of baseball ( though similar claims have been made for other Yankee squads , notably those of 1939 , 1961 and 1998 ) .",
      "That season , the Yankees became the first team in baseball to occupy first place every day of the season , winning 110 games . The team also swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series . Ruths home run total of 60 in 1927 set a single-season home run record that stood until it was broken by Roger Maris in 1961 , although Maris had eight additional games in which to break the record . Meanwhile , first baseman Lou Gehrig had his first big season , batting .373 with 47 home runs and 175 RBI , beating Ruths single-season RBI mark ( 171 in 1921 ) . The Yankees won the World Series again in 1928 .",
      "In 1931 , Joe McCarthy was hired as manager and brought the Yankees back to the top of the AL . They swept the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series , and brought the teams streak of consecutive World Series game wins to 12 . This series was made famous by Babe Ruths Called Shot in game three of the series at Wrigley Field , a fitting swan song to his illustrious World Series career . In 1935 , Ruth left the Yankees to join the NLs Boston Braves , and he made his last major league baseball appearance on May 30 of that year .",
      "1936\u20131951 : Joltin Joe DiMaggio .",
      "After Ruth left the Yankees following the 1934 season , Gehrig finally had a chance to take center stage , but it was only one year before a new star appeared , Joe DiMaggio . The team won an unprecedented four straight World Series titles from 1936 to 1939 . For most of 1939 , however , they had to do it without Gehrig , who took himself out of the lineup on May 2 and retired due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , which was later known as Lou Gehrigs Disease in his memory . The Yankees declared July 4 , 1939 to be Lou Gehrig Day , on which they retired his number 4 , the first retired number in baseball . Gehrig made a famous speech in which he declared himself to be the luckiest man on the face of the earth . He died two years later on June 2 , 1941 .",
      "The 1941 season was often described as the last year of the Golden Era before the United States entered World War II and other realities intervened . It was a thrilling year as America watched two major events unfold : Ted Williams of the Red Sox hitting for the elusive .400 batting average and Joe DiMaggio getting hits in consecutive ballgames . By the end of his hitting streak , DiMaggio hit in 56 consecutive games , the current major league record and one often deemed unbreakable .",
      "Two months after the Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1941 World Series\u2014the first of seven October meetings between the two crosstown rivals before the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles\u2014the United States naval fleet was attacked at Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan , and many of their best players , including DiMaggio , entered the military during World War II . The Yankees still managed to pull out a win against the St . Louis Cardinals in the 1943 World Series .",
      "In 1945 construction magnate Del Webb and partners Dan Topping and Larry MacPhail purchased the team from the Ruppert estate for $2.8 million ; MacPhail was bought out in 1947 .",
      "After a few slumping seasons , McCarthy was fired early in 1946 . A few interim managers later , Bucky Harris took the job , righting the ship and taking the Yankees to a hard-fought series victory against the Dodgers .",
      "Despite finishing only three games behind the Cleveland Indians in the 1948 pennant race , Harris was relieved of his duties and replaced by Casey Stengel , who had a reputation of being a clown and managing bad teams . His tenure as Yankees field manager , however , was marked with success . The underdog Yankees came from behind to catch and surprise a powerful Red Sox team on the last two days of the 1949 season , a face-off that fueled the beginning of the modern Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry . By this time , however , DiMaggios career was winding down , and the Yankee Clipper retired after the 1951 season . This year marked the arrival of the Oklahoma Kid , Mickey Mantle , who was one of several new stars to fill the gap .",
      "1951\u20131959 : Stengels Squad .",
      "Bettering the clubs managed by Joe McCarthy , the Yankees won the World Series five consecutive times from \u2013 under Stengel , which remains an MLB record . Led by players like center fielder Mickey Mantle , pitcher Whitey Ford , and catcher Yogi Berra , Stengels teams won ten pennants and seven World Series titles in his 12 seasons as the Yankees manager . The title was the only one of those five championships not to be won against either the New York Giants or Brooklyn Dodgers ; it was won in four straight games against the Whiz Kids of the Philadelphia Phillies .",
      "In 1954 , the Yankees won 103 games , but the Cleveland Indians took the pennant with a then-AL record 111 wins ; 1954 was famously referred to as The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant . In , the Dodgers finally beat the Yankees in the World Series , after five previous Series losses to them . The Yankees came back strong the next year . In Game 5 of the 1956 World Series against the Dodgers , pitcher Don Larsen threw the only perfect game in World Series history , which remains the only perfect game in postseason play and the only postseason no-hitter until 2010 .",
      "The Yankees lost the 1957 World Series to the Milwaukee Braves when Lew Burdette incredibly won three games for the Braves . Following the Series , the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers both left for San Francisco and Los Angeles , respectively . This left the Yankees as New Yorks only baseball team . In the 1958 World Series , the Yankees got their revenge against the Braves and became the second team to win the Series after being down 3\u20131 . For the decade , the Yankees won six World Series championships ( 1950 , 1951 , 1952 , 1953 , 1956 , 1958 ) and eight American League pennants ( those six plus 1955 and 1957 ) . Led by Mantle , Ford , Berra , Elston Howard ( the Yankees first African-American player ) , and the newly acquired Roger Maris , the Yankees entered the 1960s seeking to replicate their success of the 1950s .",
      "1960\u20131964 : Mantle and Maris .",
      "Arnold Johnson , owner of the Kansas City Athletics , was a longtime business associate of then-Yankees co-owners Del Webb and Dan Topping . Because of this special relationship with the Yankees , he traded young players to them in exchange for cash and aging veterans . Invariably , these trades ended up being heavily tilted in the Yankees favor , leading to accusations that the Athletics were little more than a Yankees farm team at the major league level . Kansas City had been home to the Yankees top farm team for almost 20 years before the Athletics moved there from Philadelphia in 1954 .",
      "In 1960 , Charles O . Finley purchased the Athletics and put an end to the trades . At that point , however , the Yankees had already strengthened their supply of future prospects , which included a young outfielder named Roger Maris . In 1960 , Maris led the league in slugging percentage , RBI , and extra-base hits . He finished second in home runs ( one behind Mickey Mantle ) and total bases , and won a Gold Glove , which garnered enough votes for the American League MVP award .",
      "The year 1961 was one of the most memorable in Yankees history . Mantle and Maris hit home runs at a fast pace and became known as the M&M Boys . Ultimately , a severe hip infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup . Maris continued though , and on October 1 , the last day of the regular season , he hit home run number 61 , surpassing Babe Ruths single-season home run record of 60 . However , MLB Commissioner Ford Frick ( who , as it was discovered later , had ghostwritten for Babe Ruth during his career ) decreed that since Maris had played in a 162-game season , and Ruth ( in 1927 ) had played in a 154-game season , two separate records would be kept for 30 years , until MLB reversed course and Maris held the record alone . His record would be broken by Mark McGwire , who hit 70 home runs in 1998 . Maris still holds the American League record .",
      "The Yankees won the pennant with a 109\u201353 record and went on to defeat the Cincinnati Reds in the 1961 World Series . The team finished the year with a record 240 home runs .",
      "In 1962 , the sports scene in New York changed when the National League added an expansion team , the New York Mets , who played at the Giants former home , the Polo Grounds , for two seasons while Shea Stadium was under construction in nearby Flushing , Queens . This restored New York as a city with more than one team , as it had been from the late 1800s until 1957 . The Yankees won the 1962 World Series , their tenth in the past sixteen years , defeating the San Francisco Giants 4\u20133 . It was the Yankees last championship until 1977 .",
      "The Yankees easily reached the 1963 World Series when they won the pennant by 10.5 games , but they scored only four runs in the series and were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers and their ace pitcher , Sandy Koufax . After the season , Yogi Berra , who had just retired from playing , took over managerial duties . The aging Yankees returned the next year for a fifth straight World Series , but were beaten 4\u20133 by the St . Louis Cardinals . It would be the Yankees last World Series appearance until 1976 .",
      "1965\u20131972 : New ownership and a steep decline .",
      "After the 1964 season , CBS purchased 80% of the Yankees from Topping and Webb for $11.2 million . With the new ownership , the team began to decline . The 1965 edition of the team posted a record of 77\u201385 \u2014 the Yankees first losing record in 40 years .",
      "In 1966 , the Yankees finished in last place in the AL for the first time since 1912 . It also marked their first consecutive losing seasons since 1917 and 1918 . They finished next-to-last in 1967 . While their fortunes improved somewhat in the late 1960s and early 1970s , they only finished higher than fourth once during CBS ownership , in 1970 .",
      "The Yankees were not able to replace their aging superstars with promising young talent , as they had consistently done in the previous five decades . As early as the 1961\u201362 off-season , longtime fans noticed that the pipeline of talent had started to dry up . This was worsened by the introduction of the amateur draft that year , which meant that the Yankees could no longer sign any player they wanted . While the Yankees usually drafted fairly early during this period due to their lackluster records , Thurman Munson was the only pick who lived up to his billing .",
      "1973\u20131981 : Steinbrenner , Martin , Jackson , and Munson : the Bronx Zoo .",
      "A group of investors , led by Cleveland-based shipbuilder George Steinbrenner ( 1930\u20132010 ) , purchased the club from CBS in 1973 , for $8.7 million . Mike Burke stayed on as president until he quit in April . Within a year , Steinbrenner bought out most of his other partners and became the teams principal owner , although Burke continued to hold a minority share into the 1980s .",
      "One of Steinbrenners major goals was to renovate Yankee Stadium . It had greatly deteriorated by the late 1960s , and the surrounding neighborhood had gone south as well . CBS initially suggested renovations , but the team needed to play elsewhere , and the Mets refused to open their home , Shea Stadium , to the Yankees . A new stadium in the Meadowlands , across the Hudson River in New Jersey , was suggested ( and was eventually built , as Giants Stadium , specifically for football ) . Finally , in mid-1972 , Mayor John Lindsay stepped in . The city bought the stadium and began an extensive two-year renovation period . Since the city also owned Shea Stadium , the Mets were forced to allow the Yankees to play two seasons there . The renovations modernized the look of the stadium , significantly altered the dimensions , and reconfigured some of the seating .",
      "In 1973 , Steinbrenner started the rule as the second MLB team with a personal appearance policy that includes being clean-shaven , with long hair slicked back or trimmed . This rule is still in effect today , and enforced by his sons after Georges passing . The Cincinnati Reds had the same personal appearance policy from 1967 until 1999 .",
      "After the 1974 season , Steinbrenner made a move that started the modern era of free agency , signing star pitcher Catfish Hunter away from Oakland . Midway through the 1975 season , the team hired former second baseman Billy Martin as manager . With Martin at the helm , the Yankees reached the 1976 World Series , but were swept by the Cincinnati Reds and their famed Big Red Machine .",
      "After the 1976 campaign , Steinbrenner added star Oakland outfielder Reggie Jackson\u2014who had spent 1976 with the Baltimore Orioles\u2014to his roster . During spring training of 1977 , Jackson alienated his teammates with controversial remarks about the Yankees captain , catcher Thurman Munson . He had bad blood with manager Billy Martin , who had managed the Detroit Tigers when Jacksons Athletics defeated them in the 1972 playoffs . Jackson , Martin , and Steinbrenner repeatedly feuded with each other throughout Jacksons 5-year contract . Martin was hired and fired by Steinbrenner five times over the next 13 years . This conflict , combined with the extremely rowdy Yankees fans of the late 1970s and the bad conditions of the Bronx , led to the Yankees organization and stadium being referred to as the Bronx Zoo . Despite the turmoil , Jackson hit four home runs in 1977 World Series and earned the Series MVP Award , and the nickname Mr . October .",
      "Throughout the late 1970s , the race for the pennant was often a close competition between the Yankees and the Red Sox . On July 14 , 1978 , the Yankees were games behind the Red Sox . In late July , Martin suspended Reggie Jackson for defiance after he bunted while Martin had the swing signal on . Upon Jacksons return , Martin made a famous statement against both Jackson and owner Steinbrenner : They deserve each other . Ones a born liar ; the others convicted . Martin was forced to resign the next day and was replaced by Bob Lemon . This came while the team was winning five games in a row and Boston was losing five in a row .",
      "The Yankees continued to win games , making up ground and by the time they met Boston for a pivotal four-game series at Fenway Park in early September . Going into the series , the Yankees were four games behind the Red Sox . The Yankees swept the Red Sox in what became known as the Boston Massacre , winning the games 15\u20133 , 13\u20132 , 7\u20130 , and 7\u20134 . The third game was a shutout pitched by Louisiana Lightning Ron Guidry , who led the majors with nine shutouts , a 25\u20133 record , and a 1.74 ERA . On the last day of the season , the two clubs finished in a tie for first place in the AL East , and a tiebreaker game was held at Fenway Park . With Guidry pitching against former Yankee Mike Torrez , the Red Sox took an early 2\u20130 lead . In the seventh inning , light-hitting Yankee shortstop Bucky Dent drove a three-run home run over the Fenway Parks Green Monster , putting the Yankees up 3\u20132 . Reggie Jacksons solo home run in the following inning sealed the eventual 5\u20134 win that gave the Yankees their one-hundredth win of the season and their third straight AL East title . Guidry earned his 25th win of the season .",
      "After defeating the Kansas City Royals for the third consecutive year in the ALCS , the Yankees faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series . They lost the first two games in Los Angeles , but won all three games at Yankee Stadium and Game 6 back in Los Angeles , winning their 22nd World Championship .",
      "Changes occurred during the 1979 season . Former Cy Young Award-winning closer Sparky Lyle was traded to the Texas Rangers for several players , including Dave Righetti . Tommy John was acquired from the Dodgers and Luis Tiant from the Red Sox to bolster the pitching staff . During the season , Bob Lemon was replaced by Billy Martin .",
      "The 1970s ended on a tragic note for the Yankees . On August 2 , 1979 , catcher Thurman Munson died when his private plane crashed while he was practicing touch-and-go landings . Four days later , the entire team flew out to Canton , Ohio , for the funeral , despite having a game later that day against the Orioles . Martin adamantly stated that the funeral was more important and that he did not care if they made it back in time . Bobby Murcer , a close friend of Munsons , was chosen to give the eulogy at his funeral . In a nationally televised and emotional game , Murcer used Munsons bat ( which he gave to his fallen friends wife after the game ) , and drove in all five of the teams runs in a dramatic 5\u20134 walk-off victory . Before the game , Munsons locker sat empty except for his catching gear , a sad reminder for his teammates . His locker , labeled with his number 15 , has remained empty in the Yankees clubhouse as a memorial . When the Yankees moved across the street , Munsons locker was torn out and installed in the new Stadiums museum . The number 15 has been retired by the team .",
      "The 1980 season brought more changes . Billy Martin was fired once again and Dick Howser took his place . Chris Chambliss was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for catcher Rick Cerone . Reggie Jackson hit .300 for the only time in his career with 41 homers , and finished 2nd in the MVP voting to Kansas Citys George Brett . The Yankees won 103 games and the AL East by three games over the Baltimore Orioles , but were swept by the Royals in the ALCS .",
      "After the season ended , the Yankees signed Dave Winfield to a 10-year contract . The team fired Howser and replaced him with Gene Michael . Under Michael , the Yankees led the AL East before a strike hit in June 1981 . In the second half of the season , the Yankees struggled under Bob Lemon , who replaced Michael . Thanks to the split-season playoff format , the Yankees faced the second-half winner Milwaukee Brewers in the special 1981 American League Division Series . After defeating Milwaukee 3\u20132 , they swept the Oakland Athletics in a three-game ALCS . In the World Series , the Yankees won the first two games against the Los Angeles Dodgers . But the Dodgers fought back to win the next four games to claim the World Series title .",
      "1982\u20131995 : Struggles during the Mattingly years .",
      "Following the teams loss to the Dodgers in the 1981 World Series , the Yankees began their longest absence from the playoffs since 1921 . Following the example set by the St . Louis Cardinals and the Big Red Machine , Steinbrenner announced his plan to transform the Yankees from the Bronx Bombers into the Bronx Burners , increasing the Yankees ability to win games based on speed and defense instead of waiting around for a 3 run home run . As a first step towards this end , the Yankees signed Dave Collins from the Cincinnati Reds during the 1981 off-season . Collins was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays after the 1982 season in a deal that also included future All-Stars Fred McGriff and Mike Morgan . In return the Yankees got Dale Murray and Tom Dodd .",
      "The Yankees of the 1980s were led by All-Star first baseman Don Mattingly . In spite of accumulating the most total wins of any major league team , they failed to win a World Series ( the 1980s were the first decade since the 1910s in which the Yankees did not win at least two Series ) and had only two playoff appearances . Although they consistently had a powerful offense \u2014Mattingly at various times was teammate to Dave Winfield ( whom Mattingly battled for the AL batting title through most of the 1984 season ) , Rickey Henderson , Don Baylor , Ken Griffey , Sr. , Mike Pagliarulo , Steve Sax , and Jesse Barfield , and the Yankees led MLB in runs scored for the decade \u2014 the Yankees teams of the 1980s lacked sufficient starting pitching to win a championship . After posting a 22\u20136 record in 1985 , arm problems caught up with Guidry , and his performance declined over the next three years . Of the remaining mainstays of the Yankees rotation , only Dave Righetti stood out , pitching a no-hitter on July 4 , 1983 , but he was moved to the bullpen the next year where he helped to define the closer role . Despite the Yankees lack of pitching success during the 1980s , they had three of the premier pitchers of the early 1990s on their roster during these years in Al Leiter , Doug Drabek and Jos\u00e9 Rijo . All were mismanaged and dealt away before they could reach their full potential , with only Rijo returning much value \u2013 he was traded to the Oakland As in the deal that brought Henderson to New York .",
      "The team came close to winning the AL East in 1985 and 1986 , finishing second to the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox , respectively , but fell to fourth place in 1987 and fifth in 1988 , despite having mid-season leads in the AL East both years .",
      "By the end of the decade , the Yankees offense declined . Henderson and Pagliarulo had departed by the middle of 1989 , while back problems hampered both Winfield ( who missed the entire 1989 season ) and Mattingly ( who missed almost the entire second half of 1990 ) . Winfields tenure with the team ended when he was dealt to the California Angels . From 1989 to 1992 , the team had a losing record , spending significant money on free-agents and draft picks who did not live up to expectations . In 1990 , the Yankees had the worst record in the American League , and their fourth last-place finish in franchise history .",
      "During the 1990 season , Yankee fans started to chant 1918 ! to taunt the Red Sox , reminding them of the last time they won a World Series one weekend the Red Sox were there in 1990 . Each time the Red Sox were at Yankee Stadium afterward , chants of 1918 ! echoed through the stadium . Yankee fans also taunted the Red Sox with signs saying CURSE OF THE BAMBINO , pictures of Babe Ruth , and wearing 1918 ! T-shirts each time they were at the stadium .",
      "The poor showings in the 1980s and early 1990s soon changed . Steinbrenner hired Howard Spira to uncover damaging information on Winfield and was subsequently suspended from day-to-day team operations by Commissioner Fay Vincent when the plot was revealed . This turn of events allowed management to implement a coherent acquisition/development program without owner interference . General Manager Gene Michael , along with manager Buck Showalter , shifted the clubs emphasis from high-priced acquisitions to developing talent through the farm system . This new philosophy developed key players such as outfielder Bernie Williams , shortstop Derek Jeter , catcher Jorge Posada , and pitchers Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera . The first significant success came in 1994 , when the Yankees had the best record in the AL , but the season was cut short by a players strike . Because the Yankees were last in a postseason in a season cut short by a strike , the news media constantly reminded the Yankees about the parallels between these two Yankees teams , which included both teams having division leads taken away by strike . Throughout October , the media continued to speculate about what might have been if there had not been a strike , making references to the days games in the postseason would have been played .",
      "A year later , the team qualified for the playoffs in the new wild card slot in the strike-shortened 1995 season . In the memorable 1995 American League Division Series against the Seattle Mariners , the Yankees won the first two games at home and lost the next three in Seattle . Although Mattingly batted .417 with a home run and six RBI in the only postseason series of his career , his back problems led him to retire after the 1995 season .",

      "Joe Torre had a mediocre run as a manager in the National League , and the choice was initially derided ( Clueless Joe was a headline in the New York Daily News ) . However , his calm demeanor proved to be a good fit , and his tenure was the longest under George Steinbrenners ownership .",
      "The 1996 season saw the rise of three Yankees who formed the core of the team for years to come : rookie shortstop Derek Jeter , second-year starting pitcher Andy Pettitte , and second-year pitcher Mariano Rivera , who served as setup man in 1996 before becoming closer in 1997 . Aided by these young players , the Yankees won their first AL East title in 15 years . They defeated the Texas Rangers in the ALDS , and in ALCS beat the Baltimore Orioles 4\u20131 , which included a notable fan interference by Jeffrey Maier that was called as a home run for the Yankees . In the World Series the team rebounded from an 0\u20132 series deficit and defeated the defending champion Atlanta Braves , ending an 18-year championship drought . Jeter was named Rookie of the Year . In 1997 , the Yankees lost the 1997 ALDS to the Cleveland Indians 3\u20132 . General manager Bob Watson stepped down and was replaced by assistant general manager Brian Cashman .",

The Yankees are the last MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and after the 2000 season they joined the Yankees teams of 1936\u201339 and 1949\u201353 , as well as the 1972\u201374 Oakland Athletics as the only teams to win at least three consecutive World Series .",
      "In aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , the Yankees defeated the Oakland Athletics in the ALDS , and the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS .

At the beginning of the 2009 season , the Yankees opened the new Yankee Stadium , located just a block north on River Avenue from their former home . The Yankees set a major league record by playing error-free ball for 18 consecutive games from May 14 to June 1 , 2009 . The Yankees finished first in the AL East . In the ALDS they swept the Minnesota Twins before defeating the Los Angeles Angels in the ALCS , 4\u20132 . They Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies , in the World Series 4\u20132 , their 27th World Series title .",
      "The 2010 season featured the rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox being revived to start and end the season . The Yankees and the Red Sox started and finished the season against each other at Fenway Park . This was the first time since 1950 this had happened . In June , Joe Torres Dodgers played games against the Yankees for the first time since he became manager of the Dodgers , with the Yankees taking two out of three games in the series . During the 2010 All-Star break , public address announcer Bob Sheppard and principal owner George Steinbrenner died . Eight days later , another longtime Yankee icon , former player and manager Ralph Houk , died . The Yankees won the American League Wild Card . They swept the Minnesota Twins in the 2010 American League Division Series , but lost to the Texas Rangers in the ALCS , 4\u20132 .",
      "In a 22\u20139 win over the Oakland Athletics on August 25 , 2011 , the Yankees became the first team in Major League history to hit three grand slams in a single game . They were hit by Robinson Can\u00f3 , Russell Martin , and Curtis Granderson . The Yankees won the AL East title , finishing with 97 wins and took home field throughout the AL postseason . However , they were defeated by the Tigers , 3\u20132 , in the ALDS .",
      "In 2012 , the Yankees again finished the season with the ALs best record at 95\u201367 . In mid-July , the Yankees traded two prospects to the Seattle Mariners for Ichiro Suzuki . They faced the Orioles in the ALDS . In Game 3 , Ra\u00fal Iba\u00f1ez became the oldest player to hit two home runs in a game , the oldest to hit a walk-off home run , the first substitute position player in a postseason game to hit two home runs , and the first to hit two home runs in the 9th inning or later in a postseason game , in the Yankees 3\u20132 win . The Yankees defeated the Orioles in five games . However , in the ALCS , the Yankees lost to the Tigers again , this time in a four-game sweep , which was compounded with a struggling offense and a season-ending injury to Derek Jeter .",
      "The 2013 season was riddled with injuries . Mark Teixeira strained his elbow during the World Baseball Classic prior to the start of the season and played only 15 games for the Yankees . Alex Rodriguez played only 44 games after a hip surgery , Jeter played only 17 games due to his ankle injury from the 2012 ALCS , and Curtis Granderson played only 61 games due to forearm and knuckle injuries . On April 12 , 2013 , the Yankees made their second triple play ever . It was scored as 4\u20136\u20135\u20136\u20135\u20133\u20134 , the first triple play of its kind in baseball history . On September 25 , the Yankees lost to the Tampa Bay Rays , which for the second time in the wild-card era , eliminated them from playoff contention . They ended the season 85\u201377 , finishing in 3rd place in the AL East .",
      "During the 2013\u201314 off-season , the Yankees signed Brian McCann , Jacoby Ellsbury , Masahiro Tanaka , and Carlos Beltr\u00e1n . Despite that , the Yankees missed the playoffs , finishing 2nd in the AL East with an 84\u201378 record . Rodriguez missed the entire season due to a 162-game suspension for his participation in the Biogenesis baseball scandal . One notable moment happened on September 25 , 2014 , when Jeter \u2013 playing his final home game \u2013 hit a walk-off single off pitcher Evan Meek to defeat the Baltimore Orioles in front of 48,613 fans who came to see the captain for the last time . Reliever Dellin Betances finished 3rd in voting for AL Rookie of the Year , while starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka finished 5th .",
      "The Yankees would return to the playoffs in 2015 . In his return from suspension , Rodriguez hit 33 home runs , his most since 2008 , and tied Hank Aarons record of fifteen 30-home-run seasons . Teixeira hit 31 home runs before a hit-by-pitch ended his season in August . Rookie first baseman Greg Bird had an impressive showing in Teixeiras place , hitting 11 home runs in 46 games , while rookie starting pitcher Luis Severino went 5\u20133 with a 2.89 ERA in innings after getting called up in August . Closer Andrew Miller won the AL Reliever of the Year Award . The Yankees led the AL East for most of the year before being felled by a surging Toronto Blue Jays team , ending the season 87\u201375 and in 2nd place . They were defeated by the Houston Astros in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game .",
      "In the off-season , the Yankees traded for Cincinnati Reds closer Aroldis Chapman after a domestic violence allegation lowered his value . Chapman was later suspended 30 games . The Yankees started the 2016 season with a record of 9\u201317 . The resurgent 2015 experienced by Rodriguez and Teixeira did not carry over , as they batted .200 and .204 for the season , respectively . Bird was ruled out for the season after undergoing shoulder surgery . Starting pitcher Michael Pineda struggled , going 6\u201312 with a 4.82 ERA , the 7th-highest in baseball . At the trade deadline , the Yankees stood at an uninspiring 52\u201352 , and traded Chapman and Miller .",
      "2017\u2013present : Baby Bombers .",
      "On July 25 , 2016 , the Yankees traded Aroldis Chapman to the Chicago Cubs for a group of players that included top shortstop prospect Gleyber Torres , and traded Andrew Miller to the Cleveland Indians for prospects outfielder Clint Frazier and pitcher Justus Sheffield . In addition , the Yankees traded 39-year-old designated hitter Carlos Beltran to the Texas Rangers for minor league prospects . The Yankees decision to be sellers , rather than buyers , at the trade deadline was unusual , given the Yankees typical win-now approach . In discussing the midseason trades , Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said that the Yankees recognized the need to look toward the future .",
      "In early August , both Teixeira and Rodriguez revealed their plans to retire by the seasons end . Rodriguez played his final game on August 12 , 2016 . In his fourth-to-last game , Teixeira hit a walk-off grand slam against the Boston Red Sox , his 409th and last career home run . The Yankees called up Tyler Austin and outfielder Aaron Judge in August . They made their debuts on August 13 , hitting back-to-back home runs in their first career at-bats . Catcher Gary S\u00e1nchez hit 20 home runs in 53 games , finishing 2nd in AL Rookie of the Year voting and setting the record at the time as the fastest to reach 20 career home runs . Sanchez , Judge and Austin , as well as the Yankees prosperous farm system in general , became nicknamed the Baby Bombers .",
      "After having traded Chapman to the Cubs during the 2016 season , the Yankees signed him as a free agent during the 2016\u201317 off-season ; Chapman agreed to a five-year , $86 million contract , the most lucrative in history for a relief pitcher . In 2017 , the Yankees finished the season with a record of 91\u201371 . They finished second in the AL East behind the Boston Red Sox , but captured the first AL Wild Card spot . Judge and S\u00e1nchez combined for 85 home runs . Sanchez finished with 33 , the most by a Yankees catcher in a single season . Judge led the American League with 52 home runs , breaking Mark McGwires major league record for most home runs by a rookie in a single season ( McGwire hit 49 in 1987 ) . The Yankees starting pitching was led by ace Luis Severino , who rebounded from his last season to lead the Yankees pitching staff . On July 1 , Clint Frazier made his MLB debut where he went 2 for 4 with a home run . The Yankees sent Dellin Betances , Starlin Castro , S\u00e1nchez , Severino , and Judge to the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game . Judge won the 2017 Home Run Derby , making the Yankees the team with the most players in history to win a Home Run Derby .",
      "After the 2017 All-Star break , the Yankees made a series of moves to acquire third baseman Todd Frazier , former Yankees reliever David Robertson , reliever Tommy Kahnle , starter Sonny Gray , and starter Jaime Garcia . In the 2017 AL Wild Card Game the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins to move on the ALDS . In the ALDS , the Yankees lost the first two games to the Cleveland Indians before winning the final three games and taking the series . They played the Houston Astros in the 2017 American League Championship Series and lost the series in seven games .",
      "In the 2017\u201318 off-season , the Yankees hired Aaron Boone to succeed Girardi as their new manager . The Yankees traded Starlin Castro and prospects Jorge Guzman and Jose Devers to the Miami Marlins for reigning National League Most Valuable Player Giancarlo Stanton . A right fielder who bats right-handed , Stanton hit 59 home runs and drove in 132 runs\u2014both major league highs\u2014in 2017 ; his contract was the largest player contract in the history of professional sports in North America at the time . The Yankees also traded third baseman Chase Headley and pitcher Bryan Mitchell to the San Diego Padres for outfielder Jabari Blash ; following the move , Yankees GM Brian Cashman stated that the trade create [ d ] payroll flexibility . On September 29 , 2018 Gleyber Torres hit the Yankees 265th home run of the season which broke the record of the most home runs in a season , previously held by the 1997 Seattle Mariners . The Yankees ended the 2018 season with 267 home runs as well as a record of 100\u201362 . In the 2018 playoffs , the Yankees defeated the Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card game , advancing to face the 108-win Red Sox in the ALDS . The Yankees fell to the Red Sox in the ALDS 3\u20131 . In Game 3 , the Yankees suffered their worst playoff defeat in team history , by a score of 16\u20131 .",
      "On June 25 , 2019 , the Yankees broke the record for the most home runs in consecutive games against the Toronto Blue Jays . On September 27 , the Yankees became the second team to reach 300 homers in a season , achieved by their ALDS opponent , the Minnesota Twins , a day earlier . The Yankees ended the 2019 season with a record of 103\u201359 , winning the AL East division title for the first time since 2012 .",
      "During the 2019 offseason , on December 18 , 2019 , the Yankees signed Gerrit Cole to a nine-year , $324 million contract .",
      "On August 28 , 2020 , the Yankees gave up a walk-off home run to Amed Rosario of the Mets in Yankee Stadium . The Mets were the home team because they were making up for a previously cancelled game . It was the first time a visiting player had hit a walk-off home run since Ed McKean hit one for the St . Louis Perfectos against the Cleveland Spiders in 1899 . The Yankees finished the shortened 2020 season with a record of 33\u201327 , finishing second in AL East . In the first round of the playoffs they swept the Cleveland Indians beating them in 2 games in the wild card series . In the ALDS , however , the Yankees were defeated by the Tampa Bay Rays in five games , marking four consecutive playoff exits .",
      "Distinctions .",
      "The Yankees have won a record 27 World Series in 40 appearances ( which , since the first World Series in 1903 , currently amounts to an average appearance every 2.7 seasons and a championship every 4.0 seasons ) ; the St . Louis Cardinals are in second place with 11 World Series championships . The Yankees number of World Series losses , 13 , is also an MLB record . The Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers are second in total World Series appearances with 20 . The Yankees have faced the Dodgers 11 times , going 8\u20133 . Among North American major sports , the Yankees success is approached only by the 24 Stanley Cup championships of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League . The Yankees have played in the World Series against every National League pennant winner except the Houston Astros and the Colorado Rockies .",
      "Through 2018 , the Yankees have an all-time regular season winning percentage of .569 ( a 10,275 \u2013 7,781 record ) , the best of any team in MLB history .",
      "On June 25 , 2019 , they set a new major league record for homering in 28 consecutive games , breaking the record set by the 2002 Texas Rangers .",
      "With the walk-off solo home run by DJ LeMahieu to win the game against the Oakland Athletics on August 31 , 2019 , the Yankees ended the month of August that year now holding a new record of 74 home runs hit in the month alone , a new record for the most home runs hit in a month by a single MLB team .",
      "World Series championships .",
      "The Yankees have won a record 27 World Series Championships . Their most recent one came when the new stadium opened in 2009 ; they defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games under manager Joe Girardi .",
      "Team nicknames .",
      "The Yankees name is often shortened to the Yanks . Their most prominently used nickname is the Bronx Bombers or simply the Bombers , a reference to their home and their prolific hitting . A less used nickname is the Pinstripes , in reference to the iconic feature on their home uniforms . Critics often refer to the team and the organization as the Evil Empire , a term applied to the Yankees by Boston Red Sox president Larry Lucchino in a 2002 interview with the New York Times . A term from the teams tumultuous late 1970s , the Bronx Zoo , is sometimes used by detractors , as well as the Damn Yankees , after the musical of the same name . Ironically , even many Yankees supporters refer to their team as the Evil Empire as a badge of honor and in fact enjoy having their team play the villain .",
      "Popularity .",
      "Fan support .",
      "With their recurring success since the 1920s , the Yankees have since been one of the most popular teams in the world , with their fan base coming from much further than the New York metropolitan area . The Yankees typically bring an upsurge in attendance at all or most of their various road-trip venues , drawing crowds of their own fans , as well as home-town fans whose interest is heightened when the Yankees come to town .",
      "The first 1 million-fan season was in 1920 , when 1,289,422 fans attended Yankee games at the Polo Grounds . The first 2 million-fan season was in 1946 , when 2,265,512 fans attended the games at Yankee Stadium . The Yankees have beaten the league average for home attendance 83 out of the last 87 years ( only during 1990 , 1991 , 1992 and 1994 did they not accomplish this ) . In the past seven years , the Yankees have drawn over three million fans each year , with an American League record-setting 4,090,696 in 2005 , becoming only the third franchise in sports history to draw over four million in regular-season attendance in their own ballpark . The Yankees were the league leaders in road attendance each year from 2001 through 2006 .",
      "One famous fan was Freddy Schuman , popularly known as Freddy Sez . For over 50 years , he came to the Yankees home games with a baseball cap , a Yankees jersey ( which on the back bears his own name ) , and a cake pan with a shamrock painted on it , which was connected to a sign inscribed with words of encouragement for the home team . Schuman died on October 17 , 2010 , at the age of 85 .",
      "To avoid unwanted publicity , Yankees players use aliases when registering for hotels . The Village Voice published a list of aliases used by Yankees players , and the contents were republished on The Smoking Gun .",
      "The Bleacher Creatures .",
      "The Bleacher Creatures are a notorious group of season ticket holders who occupied Section 39 in the right-field bleachers at the old Yankee Stadium and occupy Section 203 in the new one . They are known for their strict allegiance to the Yankees and are often merciless to opposing fans who sit in the section and cheer for the road team . They enjoy taunting the opposing teams right fielder with a series of chanting and slandering . The creatures got their nickname from New York Daily News columnist Filip Flip Bondy , who spent the 2004 season sitting in the section for research on his book about the group , Bleeding Pinstripes : A Season with the Bleacher Creatures of Yankee Stadium , published in 2005 .",
      "The Judges Chambers at Yankee Stadium .",
      "In 2017 , team management ordered the creation of a special cheer section within Section 104 for fans of Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge , called the Judges Chambers . They were the second AL team to create a special cheering section , following the Seattle Mariners . The Judges Chambers was added in response to his rise as one of the leagues most popular young stars . The sections 18 seats are given to lucky ticketholders and their families , along with black judicial robes with the team logo on the front and Judges 99 jersey number on the back ; prior to the addition of the section , fans were wearing white wigs and judicial robes to games in support of Judge . Occasionally , community organizations , charities and Little League teams are given precedence when selecting participants . The seats , which are close to his position in right field , are surrounded by mahogany wood to emulate the appearance of the citys courthouses .",
      "Global expansion and business model .",
      "The Yankees baseball club is formally owned by Yankee Global Enterprises , which owns the teams regional YES sports network . The club has claimed that it is operating under annual losses in excess of $47 million , but this figure is attributed only to the ballclubs finances and not to finances attributed to YES or Yankees Global Enterprises .",
      "The Yankees have become well known for a winning reputation on a global level . In 2007 , they reached an agreement with the Chinese Baseball Association to allow coaches , scouts and trainers to work in China to promote baseball and judge talent . They are trying to do the same with the Yomiuri Giants and the Hanshin Tigers in Japan . The Yankees and Yomiuri Giants currently have a close relationship and share ideas and strategies . The Yomiuri Shimbun daily newspaper has an ad on the left-field wall at Yankee Stadium , and other Japanese ads appear on the scrolling backstop advertising board . The Yankees are hoping that close ties with countries such as China and Japan will give them personal , in-depth judgments of baseball talent .",
      "In 2008 , the Yankees announced a joint venture with the Dallas Cowboys to form the basis for a partnership in running food and beverage , and other catering services to both teams stadiums .",
      "In 2013 , Forbes magazine ranked New York Yankees as the fourth most valuable sports team in the world , behind Real Madrid of La Liga , Manchester United of the Premier League and Barcelona of La Liga , a value of $2.3 billion .",
      "In 2017 , Forbes magazine ranked the Yankees as the most valuable MLB team at $3.7 billion , up 9% from 2016 , with the average MLB team worth $1.54 billion .",
      "In 2019 , Forbes magazine ranked the Yankees as the most valuable MLB team at $4.6 billion , up 15% from 2018 , which is currently the 2nd most valuable sports franchise only behind the Dallas Cowboys .",
      "Criticism .",
      "With the long-term success of the franchise and a large Yankee fanbase , many fans of other teams have come to dislike the Yankees . The organization is sometimes referred to by detractors as the Bronx Zoo ( echoing the title of Sparky Lyles book ) or the Evil Empire . When the Yankees are on the road , it is common for the home fans to chant Yankees Suck , and T-shirts , bumper stickers and other items have been sold with this phrase .",
      "Much of the animosity toward the team may derive from its high payroll ( which was around $200 million at the start of the 2008 season , the highest of any American sports team ) . Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko noted , Hating the Yankees is as American as pizza pie , unwed mothers , and cheating on your income tax .",
      "Fight and theme songs .",
      "The official fight song for the Yankees is Here Come the Yankees , written in 1967 by Bob Bundin and Lou Stallman . While it is not used as often , it is still heard frequently in instrumental form , most prominently in radio broadcasts , until 1990 it was played as the theme for television broadcasts in several versions . Another song strongly linked to the team is New York , New York , which is played in the stadium after home games . The Frank Sinatra cover version is traditionally played after victories , and the Liza Minnelli original version after losses . However , due to a complaint from Minnelli , regardless of the result of the game played in the stadium it is the Sinatra version that is played to close it out . When the Yankees take the field before the start of every game , 2 Unlimiteds Get Ready For This is played , with the fans usually clapping along . When the Yankees score a run at home , a short snippet of 2 Unlimiteds Workaholic containing the bell chime of Westminster Quarters is played ( whenever Aaron Judge scores a run the snippet is replaced by with The Clang tone by veteran composer Mike Post , used in the Law & Order franchise ) .",
      "A wide selection of songs are played regularly at the stadium , many of them live on the Stadiums Hammond organ . God Bless America has been played during the 7th inning stretch since September 11 . The version typically played for many years since 2001 was an abbreviated version of Kate Smiths rendition . However , during many important games ( including most play-off games ) and on noteworthy days , it is sung live a cappella and includes a longer introduction , in 2019 the tradition of playing her version officially ended due to racial controversy involving Smith and the tune is now played live by the stadium organist during the stretch . During the 5th inning , the grounds crew , while performing their duties , dance to Y.M.C.A. . Cotton-Eyed Joe , once played during the 7th inning stretch , is now played in the 8th inning . On the DiamondVision screen , a man in farmers garb is shown dancing in the stadiums control room , with the words Cotton-Eyed Joey at the bottom . The organist will sometimes play the Zorba the Greek Theme , accompanied by clapping from the audience , to excite the crowd and encourage a rally .",
      "Radio and television .",
      "The Yankees Entertainment and Sports ( YES ) Network was launched in 2002 and serves as the primary home of the New York Yankees . Michael Kay is the play-by-play announcer with Ken Singleton , David Cone , Al Leiter , John Flaherty , and Paul ONeill working as commentators as part of a three-man , or occasionally two-man , booth . Bob Lorenz hosts the pre-game show and the post-game show with Jack Curry , and Meredith Marakovits and Nancy Newman are the on-site reporters . Some games are telecast on WPIX and formerly on WWOR-TV ; those broadcasts are produced by YES .",
      "Radio broadcasts are on the Yankees Radio Network , the flagship station being WFAN 660 AM , with John Sterling as the play-by-play announcer and Suzyn Waldman providing the commentary , with Spanish-language broadcasts on WADO 1280 AM .",

      "- Frank Messer , Phil Rizzuto and Bill White teamed together in the 1970s and 1980s . Rizzuto , with 40 years in the broadcast booth , was the longest-serving broadcaster in the history of the club . Messer and White each worked nearly two decades for the Yankees , with White notably moving on to become president of the National League in 1989 . Bobby Murcer also called games for over twenty years , and continued with the YES Network until shortly before his death from brain cancer .",
      "Roster .",
      "Retired numbers .",
      "The Yankees have retired 21 numbers for 23 individuals , the most in Major League Baseball .",
      "The retired numbers were displayed behind the old Yankee Stadiums left-field fence and in front of the opposing teams bullpen , forming a little alley that connects Monument Park to the left-field stands . When the franchise moved across the street to the new stadium , the numbers were incorporated into Monument Park that sits place in center field between both bullpens . The 21 numbers are placed on the wall in chronological order , beginning with Lou Gehrigs number 4 . This was retired soon after Gehrig left baseball on July 4 , 1939 , the same day he gave his famous farewell speech . His was the first number retired in Major League Baseball history . Beneath the numbers are plaques with the names of the players and a descriptive paragraph .",
      "The number 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball in honor of Jackie Robinson on April 15 , 1997 , the 50th anniversary of his breaking the color barrier . The day was declared Jackie Robinson Day , and was later observed by all of baseball , with select players from every team wearing the number 42 . Players who wore No . 42 at the time were allowed to continue to wear it until they left the team with which they played on April 15 , 1997 ; Mariano Rivera was the last active player covered under that grandfather clause . While other teams placed the number 42 with the rest of their retired numbers , the Yankees did not do so at first . Ten years later , on April 17 , 2007 , the Yankees honored Robinson by mounting the logo of Jackie Robinson Day with a corresponding plaque alongside the rest of the retired numbers . Because the Yankees were finishing a roadtrip in Oakland on Jackie Robinson Day , the ceremony took place two days later . When the Yankees moved to the second Yankee Stadium , they replaced the Jackie Robinson Day logo with a number 42 that resembled the other retired numbers . Later on they replaced the number 42 so that it resembled the Dodgers style , and on September 22 , 2013 , a plaque was dedicated to Robinson in Monument Park . Also , the number 42 dedicated to Robinson was removed entirely and replaced with one for Mariano Rivera .",
      "In 1972 , the number 8 was retired for two players on the same day , in honor of catcher Bill Dickey and his protege , catcher Yogi Berra . Berra inherited Dickeys number in 1948 after Dickey ended his playing career and became a coach .",
      "Billy Martin is the only Yankee to have his number retired as a player/manager combination . He wore number 1 as a player in the 1950s and as a manager in the 1970s and 1980s .",
      "The numbers 37 and 6 , retired for Casey Stengel and Joe Torre respectively , are the only numbers retired by the Yankees for someone who served solely as manager of the team . Stengel managed the Yankees to ten pennants and seven world championships between 1949 and 1960 , including a record five consecutive world championships from 1949 through 1953 . Joe Torre managed the Yankees from 1996 to 2007 , winning six pennants and four World Series championships .",
      "On May 14 , 2017 , the Yankees retired number 2 in honor of Derek Jeter . This leaves 0 , which the Yankees have previously never issued , as the only single-digit number available for future Yankees . In 2019 the team signed Adam Ottavino and issued him the number 0 , which he previously wore as a member of the Colorado Rockies .",
      "At least two Yankees numbers have not been formally retired , but have been kept out of circulation . The New York Yankees have not re-issued Paul ONeills #21 since he ended his career at the end of 2001 , except for a brief period of a few days in 2008 when Morgan Ensberg and then LaTroy Hawkins wore #21 , before fan complaints led Hawkins to change his number to #22 in April . Additionally , the Yankees have held Alex Rodriguezs #13 out of circulation since his retirement in 2016 .",
      "Rivalries .",
      "Boston Red Sox .",
      "The Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry is one of the oldest , most famous , and fiercest rivalries in professional sports . For over 100 years , the Yankees and Boston Red Sox Yankees have been intense rivals . The rivalry is often termed the best and greatest rivalry in all of sports . Games between the two teams are often broadcast on national television .",
      "The rivalry is sometimes so polarizing that it is often a heated subject , like religion or politics , in the Northeastern United States . Since the inception of the wild card team and an added Division Series , the rivals have met in the playoffs four times ( with the Yankees winning the 1999 and 2003 American League Championship Series and the Red Sox winning in 2004 American League Championship Series and the 2018 American League Division Series ) In addition , the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title , in 1904 ( when the Red Sox won ) and 1949 ( when the Yankees won ) .",
      "The teams also finished tied for first in 1978 , when the Yankees won a high-profile tiebreaker game for the division title . The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season . Similarly , the 2004 ALCS is notable for the Yankees leading 3 games to 0 and ultimately losing the next four games and the series . The Red Sox comeback was the only time in MLB history that a team has come back from a 0\u20133 deficit to win a postseason series .",
      "Subway Series .",
      "The Subway Series is a series of games played between teams based in New York City . The terms historic usage has been in reference to World Series games played between New York teams . The Yankees have appeared in all Subway Series games as they have been the only American League team in the city , and have compiled an 11\u20133 record in the 14 championship Subway Series . Since 1997 , the term Subway Series has also been applied to interleague play during the regular season between the Yankees and National League New York Mets .",

      "1st Royal Bavarian Division",
      "The 1st Royal Bavarian Division was a unit of the Royal Bavarian Army that served alongside the Prussian Army as part of the Imperial German Army . The division was formed on November 27 , 1815 , as the Infantry Division of the Munich General Command ( Infanterie-Division des Generalkommandos M\u00fcnchen. ) . It was called the 1st Army Division between 1822 and 1848 , again between 1851 and 1859 , and again from 1869 to 1872 . It was called the 1st Infantry Division from 1848 to 1851 ( as well as during wartime ) and was named the Munich General Command from 1859 to 1869 . From April 1 , 1872 , until mobilization for World War I , it was the 1st Division . Within Bavaria , it was not generally referred to as a Royal Bavarian division , but outside Bavaria , this designation was used for it , and other Bavarian units , to distinguish them from similarly numbered Prussian units . The division was headquartered in Munich from 1815 to 1919 . The division was part of the 1st Royal Bavarian Army Corps .",
      "The division fought against Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 . In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 , the division fought alongside the Prussians . It saw action in battles of W\u00f6rth , Beaumont , and Sedan , the 1st and 2nd battles of Orleans , the battle of Loigny-Poupry , and the siege of Paris .",
      "During World War I , the division served on the Western Front . It fought in the Battle of the Frontiers against French forces in the early stages , and then participated in the Race to the Sea . Thereafter , it remained on the northern part of the front facing the British Army through 1915 and early 1916 . The Infantry Life Regiment was transferred from the division in 1915 to become part of a provisional German mountain division , the Alpenkorps , sent to the Italian Front . In 1916 , the division went into the Battle of Verdun . After Verdun , it went to the Somme in that battles later stages . 1917 was spent mainly occupying the trench lines . In 1918 , the division participated in the German spring offensive . The division was generally rated one of the better German divisions by Allied intelligence .",

      "John Franklin",
      "Sir John Franklin ( 16 April 1786 \u2013 11 June 1847 ) was a British Royal Navy officer and Arctic explorer . After serving in wars against Napoleonic France and the United States , he led two expeditions into the Canadian Arctic , in 1819 and 1825 , and served as Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemens Land from 1839 to 1843 . During his third and final expedition to force the Northwest Passage in 1845 , Franklins ships became icebound off King William Island in what is now Nunavut , where he died in June 1847 . The icebound ships were abandoned ten months later and the entire crew died , from causes such as starvation , hypothermia , and scurvy .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early life .",
      "Franklin was born in Spilsby , Lincolnshire , on , the ninth of twelve children born to Hannah Weekes and Willingham Franklin . His father was a merchant descended from a line of country gentlemen while his mother was the daughter of a farmer . One of his brothers later entered the legal profession and eventually became a judge in Madras ; another joined the East India Company ; while a sister , Sarah , was the mother of Emily Tennyson , wife of Alfred , Lord Tennyson . John Franklin must have been affected by an obvious desire to better his social and economic position , given that his elder brothers struggled , sometimes successfully and sometimes not , to establish themselves in a wide variety of careers .",
      "Educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Louth , he soon became interested in a career at sea . His father , who intended for Franklin to enter the church or become a businessman , was initially opposed but was reluctantly convinced to allow him to go on a trial voyage on a merchant ship when he was aged 12 . His experience of seafaring only confirmed his interest in a career at sea , so in March 1800 , Franklins father secured him a Royal Navy appointment on .",
      "Commanded by Captain Lawford , the Polyphemus carried 64 guns and , at the time of Franklins appointment , was still at sea . He did not join the vessel until the autumn of 1800 . Initially serving as a first class volunteer , Franklin soon saw action in the Battle of Copenhagen in which the Polyphemus participated as part of Horatio Nelsons squadron . An expedition to the coast of Australia aboard , commanded by Captain Matthew Flinders , followed , with Franklin now a midshipman . He accompanied Captain Nathaniel Dance on the , frightening off Admiral Charles de Durand-Linois at the Battle of Pulo Aura in the South China Sea on . He was present at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 aboard . During the War of 1812 against the United States , Franklin , now a lieutenant , served aboard and was wounded during the Battle of Lake Borgne in December 1814 , just prior to the decisive U.S . victory at the Battle of New Orleans one month later .",
      "Franklin commanded in 1818 on a journey from London to Spitzbergen , now Svalbard . The overall expedition was commanded by Captain David Buchan on HMS Dorothea .",
      "1819 : Coppermine expedition .",
      "In 1819 , Franklin was chosen to lead the Coppermine expedition overland from Hudson Bay to chart the north coast of Canada eastwards from the mouth of the Coppermine River . On his 1819 expedition , Franklin fell into the Hayes River at Robinson Falls and was rescued by a member of his expedition about downstream .",
      "Between 1819 and 1822 , he lost 11 of the 20 men in his party . Most died of starvation or exhaustion , but there were also at least one murder and suggestions of cannibalism . The survivors were forced to eat lichen and even attempted to eat their own leather boots . This gained Franklin the nickname of the man who ate his boots .",
      "1823 : Marriage and third Arctic expedition .",
      "In 1823 , after returning to England , Franklin married the poet Eleanor Anne Porden . Their daughter , Eleanor Isabella , was born the following year . His wife died of tuberculosis in 1825 . Eleanor Isabella married Reverend John Philip Gell in 1849 . She died in 1860 .",
      "In 1825 , he left for his second Canadian and third Arctic expedition , the Mackenzie River expedition . The goal this time was the mouth of the Mackenzie River from which he would follow the coast westward and possibly meet Frederick William Beechey who would try to sail northeast from the Bering Strait . With him was John Richardson who would follow the coast east from the Mackenzie to the mouth of the Coppermine River .",
      "At the same time , William Edward Parry would try to sail west from the Atlantic . ( Beechey reached Point Barrow and Parry became frozen in east . At this time , the only known points on the north coast were a hundred or so miles east from the Bering Strait , the mouth of the Mackenzie , Franklins stretch east of the Coppermine , and a bit of the Gulf of Boothia which had been seen briefly from the land. ) Supplies were better organized this time , in part because they were managed by Peter Warren Dease of the Hudsons Bay Company ( HBC ) .",
      "After reaching Great Slave Lake using the standard HBC route , Franklin took a reconnaissance trip down the Mackenzie and on , became the second European to reach its mouth . He erected a flagpole with buried letters for Parry . He returned to winter at Fort Franklin ( modern-day D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 ) on Great Bear Lake . The following summer he went downriver and found the ocean frozen . He worked his way west for several hundred miles and gave up on at Return Reef when he was about east of Beecheys Point Barrow .",
      "Reaching safety at Fort Franklin on 21 September , he left on and spent the rest of the winter and spring at Fort Chipewyan . He reached Liverpool on the first of September 1827 . Richardsons eastward journey was more successful . Franklins diary from this expedition describes his men playing hockey on the ice of the Great Bear Lake ; D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 , built on the site of Fort Franklin , thus considers itself to be one of the birthplaces of the sport .",
      "On , he married Jane Griffin , a friend of his first wife and a seasoned traveller who proved indomitable in the course of their life together . On , he was knighted by George IV and the same year awarded the first Gold Medal of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie of France . On , he was made Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order and a Knight of the Greek Order of the Redeemer .",
      "1837 : Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemens Land .",
      "Franklin was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemens Land in 1837 , but was removed from office in 1843 . He is remembered by a significant landmark in the centre of Hobart\u2014a statue of him dominates the park known as Franklin Square , which was the site of the original Government House . On the plinth below the statue appears Tennysons epitaph :",
      "His wife worked to set up a university , which was eventually established in 1890 , and a museum , credited to the Royal Society of Tasmania in 1843 under the leadership of her husband . Lady Franklin may have worked to have the Lieutenant-Governors private botanical gardens , established in 1818 , managed as a public resource . Lady Franklin also established a glyptotheque and surrounding lands to support it near Hobart . Sir John and Lady Jane Franklin adopted the daughter of the chief of an indigenous Australian tribe . She was renamed Mathinna and was raised with their own daughter Eleanor , but she was abandoned in Tasmania when the Franklins returned to England in 1843 .",
      "The village of Franklin , on the Huon River , is named in his honour , as is the Franklin River on the West Coast of Tasmania , one of the better known Tasmanian rivers due to the Franklin Dam controversy .",
      "Shortly after leaving his post as Governor of Tasmania , Franklin revisited a cairn on Arthurs Seat , a small mountain just inside Port Phillip Bay in Victoria , Australia , that he had visited as a midshipman with Captain Matthew Flinders in April 1802 . On this trip he was accompanied by Captain Reid of The Briars and Andrew Murison McCrae of Arthurs Seat Station , now known as McCrae Homestead .",
      "1845 : Northwest Passage expedition .",
      "Exploration of the Arctic coastal mainland after Franklins second Arctic expedition had left less than of unexplored Arctic coastline . The British decided to send a well-equipped Arctic expedition to complete the charting of the Northwest Passage . After Sir James Clark Ross declined an offer to command the expedition , an invitation was extended to Franklin , who despite being 59 years old , accepted what was to become Franklins lost expedition .",
      "A younger man , Commander James Fitzjames , was given command of and Franklin was named the expedition commander . Captain Francis Crozier , who had commanded during the Ross expedition of 1841\u20131844 to the Antarctic , was appointed executive officer and commander of Terror . Franklin was given command on , and received official instructions on .",
      "Erebus and Terror were sturdily built and were outfitted with recent inventions . These included steam engines from the London and Greenwich Railway that enabled the ships to make on their own power , a unique combined steam-based heating and distillation system for the comfort of the crew and to provide large quantities of fresh water for the engines boilers , a mechanism that enabled the iron rudder and propeller to be drawn into iron wells to protect them from damage , ships libraries of more than 1,000 books , and three years worth of conventionally preserved or tinned preserved food supplies . The tinned preserved food was supplied from a cut-rate provisioner who was awarded the contract a few months before the ships were to sail .",
      "Though the provisioners patent process was sound , the haste with which he had prepared thousands of cans of food led to sloppily-applied beads of solder on the cans interior edges , allowing lead to leach into the food . Additionally , the water distillation system may have used lead piping and lead-soldered joints , which would have produced drinking water with a high lead content .",
      "The Franklin Expedition set sail from Greenhithe , England , on , with a crew of 24 officers and 110 men . The ships travelled north to Aberdeen and the Orkney Isles for supplies . From Scotland , the ships sailed to Greenland with and a transport ship , Barretto Junior . After misjudging the location of Whitefish Bay on Disko Island , the expedition backtracked and finally harboured in that far north outpost to prepare for the rest of their voyage . Five crew members were discharged and sent home on the Rattler and Barretto Junior , reducing the ships final crew size to 129 . The expedition was last seen by Europeans on , when Captain Dannett of the whaler encountered Terror and Erebus moored to an iceberg in Lancaster Sound .",
      "It is now believed that the expedition wintered on Beechey Island in 1845\u201346 . Terror and Erebus became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again . According to a note later found on that island , Franklin died there on , but the exact location of his grave is unknown .",
      "After two years and no word from the expedition , Lady Franklin urged the Admiralty to send a search party . Because the crew carried supplies for three years , the Admiralty waited another year before launching a search and offering a \u00a320,000 reward ( ) for finding the expedition . The money and Franklins fame led to many searches .",
      "At one point , ten British and two American ships , and , headed for the Arctic . Eventually , more ships and men were lost looking for Franklin than in the expedition itself . Ballads such as Lady Franklins Lament , commemorating Lady Franklins search for her lost husband , became popular .",
      "In the summer of 1850 , several expeditions , including three from England as well as one from the United States , joined in the search . They converged off the east coast of Beechey Island , where the first relics of the Franklin expedition were found , including the gravesites of three of Franklins crewmen . Many presumed Franklin was still alive , and he was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the Blue in October 1852 , an example of an unintentional posthumous promotion .",
      "In 1854 , the Scottish explorer John Rae , while surveying the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudsons Bay Company , discovered the true fate of the Franklin party from talking to Inuit hunters . He was told both ships had become icebound , and the men had tried to reach safety on foot but had succumbed to cold , and some had resorted to cannibalism .",
      "Raes report to the Admiralty was leaked to the press , which led to widespread revulsion in Victorian society , enraged Franklins widow , and condemned Rae to ignominy . Lady Franklins efforts to eulogise her husband , with support from the British Establishment , led to a further 25 searches over the next four decades , none of which would add much further information of note regarding Franklin and his men , but contributed hugely to the mapping of the Arctic .",
      "In the mid-1980s , Owen Beattie , a University of Alberta professor of anthropology , began a 10-year series of scientific studies that showed that the Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis . Toxicological reports indicated that lead poisoning was also a possible factor .",
      "In 1997 , more than 140 years after his report , Dr . Raes account was finally vindicated ; cut marks caused by blades were discovered on the bones of some of the crew found on King William Island , strongly suggested that conditions had become so dire that some crew members resorted to cannibalism . Evidence suggestive of breakage and boiling of bones , characteristic of efforts to extract marrow , was subsequently identified . It appeared from these studies that a combination of bad weather , years locked in ice , poisoned food , botulism , starvation , and disease including scurvy , had killed everyone in the Franklin party . In October 2009 , marine archaeologist Robert Grenier outlined recent discoveries of sheet metal and copper which have been recovered from 19th-century Inuit hunting sites . Grenier firmly believes these pieces of metal once belonged to the Terror and formed the protective plating of the ships hull .",
      "A quote from the British newspaper The Guardian states :",
      "Legacy .",
      "For years after the loss of the Franklin party , the media of the Victorian era portrayed Franklin as a hero who led his men in the quest for the Northwest Passage . A statue of Franklin in his home town bears the inscription : Discoverer of the North West Passage . Statues of Franklin outside the Athenaeum Club in London and in Tasmania bear similar inscriptions . There is also a memorial to him in the Chapel of St Michael at Westminster Abbey .",
      "Many geographic locales are named after Franklin , among them Franklin Island in Antarctica , Franklin Island in Greenland , Franklin Strait in northern Canada , Franklin , Quebec , Franklin Sound north of Tasmania , and the Franklin River and town of Franklin in Tasmania , as well as many streets and schools . The Australian oceanographic research vessel bears his name as well . The wintering site of Franklins second Canadian expedition , in Deline , Northwest Territories , was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996 . The explorer was also memorialized when one of Canadas Northwest Territories subdivisions was named the District of Franklin .",
      "In 2009 , a special service of Thanksgiving was held in the chapel at the Royal Naval College to accompany the rededication of the national monument to Sir John Franklin . It was a celebration of the contributions made by the United Kingdom in the charting of northern Canada , and honoured the loss of life in the pursuit of geographical discovery . The service also marked the 150th anniversary of Francis McClintocks voyage aboard the yacht Fox , and that expeditions return to London with news of the tragedy .",

The wrecks were found many miles south of their last known location off the northwest coast of King William Island ; archaeologists believe the Terror must have been crewed and sailed to its new location , as the anchor was used and it was sailed through a maze of islands and channels . The wrecks are designated as the Wrecks of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror National Historic Site , with the precise locations of the designations in abeyance .",

      "Black Tiger ( professional wrestling )",
      "Origins .",
      "According to the storyline set forth by the original anime , Black Tiger is a wrestler trained and sent by a Yakuza-like organisation called the Tigers Cave . The Tigers Cave desire vengeance upon the wrestler Tiger Mask , a former trainee of theirs , for publicly turning his back on them and no longer paying them monetary tributes . With the animes protagonist translated by Antonio Inoki to actual NJPW wrestling events ( in the form of Satoru Sayama ) it was perhaps inevitable that his arch-enemy would also appear in the promotion .",
      "The wrestlers portraying Black Tiger have traditionally been gaijin , somewhat of a throwback to the days in which non-Japanese were portrayed as heels to fight against national heroes such as Rikid\u014dzan to promote national pride after World War II , paralleling the way American promotions would often portray wrestlers depicted as , or indeed actually being from , foreign countries as villains pitted against American-born heroes . In other countries this has varied . Black Tiger IV was a member of Team Japan during the TNA 2006 World X-Cup Tournament and during his CMLL career Black Tiger III was overtly portrayed as being Japanese . Black Tiger V was the first time Black Tiger was played by a Japanese wrestler .",
      "Incarnations .",
      "Black Tiger I .",
      "Mark Rollerball Rocco , an established British wrestler , was the first to assume the persona in 1982 to oppose the original Tiger Mask , Satoru Sayama . His pinnacle of success was defeating Gran Hamada in a tournament final for the vacant WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship on May 6 , 1982 , and was defeated twenty days later by Tiger Mask for the belt . Sayama left NJPW in 1983 and the rights to Tiger Mask were purchased by All Japan Pro Wrestling the following year for the use of Mitsuharu Misawa . AJPW were not to create a Black Tiger counterpart . Rocco continued to portray Black Tiger in NJPW until 1990 .",
      "Black Tiger II .",
      "In August 1993 Black Tiger made a return , this time portrayed by Eddie Guerrero . His Tiger Mask rival at this time was Koji Kanemoto . Kanemoto unmasked in January 1994 , while Guerrero was a finalist in the 1994 Super Grade Junior Heavyweight Tag League with The Great Sasuke , came third in the 1994 and 1995 Best of the Super Juniors tournaments and was victorious in 1996 .",
      "Black Tiger III .",
      "Following the fall of WCW , alumnus C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Gonz\u00e1lez , better known as Mexican star Silver King began wrestling for NJPW through their working relationship with his home promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre . Tiger Mask IV would not sign with NJPW until early 2003 and the highlight of Black Tiger IIIs Japanese run would be a failed attempt at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship alongside his real-life brother Dr . Wagner , Jr . before he devoted himself full-time to his CMLL career . Gonz\u00e1lez continued to use the Black Tiger name in Mexican independent companies even after CMLL repackaged him as El Bronco following NJPW unveiling Black Tiger IV in 2005 . His final match under the persona came when he lost a Mask versus Mask match to L.A . Park on February 4 , 2006 . He briefly wrestled under the persona again in 2017 , teaming with Black Tiger VII to take on Dr Wagner Jr . and El Hijo de Dr . Wagner Jr. .",
      "Black Tiger IV .",
      "In 2005 Rocky Romero debuted as Black Tiger IV by NJPW and immediately thrust into a feud with Tiger Mask IV , facing him for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship on May 14 . He made his debut for Ring of Honor in America , making him the first Black Tiger to wrestle as Black Tiger in America since Mark Rocco . After winning the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship on August 25 he defeated Tiger Mask for his title on October 8 , defending them until losing both to Tiger Mask on February 19 , 2006 . Black Tiger would join Jyushin Thunder Ligers CTU faction and represent NJPW as a member of Team Japan in TNA Wrestlings World X-Cup . Black Tiger IV returned to New Japan in February 2009 , joining GBH and restarting his feud with Tiger Mask IV . On April 5 , 2009 , at Resolution 09 Tiger Mask IV defeated Black Tiger IV in a title vs . mask match . After the match Romero removed his mask and then raised the arm of Tiger Mask thus ending his run as Black Tiger .",
      "Black Tiger V .",
      "Black Tigers fifth Generation ( V ) arrived in NJPW at Tokyo Dome February 15 , 2009 , attacking Tiger Mask IV . For the next couple of months , the new Black Tiger disappeared and was replaced at shows by Black Tiger IV . On April 5 , 2009 , at Resolution 09 after Tiger Mask had defeated Black Tiger IV for the last time , he was once again attacked by the fifth Black Tiger , who gave him a Death Valley Driver and then unmasked him . On June 20 , 2009 , at Dominion 6.20 , Tiger Mask defeated Black Tiger V in a mask vs . mask match . After the match Black Tiger removed his mask revealing himself as Tatsuhito Takaiwa , breaking the Black Tiger tradition of foreigners under the mask . Takaiwa reprised his role as Black Tiger V in 2011 in Toryumon Mexico , where he lost the mask for the second time on May 14 , 2011 , to \u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n . Despite losing his mask twice , Takaiwa continues to make appearances as Black Tiger V .",
      "Black Tiger VI .",
      "Black Tigers sixth generation ( VI ) , Tomohiro Ishii , had the shortest run under the mask . In early 2011 , Ishii began feuding with Tiger Mask IV and , after losing his hair on January 23 , began wearing a Black Tiger mask , despite still going by his real name , which he then lost to Tiger Mask IV on February 20 at The New Beginning .",
      "Black Tiger VII .",
      "Black Tigers seventh Generation ( VII ) , referred to simply as Black Tiger , debuted during New Japans , which took place on April 14 and 15 , 2012 , and which he went on to win . Following Kazushige Nosawas May 23 arrest for smuggling cannabis , it was confirmed that he had been portraying Black Tiger . Two days later , New Japan officially pulled Tiger from the Best of the Super Juniors tournament . Nosawa has continued working as Black Tiger VII , most notably for All Japan Pro Wrestling .",

      "The 416th Flight Test Squadron is a United States Air Force squadron . It is assigned to the 412th Operations Group , Air Force Materiel Command , stationed at Edwards Air Force Base , California .",
      "During World War II , the 416th Bombardment Squadron was a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress squadron , assigned to the 99th Bombardment Group of Fifteenth Air Force . It earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its performance in combat .",
      "Mission .",
      "The 416th performs flight testing on General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft .",
      "History .",
      "World War II .",
      "The 416th was established in early 1942 as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress reconnaissance squadron but was redesignated as a heavy bomb squadron before activation in June . It trained under II Bomber Command in the Pacific Northwest , being deployed with B-17Es directly to the XII Bomber Command in North Africa shortly after the Operation Torch landings in March 1943 . In Algeria , the squadron engaged in combat operations in support of American ground forces in Algeria and Tunisia during the 1943 North African campaign .",
      "In June 1943 , the 416th helped force the capitulation of Pantelleria Island . It bombed in preparation for and in support of the invasions of Sicily and southern Italy in the summer and fall of 1943 . In October 1943 the 416th was reassigned to the new Mediterranean Theater of Operations Fifteenth Air Force . Until the German capitulation in May 1945 , the unit engaged in strategic bombardment of enemy targets in Italy , France , Germany , Czechoslovakia , Austria , Hungary , Romania , Bulgaria , Yugoslavia , and Greece , attacking oil refineries , marshaling yards , aircraft factories , and other strategic objectives .",
      "After V-E Day , it was assigned to Air Transport Command Green Project , which was the movement of troops from Italy to staging areas in French Morocco . B-17s were dearmed with flooring and seats for 25 passengers installed . Each crew consisted of pilot , copilot , navigator and flight engineer . The 416th carried passengers from Tortorella and later from Marcianise Airfields to Port Lyautey Airfield , French Morocco , where transports moved them across the Atlantic or to Dakar for movement via the South Atlantic Transport Route .",
      "The squadron was demobilized in Italy in late 1945 , and inactivated in November .",
      "Reserves .",
      "The unit was activated in the reserves in 1947 and possibly assigned some B-29 Superfortresses ; however , it was never fully equipped or manned , and was inactivated in 1949 due to budget restraints .",
      "F-16 flight testing .",
      "The squadron was reactivated for flight testing of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon in 1989 , after an inactivity of 43 years . The unit inherited the role of the 6516th TS that was also based at Edwards AFB . As the 6516th , the 416th was tasked with testing different weapon systems and specialized equipment on the F-16 in different production versions ( blocks ) .",
      "Weapons testing forms only a small part of the units task . Most weapons testing is conducted together with the Eglin AFB based testing squadrons . Some F-16s are painted in a regular gray USAF scheme for weapons testing , but other color schemes are used , such as white aircraft with red tails and ventral fins . These aircraft are often used as chase planes for other aircraft test programs .",
      "A variety of 416th F-16s are used to chase F-22s and F-35s . These aircraft are also relocated to other airbases all over the country , mostly going to Eglin AFB for testing assistance or to Fort Worth JRB for assistance to the Lockheed F-35 program .",
      "In the 1990s the 416th helped in the development of the MLU upgrade package for older ( mainly European NATO countries ) F-16A/B models . The USAF eventually didnt get involved in the production process but did provide test aircraft #80-584 for this purpose . It is still flying with the squadron to test further enhancement packages for both MLU Vipers as for the USAF CCIP program",
      "In the 1990s the 416th led the flight test effort in the development of the AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System . The performance of this interim solution was instrumental in the retirement of the F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft in the mid 1990s . The Air Force planned to replace the F-4G but the program was cancelled and the AN/ASQ-213 remains the primary F-16 SEAD mission sensor for the HARM missile more than 25 years later .",
      "The unit briefly gained the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle test mission ( 2004-2005 ) . The F-15 fleet was sent to Eglin Air Force Base when the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters arrived in 2006 .",
      "During early 2009 , the squadron deployed to Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada and participated in a Red Flag exercise . This was the first of this type of deployment for any Air Force Material Command unit . Red Flag 09-2 ran from 26 January to 6 February 2009 . The reason for the deployment was to perform operational testing for the latest operating system M5.1+ software which is specific for the F-16 . The squadron took five aircraft all equipped with this latest software and flew 54 sorties .",
      "Another deployment was organized for 23 January to 4 February 2012 , to test software for the 6.1+ operating system . The new software allows several improvements , such as ability to carry the Small Diameter Bomb . This will allow the F-16 to carry more weapons and deliver this munition from farther away . Although primary deployed to test , the 416th was also a participant with one pilot taking top Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses ( SEAD ) pilot .",

      "Willem Rebergen ( born 12 September 1985 ) , better known by his stage name Headhunterz , is a Dutch DJ and music producer . Rebergen is also a voice actor . He has done dubbing for several movies and TV series . He started his career in 2005 working on Hardstyle music .",
      "Headhunterz has performed at Qlimax , Defqon.1 , Q-Base , In Qontrol , Decibel , Hard Bass , Electric Daisy Carnival and Tomorrowland .",
      "Headhunterz released his work on Scantraxx through his own sub-label , Scantraxx Reloaded , but in 2013 he started his own record label , HARD with STYLE . He signed with the North American electronic dance record label Ultra Music in 2013 and left his own label in 2015 . Since June 2017 , he officially returned to the Hardstyle community at the closing ceremony of Defqon.1 Weekend Festival 2017 .",
      "In 2018 , Headhunterz and fellow DJ Wildstylez , developed a brand new Hardstyle label , called : Art of Creation .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early life & career .",
      "Willem Rebergen was born on 12 September 1985 in Veenendaal , Netherlands . From an early age Rebergen had an interest in music . Having struggled with bullying at school , Rebergen looked for a distraction to make himself happy and so joined a local kids choir . Here he had his first exposure to a professional studio , recording Christmas albums with the choir . This experience left Rebergen interested and inspired by the process of creating music from the other side of the studio . In 2003 , while working at a clothing store he was offered tickets to Qlimax from friends who could not attend . This was his first exposure to hardstyle music . This experience gave him the impetus to forge a music career and in his own words from then on he was devoted to hardstyle and from that point interested in how to make the music . I wanted to make that kind of music .",
      "He purchased some turntables and connected them to his mixer practicing his DJing , while simultaneously making music in FL Studio , a digital audio workstation . Rebergen began sending demos out to labels under the alias Nasty D-Tuners , a duo project he formed with close friend Bobby van Putten . In 2004 Nasty D-Tuners entered and won the Defqon.1 DJ contest , winning a spot on that years lineup .",
      "Rebergen and van Putten heard of a new hard dance music label Hardcontrol , that was opening in Veenendaal . In 2005 , a year and a half after their performance at Defqon 2004 , Nasty D-Tuners were signed to Hardcontrol Records having two successful releases , with their work being played by then major Hardstyle producers/DJs . Also in 2005 , Rebergen and van Putten began attending a DJ class at the Rock Academy in the Netherlands . Rebergen found his time at the academy frustrating , due to a lack of encouragement towards producing Hardstyle and negative responses to the genre as a whole . Alienated by his experience at the Academy , Rebergen continued to send out Nasty D-Tuners demos to respective labels , one eventually reaching Scantraxx founder , Dov Elkabas ( The Prophet ) . Seeing promise in the young duo , having heard of their performance at Defqon.1 , Nasty D-Tuners were signed to Scantraxx in late 2005 . Unable to keep the alias Nasty D-Tuners due to disagreements with the former label , the name Headhunterz was chosen . By the end of 2005 , Rebergen and van Putten had performed at major hardstyle events including Defqon.1 , Q-Base and The Prophets X-Qlusive , all of which increased their profile within the Hardstyle scene .",
      "2006-2007 : Scantraxx & the beginning of Headhunterz .",
      "The year 2006 saw the first Headhunterz release Aiming for Your Brain/ Left Some Answers , on Scantraxx Special . Their debut release was followed by The Sacrifice/D-Tuned , again on Scantraxx Special . The Sacrifice was the duos most successful hit to date , Rebergen since stating his fond memories of the positive reception that The Prophet gave him the first time he heard it . Problems soon began to emerge when Rebergen came to the conclusion that he would be unable to perform and record for Scantraxx while simultaneously completing his course at the Rock Academy . Rebergen told van Putten of his decision to leave the Academy and hoped he would join and commit himself to Headhunterz and Scantraxx . van Putten then made the difficult decision to leave Rebergen , Scantraxx and Headhunterz and continue with his musical studies at the Rock Academy . Rebergens first solo performance as Headhunterz was the 2006 edition of the Q-Dance event , Defqon.1 . Following the final release of van Putten credited Headhunterz work , Scantraxx gave Rebergen his own sub label Scantraxx Reloaded which he would administer . Headhunterz first release on Scantraxx Reloaded was the three track Vinyl EP Victim of My Rage released in late 2006 . The Prophet continued to nurture the young talent , inviting Headhunterz to perform alongside him at the popular annual Q-Dance event , Qlimax .",
      "The year 2007 proved to be a successful year for Headhunterz . He had his first collaborations with fellow Scantraxx artists The Prophet and Abject ( DJ Frontliner ) . Along with the collaborations Headhunterz also released several successful solo tracks such as Forever Az One and Rock Civilization . Headhunterz then performed at the 2007 editions of Q-Base and Qlimax . He then created his first major anthem for the 2007 edition of Qlimax , The Power of the Mind . Headhunterz then had his first solo performance at Qlimax and played alongside DJs who he admired , Technoboy and The Prophet .",
      "2008 : Headhunterz & Wildstylez Presents : Project One .",
      "In 2008 , Headhunterz had his first collaboration with fellow Scantraxx artist Wildstylez . Their First song Blame It On the Music / Project 1 released in March and proved a success . It also provided the impetus for the launch of a new project and debut album for the pair , Project One . Finishing in under three months , producing an average of one track a week , Headhunterz and Wildstylez completed their 13 track debut album , Headhunterz & Wildstylez Present : Project One . The album was planned to debut at In Qontrol in a special one-hour set , showcasing the album . This performance was cancelled when Headhunterz suffered appendicitis . The Album debuted at Defqon.1 2008 , and was officially released shortly after in both CD and Digital formats on 25 July with Dutch graphical designer , Ruud van Eijk providing the artwork . Project One was well received in the Hardstyle community with tracks such as Life Beyond Earth , The Art of Creation , The Story Unfolds , Best of Both Worlds and Fantasy or Reality all proving to be successes on the dance floor . The Album was a defining influence on the direction Hardstyle would take in the years to come , with its emphasis on synth based trance influenced melodies and heavy use of pitched kicks . A Project One Tour followed along with 6 full-length album samplers and 1 remix sampler , all released on Scantraxx Reloaded . Along with Project One , Headhunterz had three solo releases that included popular tracks Just Say My Name , Subsonic and Reloaded Part 2 all on Scantraxx Reloaded , along with a first collaboration with Italian Hardstyle DJ Tatanka , Call It Music .",

      "2009 saw Headhunterz release seven new singles/EPs . Amongst these releases was the 2009 Defqon.1 Anthem , Scrap Attack . This opportunity to create the anthem , saw Headhunterz close the Mainstage of Defqon.1 for the first time . Speaking about the moment , Headhunterz stated that he achieved one of his long-term goals within Hardstyle that night and felt complete happiness . Along with the anthem , 2009 was a notable year in regards to collaborations for Headhunterz . He again teamed up with Wildstylez and along with Noisecontrollers created the incredibly popular anthem Tonight . In the Q-Dance harder styles top 1000 poll held in late 2013 , Tonight was voted into second place . The Summer of Hardstyle , made with The Prophet , proved to be an instant hit at events . Gaining inspiration from older Hardstyle DJ , Zenith , the track was a break from recent Headhunterz work with its emphasis on Reverse bass and simple scratching sounds from vinyl . The Project One Tour reached its finale with a first time visit to Australia . The duo making multiple appearances at the final editions of Transmission , a popular music event that was held in Sydney and Brisbane .",
      "2010 reflected Headhunterz and Hardstyles growing popularity around the world , in his own words 2010 was a year where my international bookings overtook my national ones .",
      "At the beginning of 2010 , Headhunterz was offered the chance to host his own X-Qlusive . Held on 30 January at the Heineken Music Hall , Amsterdam , X-Qlusive:Headhunterz featured Wildstylez , The Prophet , Noisecontrollers and Brennan Heart joining Headhunterz on the main stage . Headhunterz described X-Qlusive as the highlight of 2010 as It was an amazing night - a milestone in my career and personal life . I could have never imagined getting so far . In the buildup to X-Qlusive , Headhunterz revealed he was planning the release of his first studio album , Studio Sessions . Released on 8 March , Studio Sessions was a 15 track album containing a mixture of new unreleased tracks , collaborations , edits of older Headhunterz tracks and remixes done by Headhunterz and others .

First released on 27 May 2011 through iTunes , SoundCloud and YouTube , the hour-long podcast was promoted with the tagline Bringing you the music that comes from within ! and was aimed at showcasing Headhunterzs favorite tracks of the month , from both established and up and coming producers . With many unheard and new tracks getting their first broadcast on HARDwithSTYLE , the podcast quickly become one of the most popular electronic music podcasts . Headhunterz again was ranked in DJ Mags yearly top 100 DJs list , coming in at 17th , the highest of any Hardstyle DJ and confirming his place as one of the most sought after Hardstyle DJs . 2011 had significantly less releases from Headhunterz compared to past years mainly due to a large amount of time and effort being put into what would become his 3rd studio album which was planned for a release in 2012 . Nevertheless , Headhunterz had his last solo release on Scantraxx Reloaded , with the EP From Within / The Message is Hardstyle . The Message Is Hardstyle had a mixed reception , many disliking the track due its soft kicks and perceived ironic lyrics given the nature of the song . The track Make it Loud ( Headhunterz Remix ) popular for its reverse bass intro , also finally gained a release on Blutonium Records . Headhunterz also had many notable performances in 2011 , performing at Decibel , The Qontinent , Defqon.1 , X-Qlusive : D-Block & S-te-Fan and Thrillogy . Headhunterz also had a major tour of the USA and Mexico visiting 18 cities along the way and also performed at the first Mysteryland to be held outside of the Netherlands , in Chile .",
      "2012-2015 : Sacrifice & Ultra Records .",
      "In 2012 Headhunterz released his second studio album Sacrifice on 15 March . The 10 track album was the culmination of work done in 2011 and Headhunterz donated all profits to Dance4Life , an international initiative that mobilises and unite young people ( 13\u201319 years old ) to push back the spread of HIV/AIDS . The album was a collection of new tracks , edits and collaborations . Amongst the track list were standouts , Dragonborn , a previous freely released track inspired by the game , featuring the popular FUS RO DAH sample . Doomed , a track that was produced in response to the significant criticism of his musical direction and track The Message is Hardstyle , feature lyrics that make light of the many haters that feature on an artists web blog . Other highlights were the early hardstyle inspired , Back In the Days , the 2012 Hardbass Anthem , Eternalize and a collaboration with Psyko Punkz , Disrespect .",
      "Along with Sacrifice , Headhunterz recorded and released a number of remixes for popular house artists stating , Doing remixes for other genres makes so much more sense than remixing stuff in your own genre...it gave me a whole different approach in producing hardstyle and I hope the same fans will benefit from that . He had his first song release on Ultra Music with one such remix , Lessons in Love by Kaskade . He remixed the Hardwell song , Spaceman which saw a release on Hardwells Revealed Recordings . Two remixes for German House producer , Zedd , Spectrum was released for free through Headhunterzs social media and Clarity ( Feat . Foxes ) was released on the Clarity Remixes EP released through Interscope Records . Lastly , he remixed Nicky Romeros popular 2011 track Toulouse .

      "Igor Grabar",
      "Igor Emmanuilovich Grabar ( , 25 March 1871 in Budapest \u2013 16 May 1960 in Moscow ) was a Russian post-impressionist painter , publisher , restorer and historian of art . Grabar , descendant of a wealthy Rusyn family , was trained as a painter by Ilya Repin in Saint Petersburg and by Anton A\u017ebe in Munich . He reached his peak in painting in 1903\u20131907 and was notable for a peculiar divisionist painting technique bordering on pointillism and his rendition of snow .",
      "By the end of 1890s , Grabar had established himself as an art critic . In 1902 , he joined Mir Iskusstva , although his relations with its leaders Sergei Diaghilev and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky were far from friendly . In 1910\u20131915 , Grabar edited and published his opus magnum , the History of Russian Art . The History employed the finest artists and critics of the period ; Grabar personally wrote the issues on architecture that set an unsurpassed standard of understanding and presenting the subject . Concurrently , he wrote and published a series of books on contemporary and historic Russian painters . In 1913 , he was appointed executive director of the Tretyakov Gallery and launched an ambitious reform program that continued until 1926 . Grabar diversified the Tretyakov collection into modern art and in 1917 published its first comprehensive catalogue . In 1921 Grabar became the first professor of Art restoration at the Moscow State University .",
      "An experienced politician , Grabar stayed at the top of the Soviet art establishment until his death , excluding a brief voluntary retirement in 1933\u20131937 . He managed art-restoration workshops ( present-day Grabar Centre ) during 1918\u20131930 and from 1944 to 1960 . Grabar took active part in redistribution of former church art nationalized by the Bolsheviks and established new museums for the confiscated treasures . In 1943 , he formulated the Soviet doctrine of compensating World War II losses with art looted in Germany . After the war , he personally advised Joseph Stalin on the preservation of architectural heritage .",
      "Biography .",
      "Family roots .",
      "Emmanuil Hrabar ( 1830\u20131910 ) , father of Igor Grabar and his older brothers Bela and Vladimir ( the future law scholar , 1865\u20131956 ) , was an ethnic Rusyn lawyer and a politician of pro-Russian orientation . He was elected to the Hungarian Parliament in 1869 , at the same time , maintaining ties with slavophiles in Moscow and the Russian Embassy . Olga Hrabar ( 1843\u20131930 ) , mother of Igor and Vladimir , was a daughter of Rusyn pro-Russian , anti-Catholic politician Adolph Dobryansky ( 1817\u20131901 ) . According to Igor Grabars memoirs , Dobryansky ran an underground network of obedient followers . Dobryansky and his group , unaware of the realities of living in the Russian Empire , leaned to its official doctrine of Orthodoxy , Autocracy , and Nationality ; Dobryansky , a man of wealth and pedigree , even imitated the lifestyle of a Russian landlord in minute details ; two of his sons joined Imperial Russian service . Dobryansky praised the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 by Russian troops , dreaded by his own Rusyn peasants .",
      "In the early 1870s , the Hungarian government forced Emmanuil Hrabar to leave the country . Olga with children stayed under police surveillance at the Dobryansky manor in \u010certi\u017en\u00e9 ( now in Slovakia ) . In 1880 , the Hrabars temporarily reunited in Russia . Emmanuil passed qualification test to teach German and French and settled with Igor and Vladimir in Yegoryevsk . Olga returned to Hungary to continue pro-Russian propaganda ; in 1882 she and her father were , at last , arrested for treason and brought to a trial that aroused public suspicion of a police provocation . She was acquitted for lack of evidence and emigrated to Russia for the rest of her life . In Russia , the Hrabars lived under nom de guerre Hrabrov ; Igor Grabar restored his real surname ( transliterated from Russian with a G , unlike his brother Vladimir Hrabar ) in the early 1890s .",
      "Education .",
      "Grabar ( then Hrabrov ) attended high school in Yegoryevsk , where his father taught foreign languages . The stream of magazine publications that followed the 1881 murder of Alexander II of Russia gave him the first impetus to draw . In 1882 , the Hrabars ( Hrabrovs ) relocated to Kiev , closer to the continuing trial of their mother and grandfather ; later in the same year , Emmanuil Hrabar accepted an appointment to Izmail . He sent Igor to Mikhail Katkovs boarding school in Moscow ; the schoolmaster waived tuition fee to a fellow slavophile . Igor Grabar , interested in drawing , soon made contacts with the students of the Moscow School of Painting , Sculpture and Architecture and already established artists - Abram Arkhipov , Vasily Polenov and the Schukins , wealthy patrons of art . Strapped for cash , he painted portraits of fellow students for a fee .",
      "In 1889 , Grabar was admitted to the Law Department of the Saint Petersburg University ; he made living by selling short stories to magazines and soon became the editor of Shut , the weakest of humour magazines that nevertheless paid well . His illustrations to books by Nikolay Gogol , signed Igor Hrabrov , inspired the young Aleksandr Gerasimov ( born 1881 ) , but Grabar generally stayed aside from drawing . He later complained that tabloid bohemianism completely overwhelmed him . In his second year at the university , Grabar moved up to the respectable Niva magazine . He selected graphics for Niva and wrote essays on contemporary painters but did not yet have enough influence to change its policies . Law-department classes were uninspiring and Grabar spent more time attending history lectures and Pavel Chistyakovs school of painting , but he still managed to graduate in law , without delay , in April 1893 .",
      "In the end of 1894 , he enrolled in Ilya Repins class at the Imperial Academy of Arts that has just been radically reformed . His classmates , the first spendid post-reform group , included Alexej von Jawlensky and Marianne von Werefkin who introduced him to French Impressionism , Konstantin Bogaevsky , Oleksandr Murashko , Nicholas Roerich and Arkady Rylov . Filipp Malyavin , Konstantin Somov , Dmitry Kardovsky also studied alongside Grabar but were admitted earlier . Grabar remained a fervent admirer of Repin for life but became quickly dissatisfied with academic studies and in July 1895 left for a brief study tour of Western Europe financed by Niva magazine .",
      "Munich .",
      "His return to Saint Petersburg finally persuaded him to drop out of the Academy ; in May 1896 , he and Kardovsky left for Munich via Berlin and Paris ; Jawlensky and Werefkin joined them later in summer . They enrolled at a private school of painting run by Anton A\u017ebe . Grabar , who soon became assistant to A\u017ebe , rated him as a poorly gifted painter , a superb draftsman and an outstanding teacher . Two years later , when Grabar was ready to leave A\u017ebe , he was offered an opportunity to open his own , competing , school ; A\u017ebe made a counter-offer , making Grabar his equal partner . The partnership existed for less than a year , from June 1899 until spring of 1900 , when Grabar accepted a lucrative offer from Prince Shcherbatov and left Munich .",
      "Grabar kept close ties with Saint Petersburg artists and publishers . In January\u2013February 1897 , Grabar , obliged to write for Niva , published an article defending avant-garde art against Vladimir Stasov , making a bombshell effect and inadvertently provoking Stasovs campaign against Repin as the dean of the Academy . Another article published in 1899 caused a conflict between Ilya Repin and Mir iskusstva .",
      "Life in Munich also aroused Grabars interest in architecture , and its history , that soon became his second profession . By 1901 , Grabar completed architects training at the Munich Polytechnicum but did not take the final exams .",
      "Mir Iskusstva .",
      "In 1901\u20131902 , Grabar presented twelve of his paintings at an exhibition hosted by Mir Iskusstva ; these were the first truly French impressionist works displayed in Russia by a Russian painter . One painting went straight to Tretyakov Gallery , others were auctioned to private collections .",
      "1903\u20131907 became Grabars highest point in painting ; according to Grabars Autobiography , the summit ( February\u2013April 1904 ) coincided with the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War . In this season , he practiced moderate divisionism with elements of pointillist technique . Three paintings of this period that Grabar himself considered seminal ( February Glaze , March Snow and Piles of Snow ) garnered wide and generally positive critical response . Kazimir Malevich wrote that , had it not been for linear perspective that Grabar preserved in his March Snow as a remnant of narrative from the nineteenth century , the whole picture would blend in a uniform painterly texture without clearly defined front and middle planes . In 1905 , Grabar travelled to Paris to study the new works of French postimpressionists and changed his technique in favor of complete separation of colours . Incidentally , although Grabar appreciated and studied C\u00e9zanne , Gauguin and Van Gogh , he himself ranked the king of painters Diego Vel\u00e1zquez above them all .",
      "At the end of 1905 and the beginning of 1906 , when Moscow was burning from riots and shellfire , Grabar tackled another challenging subject , frost , at the same time investing more and more time into writing and editing . Snow , and winter in general , remained his favorite subjects for life .",
      "Relations between Grabar and the founders of Mir Iskusstva were strained . Sergei Diaghilev tolerated Grabar as a business asset but feared and distrusted him as a potential new leader of the movement ; Grabar financial backing provided by Shcherbatov seemed especially menacing . Diaghilevs sycophants Nurok and Nouvelle led the opposition , Eugene Lansere and Konstantin Somov followed suit ; Valentin Serov was perhaps the only member who treated Grabar with sympathy . Grabar , indeed , used funds of Shcherbatov and Nadezhda von Meck to launch his own short-lived art society that failed to shake Mir Iskusstva and soon fell apart . Memoirs of the period , although biased , indicate that Grabar himself was a difficult person . According to Alexander Benois , Grabar practiced an unacceptably patronizing tone and at the same time , had absolutely no sense of humour . No one questioned his talent and encyclopedic knowledge , but Grabar was unable to persuade people or barely coexist with them in small communities like Mir Iskusstva . As a result , in 1908 Grabar broke with the movement completely and tried , in vain , to launch his own art magazine .",
      "Grabars History .",
      "In the same 1908 , Grabar abandoned painting in favor of writing ; he became chief editor and writer for Joseph Knebels series of books on Russian artists and Russian towns . He quickly amassed a wealth of historic evidence and settled on publishing a comprehensive History of Russian Art . Grabar initially concentrated on project management alone , leaving principal writing to Alexander Benois , but when the latter stepped aside in May , Grabar was compelled to pick up the writing task . He now concentrated on architecture ; only then did he realize that Russian architecture of the 18th century and earlier periods had never been properly studied . Grabar locked himself in the archives to study the subject for a year ; in July 1909 he took a short leave from writing and designed the Palladian Zakharyin Hospital in present-day Khimki , which was completed by the onset of World War I and operates to date .",
      "The first issue of History was printed in 1910 ; publication ceased with the 23rd issue in the beginning of 1915 when Knebels printshop and Grabars archive stored there were burnt in an anti-German pogrom . Of 2,630 pages in History , 650\u2014the issues on architecture\u2014were written by Grabar . History amalgamated works by the leading architects , artists and critics of the period . Ivan Bilibin , who contributed photography of vernacular architecture , used to say that we started appreciating old architecture only after Grabars book . Grabars own memoirs , however , focus on the failures of his co-authors : of all contributors only Fyodor Gornostayev was commended for doing his part .",
      "Grabars predecessors did not elaborate how art , and especially architecture fitted into the grand historical scheme ; his History became the first comprehensive work that attempted to solve the task . Grabar , accepting now-standard periodization of Russian history , applied the same scheme to history of architecture and emphasized the role of individual monarchs in it . His view of the transition from Naryshkin Baroque , the summit of Muscovite architecture , into loaned European Petrine Baroque as an organic process , however , was contentious from the start , and , according to James Cracraft , could not account for an abrupt demise of national architecture under Peter I and his successors . His own concept of Moscow Baroque , probably influenced by Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin , is not entirely consistent or clear . Soviet historians retained Grabars overall scheme , sealing the persistent lack of a clear and consistent , architecturally configured periodization of Russian architectural history. . Grabars concept of Moscow Baroque was challenged , his Ukrainian Baroque was trashed , yet Belarusian Baroque became a fixture of Soviet scholarship .",
      "Grabars understanding of lesser phenomena has been , at times , erroneous and his attributions were later dismissed . For example , he based the description of the 1591 Ambassadors Prikaz building on a fanciful and grossly distorted sketch by a Swede who visited Moscow after the building was torn down and replaced with a new one . His attribution and periodization of Menshikov Tower is also challenged . Nevertheless , James Cracraft ranked Grabar the first in the whole field of Russian art history , Dmitry Shvidkovsky wrote that Grabars History in whole remains unsurpassed , and William Craft Brumfield noted its immense importance for the preservation of medieval heritage .",
      "Tretyakov Gallery .",
      "On 2 April 1913 , the Board of the Tretyakov Gallery elected Grabar its trustee and executive director . He accepted the appointment on condition that the trustees give him unlimited authority in reforming the gallery . Later , he wrote that had he known the weight of this burden beforehand he would step back , but , inexperienced in public politics , he grabbed the opportunity of being there , among the subject of his History . Grabar planned to expand the former private collection into a comprehensive showcase of national art , including the controversial Russian and French modernist paintings . He laid out a program of artistic , scientific , educational-enlightening and social changes and eventually converted the gallery into a European museum .",
      "Grabar started with rearranging the paintings in public display ; when the gallery reopened in December 1913 , the main enfilade of its second floor was prominently terminated with Vasily Surikovs epic Feodosia Morozova . The first floor was now filled with completely new material - contemporary French painters and young Russians like Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin and Martiros Saryan . In the beginning of 1915 , Grabars purchasing decisions stirred a public scandal that involved practically all publicly known artists ; Victor Vasnetsov , Mikhail Nesterov , Vladimir Makovsky and Grabars former sponsor Shcherbatov called for immediate termination of his tenure . Debates continued until January 1916 , when Moscow City Hall approved Grabars reform in full . Grabar summarized his achievements in the 1917 catalogue of the Gallery , the first of its kind .",
      "The Russian Revolution of 1917 had dual effect on the gallery . Collapse of the monetary system and city utilities brought the gallery to a really catastrophic condition that was barely improved by nationalization in June 1918 . At the same time the gallery collection rapidly grew , absorbing nationalized private and church collections and formerly independent small museums . One by one its own exhibition halls were converted into art warehouses and closed to the public . By 1924 , the gallery operated four affiliate halls , in 1925 it disposed with foreign masters , but these measures could not offset the inflow of new stock . Physical expansion of the building became a first priority , and in 1926 Grabar was replaced with architect Aleksey Shchusev .",
      "Thriving under the Bolsheviks .",
      "In 1918 , Grabar took the lead of the Museums and Preservation Section of the Soviet Government , the Museum Fund and the Moscow-based state restoration workshops , becoming de facto chief curator of arts and architectural heritage for the whole Moscow region . As prescribed by the Bolsheviks in December 1918 , Grabars institutions catalogued all known heritage , an action tantamount to confiscation , and despite continuing war many nationalized landmarks were actually restored . Grabars group , like the contemporary Gorky Commission , was torn by a conflict of preservationists ( Grabar , Alexander Benois , Alexander Chayanov , Pyotr Baranovsky ) and destroyers ( David Shterenberg , Vladimir Tatlin ) and Grabar later complained that he had to offset two extremes , destruction of heritage and obstruction of avant-garde artists ( he was himself the main exponent of conservation ) . Grabar successfully exploited whatever allies he could recruit amongst the ambivalent Soviet bureaucracy , starting with the Commissar for Education Anatoly Lunacharsky , and even managed to retain his affluent lifestyle of the past .",
      "From 1919 , Grabar directed his commission into documenting and preserving Orthodox church murals and icons . The first 1919 expedition to Yaroslavl located and restored previously unknown works of the 12th and 13th centuries . Restorers Fyodor Modorov , Grigory Chirikov and photographer A . V . Lyadov continued studies of northern church art throughout the 1920s and by 1926 produced the first comprehensive study of icons and an assessment of wooden churches that housed them . Grabars icon restoration workshop became internationally known ; Alfred H . Barr , Jr . who visited Moscow in 1927\u20131928 , wrote of Grabars technology with great enthusiasm . It is to Grabar , more than to any other single scholar , that Russia owes the rediscovery of his icons .",
      "These appointments inevitably placed Grabar near the top of the Soviet machine of confiscating church and , to a lesser extent , privately held art treasures . Benois , who left the country , scorned Grabar for ripping Princess Mescherskaya of her Botticelli . Grabar accepted the fact of Bolshevik expropriation and concentrated on preservation of the treasures and setting up local museums to display them in public . His and Roman Kleins proposal to convert the whole Moscow Kremlin into a public museum failed , and the Kremlin was quickly taken over by the sprawling Red government . Among the masterpieces found during these campaigns was The Madonna of Tagil ( Madonna del Popolo ) taken from the Demidov house and attributed by Grabar to Raphael . Most , however , ended up at overseas auctions . Less formal attempts of individual artists to raise money in the United States failed : the 1924 show in New York City attracted 17 thousand visitors but raised only $30,000 and Grabar admitted We do not know what to do .",
      "1930s .",
      "In 1930 , Grabar left all his administrative , academic and editorial jobs , even that of an editor of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia , and concentrated on painting . Grabar himself wrote : I had to choose between the daily mounting administrative burden and creating .. . I had no choice . A personal pension granted by Sovnarkom hastened my retirement . According to Baranovsky and Khlebnikova , the decision was influenced by his mothers death ; Grabar the artist shifted his attention to problems of age , aging and death . According to Colton , the change followed a campaign of demolition inside the Kremlin ( Chudov Monastery ) and all over Moscow . The preservationist Old Moscow Society , unable to influence the authorities any longer , voted itself out of existence , and Grabars heritage commission was disbanded a few months later . Grabars influence over impending demolitions was now reduced to writing pleas to Stalin , as was the case of the Sukharev Tower in 1933\u20131934 .",
      "Grabar supervised another New York exhibition , this time of icon art , in 1931 and painted a string of official socialist realism epics but it was the 1933 Portrait of Svetlana that gave him an enormous and unwanted exposure at home and abroad . Grabar himself rated this portrait , painted in one day , among its best . The public identified its title subject as none other than Stalins daughter ( born in 1926 , she could not have been Grabars subject ; the legend persisted into the 1960s ) . Either this dangerous publicity , or his earlier association with Natalia Sedova and other trotskyists compelled Grabar to retire to relative obscurity . He kept on painting and wrote his Autobiography that was ready for print in June 1935 but was barred from publication until March 1937 . Contrary to the communist policy , Autobiography appreciated the formalist art of Mir Iskusstva and dismissed some critics applying Marxist analysis as utterly incompetent . In the same 1937 Grabar published Ilya Repin that earned him the State Prize four years later and began writing Serov . By 1940 , he was firmly back into the Soviet establishment and was featured in propagandist newsreels produced for distribution in Nazi Germany .",
      "World War II and beyond .",
      "In June 1943 , Grabar proposed tit-for-tat compensation of Soviet art treasures destroyed in World War II with art to be taken from Germany . Compiling the target list of German treasures was easy , but estimating own losses was not : by March 1946 , only nine out of forty major museums could provide an inventory of their losses . The government used Grabars proposal as a smoke screen : while Grabars deputy Victor Lazarev was discussing the legality of equitable reparations with the Allies , Soviet trophy brigades had practically completed a wholesale campaign of organized looting .",
      "Grabar consulted Joseph Stalin in preparation to Moscows 800-years jubilee celebrated in 1947 . He persuaded Stalin to return the former St . Andronik Monastery , once converted to a prison , if not to the church but to the artistic community . The remains of the monastery , restored by Pyotr Baranovsky , became the Andrey Rublyov Museum of Old Russian Art ( Grabar upheld Baranovskys dubious discovery of the alleged tomb of Andrey Rublyov ) . Grabar , as the senior in artistic community , retained some independence from the ideological pressure , as indicated by his 1945 obituary for the emigre Leonid Pasternak printed in Soviet Art .",
      "Things werent always smooth : in 1948 Grabar was caught in another campaign against random targets in art and science . He retained his administrative and university jobs and in 1954 co-authored Russian architecture of the first half of the 18th century , a revisionist study of the period that dismissed the knowledge collected by fellow historians before 1917 . He made an exception , though , for his own works that allegedly correctly understood the subject . Contrary to Grabars own understanding of East-West cultural relationship presented in History but in line with the rules of Soviet historiography , the new book claimed that Russians of the 18th century yield nothing in their work to foreign contemporaries and overstated the influence of folk tradition on polite architecture . These falsified theories , easily dismissed today , established the provincial outlook that governed the post-war generation of Soviet art historians .",
      "After Stalins death , Grabar was the first to publicly denounce run-off-the-mill socialist realism and pay the dues to once banished Aristarkh Lentulov and Pyotr Konchalovsky . The unsinkable Grabar earned derogatory nicknames Ugor Obmanuilovich ( cheating eel ) and Irod Graber ( Herod the Robber ) . Baranovsky and Khlebnikova noted that the reaction against Grabar was frequently provoked by his work at the helm of museum purchasing committees : mediocre artists inevitably had a grudge against his buying and pricing decisions .",

      "Jiminy Cricket",
      "Jiminy Cricket , also referred to as J . Crick , Young Crickey , and Big Cricket , is the Walt Disney version of the Talking Cricket ( Italian : Il Grillo Parlante ) , a fictional character created by Italian writer Carlo Collodi for his 1883 childrens book The Adventures of Pinocchio , which Disney adapted into the animated film Pinocchio in 1940 . Originally an unnamed , minor character in Collodis novel who is killed by Pinocchio before returning as a ghost , he was transformed for the Disney adaptation into a comical and wisecracking partner who accompanies Pinocchio on his adventures , having been appointed by the Blue Fairy ( known in the book as the Fairy with Turquoise Hair ) to serve as Pinocchios official conscience . In the film , he sings When You Wish Upon a Star , widely considered the Walt Disney Companys signature song .",
      "Jiminy Crickets appearance differs somewhat from that of actual crickets , which range from black to light brown and have long antennae and six legs ; Jiminy Cricket has short antennae , a greenish-brown hue , and four limbs ; like most Disney characterizations , he is bipedal . He dresses in the manner of a 19th- or early 20th-century gentleman , characteristically wearing a blue top hat and carrying a burgundy umbrella . Since his debut in Pinocchio , he has become an iconic major Disney character , making numerous other appearances , including in Fun and Fancy Free ( 1947 ) as the host and in Mickeys Christmas Carol ( 1983 ) as the Ghost of Christmas Past .",
      "Origin of name .",
      "The characters name is a play on the exclamation Jiminy Cricket! , a minced oath for Jesus Christ \u2013 which itself was uttered in Pinocchios immediate Disney predecessor , 1937s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by the seven dwarfs themselves . Other contemporary cinematic examples include : In the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz , Dorothy ( Judy Garland ) cries , Oh ! Oh ! Jiminy Crickets ! when she is startled by the Wizards pyrotechnics ; likewise , Garland uses the expression in the 1938 film Listen , Darling ; several times it is used in the 1930 movie Anna Christie ; and it occurs in the 1938 Mickey Mouse cartoon Brave Little Tailor . In addition , Jiminy Crickets is used in the 1919 novelty song Oh By Jingo ! as a euphemism for children ( Well have a lot of little Jiminy Crickets , we can use them for meal tickets ) .",
      "Creation .",
      "The character was designed by Ward Kimball , who had been very disappointed and was about to leave the Disney studio when much of the work he did for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was cut from the final version of that film .

He was originally performed by singer Cliff Edwards , who voiced the character for Disney through the 1960s and sang Jiminys most famous song , When You Wish Upon a Star . After Edwards death , Clarence Nash voiced him for a brief period of time , until 1973 , when Eddie Carroll took over the role as Jiminys voice actor . Carroll played the role for 37 years , until his death in 2010 . Actor Hal Smith voiced Jiminy in the Pinocchio Read-Along Storybook in 1992 . Actor Phil Snyder next voiced Jiminy for the Kingdom Hearts video game series . In 2014 , Snyder announced his retirement from voice acting to concentrate on his career teaching . Actor Joe Ochman took over the role at that time , beginning with Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remixs installment of , and he has been the voice of Jiminy since 2014 .",
      "Raphael Sbarge voices Jiminy in Once Upon a Time where he portrays him in human form as well . In the Italian dub of the Disney adaptation , Jiminy Cricket was voiced by Carlo Romano , who also dubbed for Fernandel in the Don Camillo series . In French he is voiced by Roger Carel , who is also the voice of Asterix and the French dub voices of Kaa from The Jungle Book and its sequel ; Basil of Baker Street from The Great Mouse Detective ; Winnie the Pooh ; and Boomer the woodpecker from The Fox and the Hound .",

Nevertheless , Jiminy shows him Scrooges bygone Christmases : ( Scrooge ) while working at Fezziwigs , and putting his money before his love , whom he never saw again . When Scrooge begs the minuscule ghost to take him away from these bad memories , Jiminy reminds him that he fashioned these memories himself .",

      "Big Brother ( Swedish TV series )",
      "Big Brother Sverige is the Swedish version of the reality television franchise Big Brother created by producer John de Mol in 1997 . The show followed a number of contestants , known as housemates , who are isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom-built house . Each week , one of the housemates is evicted by a public vote , with the last housemate remaining winning a cash prize .",
      "The show was aired from 2000 to 2004 on Kanal 5 , in 2011 and 2012 on TV11 , and 2015 on Kanal 11 .",
      "The eighth season began on 10 February 2020 on TV4 .",
      "Big Brother 1 .",
      "The first season of Big Brother Sverige started on 4 September 2000 and ended on 15 December 2000 lasting for 103 days . Being one of the first ten countries to air the format , the show saw several worlds first in the game .",
      "After nine original contestants entered the house on launch night , Daniel Hellstr\u00f6m would eventually walk only three days later . In the second week Eva Pederson , single mother of four , walked as well which resulted in only seven housemates being eligible for the first nomination and two replacements making their way into the house before the very first official eviction .",
      "Having a diverse cast , the audience witnessed a lot of arguments and misunderstandings between the contestants mainly between the sexual experiential housemates and the more conservative ones . Angelica Freij , the 33-year-old mother of six , felt offended by the close relationship between lesbian Anna B\u00e4ckelin and bisexual Paula Glantz . However , in a conversation with Anna , she admitted to never having any contact with homosexuals and the experience of living with some of them in the house ( many housemates stated to be bisexual in that season ) opened some new points of view for her which earned her a lot of sympathy from the viewers .",
      "The girl-girl relationship between Paula and Anna got troubled when females favorite Christoffer Jensen re-entered the house after being evicted and started to fancy Paula , who then decided to go hetero for the rest of the season and concentrated on Christoffer , mostly to Annas disappointment .",
      "Together with Christoffer , two new housemates entered the house on Day 61 with only one of them eventually being allowed to stay in the house as the replacement contestant for Johan Hellstr\u00f6m , who had , recently , voluntarily left the house . When the housemates voted for Christoffer to stay in the house , he became the first contestant to replace two different housemates ( he has also been the replacement for Daniel Hellstr\u00f6m earlier that series ) and Big Brother saw its first double eviction with Camilla Bj\u00f6rk and Dieck leaving the house at the very same time .",
      "It was also the first time in Big Brother history that a replacement housemate made it to the final day ( again Christoffer Jensen , who achieved the second runner up position ) and most prominently , that Angelica became the first woman worldwide to win the show .",
      "Being responsible for the very first reality TV show Expedition Robinson , Sweden embraced its first local Big Brother season and the show was a huge rating hit . Per Holknekt who finished fifth place in the first season became a well-known fashion designer .",
      "Big Brother Stj\u00e4rnveckan .",
      "After being off-air for more than a year , Big Brother Sverige returned with a spin-off called Big Brother Stj\u00e4rnveckan ( Week of the Stars ) on 20 January 2002 lasting for six days only and is , therefore , the shortest version of any Big Brother series worldwide . Seven former Swedish contestants from several reality shows lived together in the house with daily evictions . The show was aired in the week before the start of the actual second season of Big Brother Sverige and was supposed to create excitement between the viewers .",
      "The contestants that entered the house were Anki Lundberg from The Bar 3 , Johan Godzilla Lennstr\u00f6m and Anneli from Villa Medusa , Elizabeth Lelle Anderz\u00e9n from Expedition Robinson 1998 , Henric Olsson from The Bar 2 , Robert Robban Andersson from Expedition Robinson 1999 and Karin Stor from the first Big Brother Sverige season . However , being the only person that already experienced to be in the house did not work in Karins favor as she was the first person to be evicted .",
      "After a week , Anki Lundberg won the show on the day of the start of the second season .",
      "Big Brother 2 .",
      "Season two of Big Brother Sverige started on 26 January 2002 , exactly on the final day of Big Brother Stj\u00e4rnveckan lasting for 108 days until 13 May 2002 .",
      "To follow the footsteps of season one , the cast of the sophomore season included even more exotic and mostly very attractive contestants which saw more sexual interactions than any other Big Brother season of that time with once again a threeway relationship , this time between Dominique Pons and both Emma-Maria Carlsson and punk Kitty Jutbring . But when Emma-Maria voluntary left the house and Dominique was evicted in one of the earlier rounds the focus turned on other showmances such as between Elin Nilsson and Jacob Heidrich or Benjamin Sorani and Marie Picasso Pettersson .",
      "Marie was earlier voted to become the replacement for Emma-Marie between three different girls that entered the house together and Benjamin has been originally evicted on Day 62 but was allowed a return a week later after several viewers were unable to vote in what has been a close vote between him and fellow-nominee Jacob . However , when Big Brother offered the housemate that would walk 50,000 kronor Benjamin left the house voluntary only two weeks after his comeback .",
      "For the third time in a row , the Swedish audience chose a female to win their Big Brother season - this time it was Ulrica Andersson from Karlstad but the most famous housemate resulting from that season was undoubtedly Marie Picasso , who tried to break into music business with recording two singles and becoming the host of a call-in show without any significant success . In 2007 she auditioned for Swedens local version of Pop Idol called Idol 2007 which she won resulting in a no.1 single called This Moment .",
      "Big Brother 3 .",
      "Season three of Big Brother Sverige started on 25 January 2003 , lasting for 107 days until 11 May 2003 .",
      "Big Brother 4 .",

      "Carl Eric Almgren",
      "General Carl Eric \u00c5ke Almgren ( 4March 1913 \u2013 20May 2001 ) was a Swedish Army officer . Almgren served as Chief of the Defence Staff from 1961 to 1967 , military commander of the Eastern Military District ( Milo \u00d6 ) from 1967 to 1969 and as the Chief of the Army from 1969 to 1976 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Almgren was born on 4 March 1913 in Link\u00f6ping , Sweden , the son of captain Carl Almgren and his wife Esther ( n\u00e9e Tell ) . The father , Carl , who derived from a farming family , was a commissioned officer in the Life Grenadier Regiment , where he was among the more prominent representatives of his corps and had several positions both in the regiment and in the city of Link\u00f6ping . Carl Eric did very well in school and was chairman of the school association . It is said to have been a disappointment for Almgrens teacher that with his striking theoretical endowment did not choose the academic path . Almgren was an avid reader and in 1930 at the age of 17 he read , according to his reading records , 198 books ; ie almost four books per week .",
      "Almgren graduated from Link\u00f6pings h\u00f6gre allm\u00e4nna l\u00e4roverket with exceptionally high grades on 4 June 1931 . A week later he stood as an officer cadet outside the barracks of the Life Grenadier Regiment , the year after his father had resigned . At Military Academy Karlberg , he would have been the top student , if he had not been too outspoken . He graduated third best in his class and at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College he graduated with some of the best grades awarded . Almgren was appointed in April 1934 to officership at J\u00f6nk\u00f6pings-Kalmar Regiment . In 1936 he became a lieutenant and went through the Infantry Officer School . The winter of 1938 to 1939 , he studied Russian on a scholarship in Tallinn . Apart from Russian , he also spoke English , German and French fluently .",
      "Career .",
      "In October 1939 , Almgren was appointed assistant military attach\u00e9 in Tallinn , Riga , and Kaunas . With placement in Tallinn , he became interested in the tense global political activities . The Soviet Union invasion in 1940 ended his ability to act as attach\u00e9 , so he was told to observe the Soviet tanks when they crossed the Estonian border . During the war years he served , among other things , in the war preparedness organized army corps and division staffs and attended the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1941 to 1943 . Almgren was promoted to captain in 1942 and was an officer candidate in the General Staff Corps and the captain of the same in 1945 . In the next post-war years , he was placed at the Army Inspectorates Central Department and the Army Staffs Organization Department , while he taught at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College in tactics and staff service and a shorter time at the Swedish Air Force Flying School .",
      "In 1949 he was appointed captain of V\u00e4sternorrland Regiment ( I 21 ) and he was promoted to major in the General Staff Corps in 1951 . Almgren was a teacher at the newly established Swedish National Defence College from 1951 to 1953 and was placed at the Defence Staff and then as head of the Army Staffs Tactics Department . Almgren was promoted lieutenant colonel in the General Staff Corps in 1955 . He was head of the Defence Staffs Army Department , a central post with influence over operational planning and cooperation between the central staffs . He returned to the troop service as training officer in H\u00e4lsinge Regiment ( I 14 ) in 1957 and was appointed to colonel and commander of J\u00e4mtland Ranger Regiment ( I 5 ) in 1960 .",
      "Already the following year in 1961 he took up the post as Chief of the Defence Staff , while also being promoted to major general . In 1966 he was promoted to lieutenant general , and in 1967 he was appointed military commander of the Eastern Military District ( Milo \u00d6 ) , and also the Commandant General in Stockholm . Almgren took office as Chief of the Army on 1 October 1969 and served until 1976 . When he took office the Defence Act of 1968 had just been put into force . Having lost their previous political agreement between the Social Democrats and the centre-right parties , and it was obvious that the Supreme Commanders military and political assessments accorded less importance . The appropriations frame shrank , the fixed mark-up for technological development disappeared , and the carefully calculated price compensation system previously in force was replaced by a less favorable net price index .",
      "Among Almgrens contributions during his six years as Chief of the Armys was to improve leadership , staff treatment and training methods , as his predecessor Curt G\u00f6ransson had initiated and that despite no small resistance pushed through a merger of regiments and defense area staffs ; the provincial regiments thus regained its original role to both coordinate the defense of their own counties and train brigades for national defense . These far-sighted reforms survived , unfortunately , not the so-called restructuring in the 1990s . By the time of his retirement as army chief , he was promoted to general .",
      "Other work .",
      "Alongside the traditional career had his services been used in numerous investigations and special assignments . Almgren was secretary of the Army Officers Training Committee from 1943 to 1946 , member of the 1948 Air Defense Committee , expert in the committee for voluntary defence in 1949 , expert in the \u00d6B investigations of 1947 , 1954 , 1957 , 1962 and 1965 , expert in the 1962 Defence Committee and the 1965 Defense Investigation , member of the board of the Swedish Civil Defence League ( Sveriges civilf\u00f6rsvarsf\u00f6rbund ) from 1956 to 1957 , the Total Defences head-board ( Totalf\u00f6rsvaret chefsn\u00e4mnd ) , the Total Defences information board ( Totalf\u00f6rsvarets upplysningsn\u00e4mnd ) , the National Singal Security Board ( Statens signalskyddsn\u00e4mnd ) and the presidium of the Central Association of Society and Defence .",
      "Almgren was also a military employee of Stockholms-Tidningen in two periods 1943-1946 and 1952\u20131954 . During his time as Chief of the Army 1969-1976 he was at the same time chairman of the Swedish Army Museum . He put a great effort in the F\u00e4ltj\u00e4gare Association ( F\u00f6reningen F\u00e4ltj\u00e4gare ) in Stockholm and often attended meetings of the Swedish Military History Commission ( Svenska milit\u00e4rhistoriska kommissionen ) and could occasionally find amusement in the cultural evenings with the Idun Society ( S\u00e4llskapet Idun ) . At the military academy Almgren had served as a palace poet .",
      "He became an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Society of Naval Sciences and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 1952 . Almgren was chairman of the academys Section I , Land Warfare Studies from 1970 to 1975 and was president of the academy from 1969 to 1971 .",
      "Later life .",
      "In the obituaries Almgren was termed as extraordinarily talented and extremely hardworking . It also appears that he could be perceived as harsh in his criticism of the persons who in his opinion did not measure up . It also emphasizes that he gladly wrote verse that he performed on various occasions . He also had a strong Christian faith . After his resignation he got involved in The Salvation Army . In 1983 he entered the Salvation Armys counsel and worked actively to plan the activities in crisis situations . In the early 1990s , he followed closely the efforts to build the organization in the Baltic states .",
      "Among his former colleagues the perception of him was diverse . Lieutenant General Carl Bj\u00f6reman said that when you asked Almgren a question and came up with a proposal that he did not like , you felt as a subordinate officer but still not dejected . The opposite was not unusual . Almgren was for many years an active member of F\u00f6rsvarsfr\u00e4mjandet , an organization that primarily works with advocacy for a strong defense .",
      "Personal life .",
      "In 1938 he married Lisa Salomonsson ( 1910\u20131988 ) , the daughter of Anton Salomonsson and Edla ( n\u00e9e Sk\u00f6ld ) . Almgren was the father of Bo ( born 1943 ) and \u00c5ke ( born 1946 ) .",

      "Werner Hartenstein ( 27 February 1908 \u2013 8 March 1943 ) was a German naval officer during World War II who commanded the U-boat . He was a recipient of the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross , the highest award in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II . Hartenstein was credited with sinking 20 ships totaling , and with damaging three ships and a destroyer .",
      "Born in Plauen , Hartenstein joined the Reichsmarine ( navy of the Weimar Republic ) in 1928 . After a period of training on surface vessels and service on various torpedo boats during the Spanish Civil War and the first year of World War II , he transferred to the U-boat service in 1941 . In September 1942 , Hartenstein torpedoed and sank the , then attempted to rescue the survivors . He was forced to abort the rescue when his U-boat came under attack by a B-24 Liberator bomber of the United States Army Air Forces . The event became known as the Laconia incident and resulted in the Laconia Order , an order from the Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote to the entire German U-boat force that forbade rescuing the survivors of sunken ships . Hartenstein and the entire crew of U-156 were killed in action by depth charges from a US PBY Catalina aircraft on 8 March 1943 .",

      "Hartenstein was born in Plauen in the Vogtland of the Kingdom of Saxony , then a federated state of the German Empire , on 27 February 1908 . He was the second child of William Karl Adolf Hartenstein , an export merchant , and Selma Emma Hartenstein , n\u00e9e Schlingensiepen . Hartenstein had one older sister , Thea Irena , and a younger sister , Charlotte . He celebrated his confirmation in 1923 and graduated from a humanities-oriented secondary school in Plauen with his diploma ( Abitur ) in 1926 . After graduation in 1926 he applied for a naval officer cadetship but was rejected at first , and instead studied two semesters of jurisprudence . He matriculated at the University of Freiburg ( Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg ) in Freiburg im Breisgau on 29 April 1927 .",
      "Aged 20 , Hartenstein re-applied for the cadetship , was accepted and began his naval career with the Reichsmarine on 1 April 1928 as a member of Crew 28 ( the incoming class of 1928 ) . He underwent basic military training in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the Baltic Sea in Stralsund ( 1 April 1928 \u2013 30 June 1928 ) . Hartenstein was then transferred to the training ship Niobe ( 1 July 1928 \u2013 15 October 1928 ) , attaining the rank of Seekadett ( midshipman ) on 11 October 1928 . Following a 14-month stay on board the cruiser Emden ( 16 October 1928 \u2013 3 January 1930 ) he advanced in rank to F\u00e4hnrich zur See ( officer cadet ) on 1 January 1930 . Emden at the time was under the command of Lothar von Arnauld de la Peri\u00e8re , a U-boat commander during World War I . Hartenstein then underwent a number of officer training courses at the Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik , including navigational training cruises on the survey vessel Meteor , before transferring to the light cruiser K\u00f6ln ( 1 October 1931 \u2013 23 September 1934 ) . His stay on K\u00f6ln was occasionally interrupted to attend further training courses at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel-Wik . During this assignment on 30 January 1933 , the Nazi Party , under the leadership of Adolf Hitler , came to power in Germany , and began to rearm the navy . In 1935 , the Reichsmarine was renamed the Kriegsmarine .",
      "Hartenstein served as first watch officer on the torpedo boat from 30 September 1936 to 13 November 1938 . He was promoted to Kapit\u00e4nleutnant ( captain lieutenant ) on 1 June 1937 . Hartenstein participated in several patrols in 1937 and 1938 on board Greif in Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War . For these services he was awarded the Spanish Cross in Bronze ( ) on 6 June 1939 .",
      "World War II .",
      "At the outbreak of World War II , Hartenstein continued to serve on torpedo boats . In this position , he completed 65 patrols in the North Sea , Norwegian waters , the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel in the first one and a half years of the war . Hartenstein took command of torpedo boat on 20 November 1938 . In October 1939 Hartenstein transferred and switched command of torpedo boat with Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Franz Kohlauf who took over command of Seeadler . On 30 March 1941 , command of Jaguar was given to Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Friedrich-Karl Paul and Hartenstein transferred to the U-boat force , and on 4 September 1941 was given command of U-156 , a Type IXC U-boat . For his service on torpedo boats , Hartenstein was awarded the German Cross in Gold ( ) on 2 February 1942 . Karl D\u00f6nitz personally pinned the award on Harteinsteins leather jacket on 17 March 1942 . U-156 was first assigned to the 4th U-boat Flotilla at Stettin as a training boat , then was transferred to the 2nd U-boat Flotilla at Lorient , France , on 31 December 1941 .",
      "First patrol .",
      "Hartensteins first patrol ( 24 December 1941 \u2013 10 January 1942 ) was an uneventful transfer patrol taking U-156 from Kiel to Lorient . U-156 , together with and , transited through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal , passing Brunsb\u00fcttel where they joined up with a pathfinder and . The convoy received aerial protection from Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter aircraft and split up once they reached Cuxhaven . Passing south of the Shetland Islands , bypassing the Hebrides , U-156 slowly approached Rockall , where two weather buoys ( , or WFB ) were released : WFB 33 on 7 January 1942 at , and WFB 32 on 8 January 1942 at 02:44 at in the Porcupine Bank . U-156 received a radio message on the evening of 8 January ordering Hartenstein to proceed at high speed to Lorient , where it arrived on 10 January 1942 .",
      "Second patrol .",
      "On his second patrol ( 19 January 1942 \u2013 17 March 1942 ) Hartenstein commanded a wolfpack of U-boats ( Gruppe Neuland\u2014Group New Land ) during the Attack on Aruba in February 1942 , attacking an oil refinery . U-156 along with under the command of G\u00fcnther M\u00fcller-St\u00f6ckheim and under the command of J\u00fcrgen von Rosenstiel departed from Lorient under the protection of a pathfinder in the early morning of 19 January 1942 . Hartensteins orders were to conduct a simultaneous surprise attack of the Gruppe Neuland against the shipping traffic off Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao . Besides U-156 , U-67 and U-502 , Gruppe Neuland also included the submarines under the command of Nicolai Clausen and under the command of Albrecht Achilles .",
      "On 16 February , after observing the area for a few days , U-156 came around to the refineries . There in front of her target were two Lago Company flat-bottom steamers , and , both British-owned oilers . At 01:31 , U-156 surfaced in San Nicolaas Harbour some offshore and attacked the two British tankers at anchor . Hartenstein fired one torpedo from his bow tubes at Pedernales . The torpedo attack was successful and Pedernales was hit amidships . Loaded with crude oil , the steamer immediately burst into flames , killing eight of her 26 crewmen and wounding her captain Herbert McCall . Oranjestad then began to lift anchor and steam away but she was too late and was hit by a second torpedo fired from U-156 . She too burst into flames and sunk an hour later in about of water . Fifteen of her 22 crewmen were killed .",
      "At 03:13 , U-156 attacked the Texaco-owned tanker SS Arkansas which was berthed at Eagle Beach next to the Arend/Eagle Refinery . Just one of the torpedoes struck Arkansas and partially sank her but the damage was moderate and caused no casualties . Commander Hartenstein then steamed further around Aruba and directed his men to take to the deck guns and prepare for a naval bombardment of the large oil tank of the Lago Oil and Transport Company The crew of the 10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun forgot to remove the tampion from the barrel , so when Hartenstein ordered them to fire , the gun blew up . Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly , one foot having been severed . His comrade and trigger man Heinrich B\u00fcssinger was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack . Hartenstein ordered the 3.7 cm flak gun to continue the attack , causing only superficial damage .",
      "Third patrol .",
      "On Hartensteins third patrol ( 22 April 1942 \u2013 7 July 1942 ) , U-156 sank 12 ships and damaged a further two , including the on 25 May 1942 . This achievement earned Hartenstein a reference on 6 June 1942 in the Wehrmachtbericht , a propaganda bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht , the OKW . The mention was entered in the orders and decorations section of a soldiers Service Record Book .",
      "U-156 along with U-502 again departed from Lorient under the protection of a pathfinder on 22 April 1942 destined for the Caribbean Sea . Prior to the departure Dietrich von dem Borne , who had been severely wounded on the second patrol , was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See of the Reserve Gert Mannesmann . Chief engineer Wilhelm Polchau reported to Hartenstein on 6 May that the diesel compressor had malfunctioned . Hartenstein radioed under the command of Robert-Richard Zapp to assist . On 10 May U-156 and U-66 rendezvoused and exchanged of fuel oil for the necessary spare parts , and the fuel compressor was repaired . U-156 sighted the first steamer in the early afternoon on 12 May , the first of twelve ships\u2014eleven merchantmen and one warship\u2014attacked on this patrol , ten of which were sunk .",
      "U-156 , positioned near Fort-de-France , was ordered to observe the traffic to and from Martinique . At roughly offshore , the hydrophones detected a ship . Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position firing two torpedoes . One torpedo struck the bow of the Blakeley after a 25-second run-time . Hartenstein observed that the bow was completely blown away , but its engines kept running . The waters around Martinique were extremely shallow and Hartenstein decided not to pursue the destroyer . On 1 June 1942 , Hartenstein was promoted to Korvettenkapit\u00e4n ( corvette captain ) . The first watch officer , Paul Just , left U-156 after returning from the third patrol . Just was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See Leopold Schumacher as new first watch officer . Just later became commander of , and .",
      "Hartenstein and the entire crew of U-156 received a heros welcome by the residents of Plauen on 20 July 1942 . The people lined the streets as the whole crew marched from the railway station to the City Hall for the official welcome reception .",
      "Fourth patrol and Laconia incident .",
      "On U-156s fourth patrol ( 20 August 1942 \u2013 16 November 1942 ) , Hartenstein sank and then organised the rescue of the survivors of RMS Laconia , resulting in the Laconia incident and Laconia Order .",
      "U-156 together with under the command of Karl-Friedrich Merten departed from Lorient on 20 August 1942 heading for the Bay of Biscay . Hartenstein received the order to operate against Convoy SL-119 on 25 August . After a two-day pursuit , U-156 found a straggler , the SS Clan Macwhirter , west of Casablanca . Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position to avoid detection under the bright moonlight . Clan Macwhirter was hit by two torpedoes and sank , killing nine members of the crew and two gunners ; 79 sailors survived the sinking . Two later sightings on 2 and 6 September did not lead to favourable attack positions .",
      "On 12 September 1942 U-156 was patrolling off the coast of West Africa midway between Liberia and Ascension Island roughly south of Cape Palmas . At 11:37 the aft port lookout sighted a smoke stack at 230 degrees . Hartenstein followed the target , which was zigzagging at , until the general direction of the large ocean liner became evident . U-156 was running at into a favourable attack position , and Hartenstein ordered the attack at 21:07 . He slowed speed at 22:00 and ordered surfaced deflection shots from torpedo tubes I and III . After three minutes and six seconds the first torpedo detonated , then the second . He had hoped to capture the ships senior officers , but to his surprise , Hartenstein saw over two thousand people struggling in the water . Hartenstein immediately began rescue operations . Laconia sank at 23:23 .",
      "At 01:25 on 13 September 1942 Hartenstein radioed the Befehlshaber der U-Boote ( BdU\u2014commander of U-boats ) requesting guidance and confirmation on how to proceed . The BdU responded at 03:45 ordering Wolf pack Eisb\u00e4r , consisting of under the command of Harro Schacht , under the command of Erich W\u00fcrdemann and under the command of Georg von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf , to assist Hartenstein immediately . At 06:00 Hartenstein ordered that the following message be sent on the 25m wavelength :",
      "If any ship will assist the ship-wrecked Laconia crew , I will not attack providing I am not being attacked by ship or air forces . I picked up 193 men . 4\u00b053 South/11\u00b026 West \u2013 German submarine",
      "The message was repeated twice on the international 600m wavelength . The BdU later changed the order slightly and U-506 , U-507 and the Italian submarine Capellini were dispatched . In parallel U-156 was assisting and supplying the survivors in the numerous lifeboats that kept arriving or were picked up . U-506 arrived at 11:32 on 14 September 1942 , followed by U-507 in the afternoon of 15 September . Heading to a rendezvous with Vichy French ships under Red Cross banners , the U-boats were attacked by a U.S . Army B-24 Liberator bomber ( 343d Bomb Squadron ; Lieutenant James D . Harden ) at 12:32 on 16 September 1942 . The attack ordered by Captain Robert C . Richardson III , which killed a number of people in the lifeboats and damaged U-156 , forced Hartenstein to abandon the rescue operations . A majority of survivors were later rescued by British merchant ships and two Vichy French warships , the cruiser Gloire and the sloop Annamite , out of Dakar , Africa .",
      "This event later became known as the Laconia incident and led BdU Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz to issue the Laconia order to his U-boat commanders that stated in part No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing members of ships sunk .. . At the end of the war , the Laconia Order was unsuccessfully used against Admiral D\u00f6nitz in his war crime trial . The prosecution failed when Fleet Admiral Nimitz testified that in the war with Japan the United States Navy had followed the same general policy as was set forth in the German admirals directive .",
      "U-156 received a radio message on 17 September 1942 indicating that Werner Hartenstein had become the 63rd member of the U-boat service and the 125th of the Kriegsmarine to be awarded Germanys highest military honour , the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross ( ) . Hartenstein issued a bottle of beer to each member of the crew and held a speech honouring the achievements of everyone on board , and telling them that he would wear the decoration in their name .",
      "On 19 September 1942 , U-156 was roughly south of Freetown and the crew was still repairing minor damage , when the lookout spotted a ship at 04:30 . The target was the British ship Quebec City , en route from Cape Town to Freetown . Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position and hit Quebec City with one torpedo fired from tube VI . Hartenstein surfaced and approached the lifeboats and asked the survivors for the ships name . Quebec City did not sink easily and U-156 fired 58 rounds from the 37 mm ( 1.46 in ) flak gun and seven further shots from the 10.5 cm gun before Hartenstein ordered a cease fire . After a direct hit in the ships stern ammunition magazine and an explosion , Quebec City slowly sank . According to William Clark , a member of Quebec Citys crew , Hartenstein made sure that the survivors had enough water and provisions and that Captain William Thomas had the exact coordinates . This account of that attack and the impression that the humanitarian actions of Hartenstein made is documented in the book by David Cledlyn Jones , The Enemy We Killed , My Friend . Jones himself disagrees , stating that Hartenstein was concerned about the survivors well-being but did not inquire about provisions , nor did he offer additional food or water . Hartenstein did express that it would have been his wish to tow them at least some distance to the African coast , but explained that he was not able to do so as he recently had been attacked while attempting to aid survivors .",
      "Fifth patrol and death .",
      "During his fifth patrol ( 16 January 1943 \u2013 8 March 1943 ) , on 8 March 1943 , Hartenstein and the entire crew of U-156 were killed in action by depth charges from a U.S . PBY Catalina aircraft ( VP-53/P-1 ; Lieutenant E . Dryden ) , east of Barbados . The Catalina dropped four Mark 44 Torpex water-bombs at 13:15 from an altitude of to which straddled U-156 . Two bombs were observed to hit the water to starboard and just aft of U-156 , lifting it and breaking it in two , followed by an explosion . At least eleven survivors were seen swimming in the water . The Americans dropped two rubber rafts and rations , and five men were seen to reach one of the rafts . The USS Barney was dispatched from Trinidad to rescue the survivors . The search was abandoned on 12 March 1943 . Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Ernst Kals , chief of the 2nd U-boat Flotilla at Lorient , sent a letter to Hartensteins parents on 23 April 1943 indicating that their son had been posted as missing in action as of 12 March 1943 . U.S . officials announced the destruction of the U-boat on 10 May 1943 .",
      "Ten months after his death a service of remembrance was held in Plauen on 15 January 1944 . The service was attended by his parents , his sisters and other members of the family , the mayor of Plauen , Eugen W\u00f6rner , senior officials and councillors . The local press reported that His parents have accepted that their loving son will not return home but is resting in peace with his Lord . Werner Hartenstein was portrayed by German actor Ken Duken in the 2011 TV mini-series The Sinking of the Laconia .",

      "The Bayerisches Armeemuseum is the Military History Museum of Bavaria . It was founded in 1879 in Munich and is located in Ingolstadt since 1972 . The main collection is housed in the New Castle , the permanent exhibition about the First World War in Reduit Tilly opened in 1994 and the Armeemuseum incorporated the Bayerisches Polizeimuseum ( Bavarian Police Museum ) in the Turm Triva in 2012 . Today , part of the former Munich Museum building is the central building of the new Bayerische Staatskanzlei ( Bavarian State Chancellery ) .",
      "History .",
      "Museum in Munich .",
      "The museum was founded in 1879 by King Ludwig II of Bavaria at the suggestion of General Friedrich von Bothmers and the Minister of War Joseph Maximilian von Maillinger . It was to bring together the collections that were scattered throughout Bavaria . First director was Josef W\u00fcrdinger ( 1822-1889 ) . Until 1905 , it was located in Munich in the arsenal of the Bavarian army and then moved after five years of construction , into a new monumental building at the Hofgarten in Munich ; where the Hofgartenkaserne ( court garden barracks ) had previously stood , and was based on the plans by Ludwig von Mellinger .",
      "During the Second World War , the building was partially destroyed . The preserved dome of the old museum building in Munich is the central building of the newly established Bayerische Staatskanzlei ( state chancellery ) today . From 1946 to 1969 , the Armeemuseum was housed in the Bavarian National Museum in Munich .",
      "Museum in Ingolstadt .",
      "Director Peter Jaeckel ( 1972-1979 ) .",
      "The collection on military history arrived in the New Castle in Ingolstadt , in 1969 . The city had been the seat of the Dukes of Bavaria-Ingolstadt and as a former Bavarian mainland fortress , possessed a rich military tradition and numerous references to the Bavarian army . In 1972 the museum was opened under the direction of director Peter Jaeckel . The permanent exhibition designed and furnished at that time remained unchanged until 2014 .",
      "Director Ernst Aichner ( 1979-2010 ) .",
      "In 1979 , Ernst Aichner became museum director and expanded the museums collections significantly . He paid particular attention to the First World War and the Bavarian military paintings , such as those by artists like Anton Hoffmann or Louis Braun . Even more from unknown artists , who have immortalized the events of Bavarian and European military history through their paintings , were collected by Aichner and represent an important asset of the museum today .",
      "Other acquisitions , such as a raffle of 6,000 Nazi propaganda art works seized by the United States at the end of Second world War in 1986 , were never processed , even though the United States had made it a condition for the sale that they be processed in a museum . Aichner sent about 700 of the war paintings to the Deutsches Historisches Museum ( German Historical Museum ) in Berlin and to the Bundeswehr Military History Museum ( Military History Museum of the German Armed Forces ) in Dresden . The processing of the remaining objects in Ingolstadt waited until he had set up the planned department for Second World War .",
      "In the same year , they also set up a Starfighter in the museum court yard , to which other military historians noted that a reference of the exhibit on the history of the 1683 established and 1918/19 disbanded Bavarian army was difficult to recognize .",
      "In 1988 , the Bavarian state parliament decided that a museum education concept should be created for the museum .",
      "In connection with the Bavarian State Garden Show in Ingolstadt in 1992 , Aichner developed ambitious expansion plans for his museum . Therefore , in addition to the previous , not yet fully used headquarters in the New Castle , all historic military buildings on the southern bank of the Danube in Ingolstadts old town were to be used for expansion . Making the Armeemuseum the third largest military history museum in Europe . Ingolstadt lawyers , doctors , teachers and artists feared for Ingolstadts reputation as a cultural city and founded with the local SPD member of Parliament Manfred Schuhmann , the initiative culture instead of cannon , the Ingolstadt-based car manufacturer Audi was also concerned about the image of its headquarters .",
      "In March 1993 , a tin soldier with SS attributes was offered for sale at the souvenir stall of the museum treasury , which led to investigations in the Armeemuseum for use of markings of unconstitutional organizations . Minister of Culture , Hans Zehetmair , said at a parliamentary questioning by the Alliance 90/The Greens Chairman , Manfred Fleischer , that he waits for the outcome of the investigation , but regardless of the decision , he believes that the exhibition of objects that had nothing to do with the history of the Bavarian Army and which were considered as overzealous , were nothing of the such . An employee of Aichner received a fine on the matter , and the case against Aichner was discontinued by the prosecution .",
      "While the 700,000 DM , which was collected by the circle of friends of the museum was being spent on new acquisitions , which were mostly stored in the extensive museum depots , the exhibition for the First World War opened only in the Summer of 1994 , more than two years after the scheduled date all because of missing 20,000 DM for educational information boards . For this exhibition , the parliamentary decision on the museum educational concept was also implemented , whereas for the main exhibition only came into effect with the reorganization after the national exhibition of 2015 . The Reduit Tilly has become one of the few special museums of the First World War in recent years , and not only because the war reality is made physically tangible there was it universally recognized . The 100th anniversary of the beginning of the war not only increased public interest , but also the lending of exhibits to other museums increased significantly .",
      "In addition , in 2007 , the police history collection of the Bavarian State Police from Bamberg was transferred to the Armeemuseum . It contains historical information about the K\u00f6niglich Bayerisches Gendarmeriekorps ( Bavarian Gendarmerie ) , the Bavarian police during the National Socialist era and , in general , the development of the municipal and city police as well as the state , water protection , border and riot police . Under the organizational roof of the Armeemuseum , the collection was opened as its own Bayerisches Polizeimuseum ( Bavarian Police Museum ) only after several years of delay , on 19 December 2011 , with a concept developed under the new director , Ansgar Rei\u00df . The police museum is housed in the Turm Triva in the immediate vicinity of the Reduit Tilly .",
      "Aichner pursued his expansion plans until his retirement at the end of January 2010 : His last major act was the opening of an exhibition on the history of the Deutsche Gebirgstruppe ( German mountain troops ) from 1915 to today , in which the foundation Deutsche Gebirgstruppe was founded . The controversial surrounding the group because of its relationship to war crimes of the German Wehrmacht Kameradenkreis ( circle of comrades ) , became the basis for the contribution of all of the mountain troops exhibits and documents to the foundation . Under Aichners successor , the museum critically took on a special exhibition on the beginnings of the German mountain troops ( 17 September 2014 to 27 September 2015 ) . Further special exhibitions on this topic are in preparation .",
      "Director Ansgar Rei\u00df ( since 2010 ) .",
      "On February 1 , 2010 , Ansgar Rei\u00df took up the post as the new museum director . After an exhibition on African American US soldiers during the occupation , the traveling exhibition hosted the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe on the theme of Nazi military justice in 2011 .",
      "It was followed by exhibitions on topics such as the Die Polizei im NS-Staat ( police in the Nazi state ) , K\u00f6nig Ludwig II , Milit\u00e4rischer Widerstand gegen Hitler und das NS-Regime ( military resistance against Hitler and the Nazi regime ) , Fotografien aus dem Afghanistan Einsatz der Bundeswehr ( photographs from the Afghanistan mission of the Bundeswehr ) or Krankenpflege im Ersten Weltkrieg ( nursing in the First World War ) .",
      "In 2014 , the museum put a focus on the commemoration of the 100 Jahre Erster Weltkrieg ( 100 years of First World War ) . A large number of special exhibitions , events and publications filled up this special year and brought the museum a large increase in visitors .",
      "Today , the museum sees its task in the critical and historically accurate reflection of military and military violence in history and its effects on man , society and the state . Through the publication of an annual report for the years 2010 to 2014 , they stated that the museum and the public are accountable for themselves .",
      "From 30 April to 31 October 2015 , the Bavarian State Exhibition Napoleon und Bayern took place in the New Castle , which was very successful with almost 150,000 visitors . For this exhibition , the previous permanent exhibition was removed , and the museum was renovated to become barrier-free . After the end of the national exhibition , the Armeemuseum will relocate gradually starting in 2018 to the same premises with a newly designed exhibition .

      "The fortunes of the museum have been accompanied for decades by the Verein der Freunde des Bayerischen Armeemuseums ( Association of Friends of the Bavarian Armeemuseum ) based in Munich . In addition to various representatives of Bavarian aristocracy and officer corps , counted in 1967 , museum director Ernst Aichner was also a student among the founding members . Chairman , from 1989 to 2016 , was the former CSU member of parliament and long-time head of external relations of Eurocopter , Manfred Dumann . After the Bavarian Ministry of Science , which has been under FDP leadership since 2009 , chose a successor without Aichner friendship circle , leading members of the friendship such as Ingolstadts Second Mayor Albert Wittmann ( CSU ) were initially irritated and did not want to rule out an FDP plot against Horst Seehofer . After the contact between Dumann and the new museum director had normalized , the special exhibition on the Nazi military justice and its victims caused a low point of the relationship . Relying on his status as the son of a fallen Wehrmacht soldier , Dumann criticized a blanket defamation of lawyers and bias on the part of exhibition organizers , prompting Rei\u00df to conclude that the museum was not a sanatorium for offended Wehrmacht souls . By changing the articles of association , the foundations of further cooperation between the museum and the circle of friends were redefined and the responsibilities clearly defined . A new board of trustees was appointed for the association under the direction of Prince Wolfgang von Bayern .",
      "In August 2016 , Dumann resigned from the chair due to his age . The new chairman was Ernst Aichner , former director of the Armeemuseum . The board includes , among others , mayor Albert Wittmann and the deputies Robert Brannek\u00e4mper and Reinhard Brandl ( each CSU ) .",
      "On 7 October 2017 , an article was published in the Donaukurier referring to revisionist and legal texts on the website of the Association of Friends . Museum director Rei\u00df pointed out on demand by the newspaper that he had already informed Aichner by letter in July on this obvious maladministration and asked the association to delete the texts . When this did not happen , the museum director publicly distanced himself from the association and criticized the publication of these right-wing texts violently . All links to the association have been removed from the museums homepage . Aichner stated that he had instructed the administrator of the association website after the notice by Rei\u00df , that the texts which incidentally had not been approved by him , to be remove from the internet . He then assumed that the matter had been settled . In actual fact , only the links to the texts had been removed , but direct access was still possible . According to Aichner , the administrator has since been deprived of access to the associations website .",

      "Aero Union",
      "Aero Union Corporation was an aircraft operation and maintenance company based in Chico , California , United States . They were known for operating aerial firefighting aircraft , training crews and making custom designed firefighting systems tailored to specific aircraft requirements . After years of controversies regarding the operation of the company and the safety of their planes , the U.S . Forest Service ( USFS ) canceled its contract , and the company was forced to shut down soon after .",
      "History .",
      "In 1960 Dale Newton and Dick Foy participated in their first fire season with a surplus B-25 Mitchell . Newton & Foy operated for that season under the name Western Air Industries . The following year they purchased their first two B-17 Flying Fortresses and changed their name to Aero Union . In 1962 the company moved their operations from Redding , California to Chico .",
      "Between 1975 and 2000 , the company used Douglas C-54 aircraft as tankers and as general support aircraft , nine being in use in April 1990 .",
      "Move from Chico .",
      "In June 2010 Aero Union announced plans to move the majority of its operations to McClellan Airfield ( formerly McClellan Air Force Base ) just outside Sacramento . Reasons stated for the move include needing larger , more consolidated facilities , access to a larger labor pool and being closer to its primary customers . A smaller scale Chico operation continued to be maintained for several months to provide additional storage and flexibility . The relocation began in September 2010 but ended abruptly with the closure of the company .",
      "Airtanker scandal .",
      "Aero Union was one of six contractors involved in the U.S . Forest Service airtanker scandal . The aging U.S . C-119 Flying Boxcar firefighting fleet , including some Aero Union aircraft , was grounded in 1987 due to safety concerns ; this greatly reduced the USFSs aerial firefighting capability . To quickly replace retired aircraft and modernize , the USFS organized a deal with the Department of Defense and the General Services Administration to exchange the grounded planes for more modern C-130A Hercules and P-3 Orion aircraft . The exchange program eventually allowed the contractors to acquire twenty-eight aircraft at no cost , but an absence of publicity or a public bid process led to accusations of cronyism , and the exchange was illegally carried out by the USFS : instead of merely allowing contractors to operate government-owned aircraft as per the interagency agreement , many titles were transferred , effectively giving aircraft away for free . At least four such aircraft were dismantled for parts by Aero Union and TBM . Aero Union also exchanged other planes with the USFS , with the government retaining the titles and ownership , and was required to maintain and operate them for firefighting duties . Instead , Aero Union dismantled some of them , selling parts for profit . Aero Union made an out of court settlement with the government over its actions but this was later challenged in court .",
      "Closure .",
      "On July 29 , 2011 the U.S . Forest Service announced that it had canceled its six-plane contract with Aero Union after the companys planes failed their required safety inspections . In April 2011 Aero Union had voluntarily disclosed that its planes were not current on inspections and were in violation of the contract . The contract , worth about $30 million a year , made up about 95% of the companys income . Less than a month later Aero Union informed its employees that they were out of work and that the company was shutting down operations . That August Aero Union failed to make its lease payments to the City of Chico and the lease was declared invalid by the city that September due to concerns that the city would be unable to re-lease the facilities if they became tied up in bankruptcy proceedings . Reduced to a staff of 5 people after the last round of layoffs , down from approximately 230 in 2008 , CEO Brett Gourley claimed \u201cThe company is in sort of hibernation mode\u201d and was looking for other sources of income . Aero Union has since completely shutdown all of its facilities , websites and other points of contact and is assumed to be out of business . In February 2012 PMI held an auction of Aero Unions aircraft assets , including 8 P-3 Orion aircraft , various spare parts and their intellectual property ( MAFFS II and FIREHAWK firefighting systems ) . Only two aircraft were bid upon and those bids were rejected as being too low . In May 2012 another auction of tools and equipment , but no aircraft , parts or intellectual property , went through with the majority of it selling .",
      "Former Aero Union Tanker 23 acquired by Airstrike Firefighters , with plans for 6 more P-3s .",
      "MAFFS II .",
      "One of the companys last projects was an improved version of the Modular Airborne FireFighting System under contract to the USFS . Originally designed for C-130J model aircraft and later modified to fit on C-130H models , the new MAFFS II system has a capacity of up to 3,400 gallons , replacing the five retardant tanks with one large tank , and has an on-board air compressor . The original MAFFS has to be pressurized by a compressor on the ground as a part of the loading process . The ability to pressurize the system in the air cuts turn-around time , but adds substantial weight . The new system discharges the retardant through a special plug in the paratroop drop door on the side of the aircraft , rather than requiring the cargo ramp door to be opened ; this allows the aircraft to remain pressurized during the drop sequence .",
      "Aero Union delivered the first production unit to the USFS in July , 2007 , with flight testing that following August . MAFFS II was used for the first time on a fire in July 2010 .",

The Lowell School Committee and the city council lobbied hard for the Normal School , eventually beating out the town of Lawrence for the honor . Along with Lowell , normal schools were created in Barnstable , Fitchburg , and North Adams .",
      "Lowell Normal School opened in 1897 with 108 students\u20143 men joined the first class of 105 female students\u2014and five faculty members . The two-year program prepared teachers to work in grades 1-9 . Required classes included educational methods and psychology and how to teach various subjects to children including English , mathematics , science , and drawing .",
      "The original classroom building opened the next year at the corner of Broadway and Wilder streets and quickly became a landmark in the city . Designed by local firm Stickney & Austin , it reflects the fashion of the time : high-style Beaux Arts with classical symmetry , arches , cast-iron lampposts and yellow brick . Its design was influenced in part by Lowell High School , which was also designed by Lowell native Frederick W . Stickney . Frank Coburn , for whom the hall was later named , served as the schools first principal until 1908 .",
      "The main mission of the school at that time was to prepare students for the teaching of elementary education . Courses typically took two years , with the third and fourth years optional because of space in the building . In 1910 , the mission of the school expanded with the creation of a three-year music program .",
      "As the mission of the school was to train the students , they needed space so that the students would be able to practice their skills . The nearby Bartlett Training School was first used when 27 rooms were made available .",
      "Principals of the Normal School included : Frank Coburn ( 1897-1907 ) ; Cyrus A . Durgin ( 1908-1916 ) ; John Mahoney ( 1916-1922 ) ; and Clarence Weed ( 1922-1935 ) .Teresa Garland Lew and Marion Scott Lew were notable graduates of the Lowell Normal School ( Class of 1914 ) . Members of an historically important African-American family within the Dracut/Lowell area , they were the first African Americans to graduate from the Normal School . Teresa Garland Lew went on to teach for 21 years at the Bartlett Training School and obtained a law degree from Portia Law School in Boston . Marion Lew was one of the first graduates of the new music program at the Normal School .",
      "Lowell Teachers College ( 1932-1959 ) .",
      "In the early 1930s , Lowell Normal School transitioned to Lowell Teachers College becoming a four-year program for the training of teachers .",
      "The years prior to this transition were challenging for the Normal School as enrollments steadily declined and the job situation for teachers worsened . An economic boom in the 1920s that accompanied the peak of the textile industry led to a building boom across Lowell . However , this was followed by the depression , and , for Lowell , massive loss of jobs and wages and a 12% drop in population .",
      "In 1938 , in order to balance budgets state legislators considered a suggestion to close several normal schools . School administrators rallied local support to help keep it open . A delegation of prominent individuals representing Lowells powerful interest groups traveled to Boston and convinced state officials of the schools importance . The result was that the school not only survived but continued to grow and expand .",
      "James M . Dugan ( 1936-1950 ) led the school through these challenging years . He was the first Catholic to be selected to head the school . He revitalized curriculum , hired new staff , and sought accreditation with the American Association of Teachers Colleges .",
      "Dugans tenure was followed by Daniel H . OLeary ( 1950-1965 ) who oversaw the next transition from four-year teachers college to comprehensive state college in 1960 .",
      "Mary A . Halleren ( class of 1927 ) was a particularly well known graduate . She taught at the Normal School for 15 years before she joined the Womens Army Corps in 1942 , where she rose steadily through the service to eventually become director before she retired in 1960",
      "Lowell State College ( 1960-1975 ) .",
      "As the demand for more qualified teachers grew , the legislature reorganized the Normal School into Lowell State College in 1960 with a curriculum that expanded beyond education to include baccalaureate degrees in other fields including nursing and music . Beginning in 1967 , the college was authorized to confer two graduate degrees : Master of Education and Master of Music Education .",
      "In addition to education , Lowell State College also expanded to include a school of nursing . Gertrude Barker led the charge for the program on campus , eventually becoming Dean of the College of Health Professions . A specialist in the field of aging , she became a fellow in the American Academy of Nursing in 1980 .",
      "On other fronts within the college , liberal arts programs were expanding and the numbers of faculty holding the Ph.D . degree also increased .",
      "In 1950 , Daniel OLeary assumed the presidency and initiated an ambitious building program . The physical plant of the campus expanded during post-war era from a single structure to a multi-building complex , forming an area now known as UMass Lowells South Campus.The dedication of several buildings named for each of the schools six presidents was held on June 9 , 1974 . These buildings were built in the style of brutalism .",
      "During these years , in addition to the school presidents , there were a number of important administrators and educators who also played significant roles in the development of the school . Mary McGauvran , a 1939 graduate of Lowell Teachers College , returned to her alma mater In 1957 , going on to hold important positions as director of admissions , assistant dean of women , and director of student affairs . McGauvran was a teacher and a nationally recognized assessment expert with a Ph.D . from Boston University Patricia A . Goler was hired in the Social Sciences department ( later the History Department of Lowell State College ) . She was not only the first female African-American Ph.D . to be hired at Lowell Teachers College , but the first within the Commonwealths public higher education system . Marguerite Gourville was originally hired as director of physical education in 1936 , and quickly distinguished herself as founder of the Modern Dance Club . Gourville , like McGauvran want on to fill many important administrative roles including dean ( 1944 ) and interim president ( 1950 ) .",
      "Merger .",
      "In 1972 , a feasibility study was conducted on merging the school with the nearby Lowell Technological Institute . In 1975 , the schools merged to form the University of Lowell . The name was changed in 1991 to the University of Massachusetts Lowell when the institution joined the University of Massachusetts system . Today , the schools campus is known as the South Campus of UMass Lowell . The legacy of Lowell Normal School lives on in the University of Massachusetts Lowell College of Education .",

      "Florence ( ; ) is a city in Central Italy and the capital city of the Tuscany region . It is the most populated city in Tuscany , with 383,084 inhabitants in 2013 , and over 1,520,000 in its metropolitan area .",
      "Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era . It is considered by many academics to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance , and has been called the Athens of the Middle Ages . Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions . From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy ( established in 1861 ) . The Florentine dialect forms the base of Standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri , Petrarch , Giovanni Boccaccio , Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini .",
      "The city attracts millions of tourists each year , and UNESCO declared the Historic Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982 . The city is noted for its culture , Renaissance art and architecture and monuments . The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries , such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti , and still exerts an influence in the fields of art , culture and politics . Due to Florences artistic and architectural heritage , Forbes has ranked it as one of the most beautiful cities in the world .",
      "Florence plays an important role in Italian fashion , and is ranked in the top 15 fashion capitals of the world by Global Language Monitor ; furthermore , it is a major national economic centre , as well as a tourist and industrial hub . In 2008 the city had the 17th-highest average income in Italy .",
      "History .",
      "Florence originated as a Roman city , and later , after a long period as a flourishing trading and banking medieval commune , it was the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance . It was politically , economically , and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries .",
      "The language spoken in the city during the 14th century came to be accepted as the model for what would become the Italian language . Thanks especially to the works of the Tuscans Dante , Petrarch and Boccaccio , Florentine dialect , above all the local dialects , was adopted as the basis for a national literary language .",
      "Starting from the late Middle Ages , Florentine money\u2014in the form of the gold florin\u2014financed the development of industry all over Europe , from Britain to Bruges , to Lyon and Hungary . Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the Hundred Years War . They similarly financed the papacy , including the construction of their provisional capital of Avignon and , after their return to Rome , the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome .",
      "Florence was home to the Medici , one of European historys most important noble families . Lorenzo de Medici was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century . Two members of the family were popes in the early 16th century : Leo X and Clement VII . Catherine de Medici married King Henry II of France and , after his death in 1559 , reigned as regent in France . Marie de Medici married Henry IV of France and gave birth to the future King Louis XIII . The Medici reigned as Grand Dukes of Tuscany , starting with Cosimo I de Medici in 1569 and ending with the death of Gian Gastone de Medici in 1737 .",
      "Roman origins .",
      "In the 9th\u20138th century BC , the Etruscans formed the small settlement of Fiesole ( Faesulae in Latin ) This was destroyed by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 80 BC , in reprisal for supporting the populares faction in Rome . The present city of Florence was established by Julius Caesar in 59 BC as a settlement for his veteran soldiers and was named originally Fluentia , owing to the fact that it was built between two rivers , which was later changed to Florentia ( flowering ) . It was built in the style of an army camp with the main streets , the cardo and the decumanus , intersecting at the present Piazza della Repubblica . Situated along the Via Cassia , the main route between Rome and the north , and within the fertile valley of the Arno , the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre .",
      "In centuries to come , the city experienced turbulent periods of Ostrogothic rule , during which the city was often troubled by warfare between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines , which may have caused the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people . Peace returned under Lombard rule in the 6th century . Florence was conquered by Charlemagne in 774 and became part of the Duchy of Tuscany , with Lucca as capital . The population began to grow again and commerce prospered . In 854 , Florence and Fiesole were united in one county .",
      "Second millennium .",
      "Margrave Hugo chose Florence as his residency instead of Lucca at about 1000 AD . The Golden Age of Florentine art began around this time . In 1013 , construction began on the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte . The exterior of the church was reworked in Romanesque style between 1059 and 1128 . In 1100 , Florence was a Commune , meaning a city state . The citys primary resource was the Arno river , providing power and access for the industry ( mainly textile industry ) , and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade . Another great source of strength was its industrious merchant community . The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation ( e.g . bills of exchange , double-entry bookkeeping system ) to medieval fairs . This period also saw the eclipse of Florences formerly powerful rival Pisa ( defeated by Genoa in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406 ) , and the exercise of power by the mercantile elite following an anti-aristocratic movement , led by Giano della Bella , that resulted in a set of laws called the Ordinances of Justice ( 1293 ) .",
      "Middle Ages and Renaissance .",
      "Rise of the Medici .",
      "At the height of demographic expansion around 1325 , the urban population may have been as great as 120,000 , and the rural population around the city was probably close to 300,000 . The Black Death of 1348 reduced it by over half , about 25,000 are said to have been supported by the citys wool industry : in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers ( ciompi ) , who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the Revolt of the Ciompi . After their suppression , Florence came under the sway ( 1382\u20131434 ) of the Albizzi family , who became bitter rivals of the Medici .",
      "In the 15th century , Florence was among the largest cities in Europe , with a population of 60,000 , and was considered rich and economically successful . Cosimo de Medici was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes . Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts , his power came from a vast patronage network along with his alliance to the new immigrants , the gente nuova ( new people ) . The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy . Cosimo was succeeded by his son Piero , who was , soon after , succeeded by Cosimos grandson , Lorenzo in 1469 . Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts , commissioning works by Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli . Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence , including Alexander Agricola , Johannes Ghiselin , and Heinrich Isaac . By contemporary Florentines ( and since ) , he was known as Lorenzo the Magnificent ( Lorenzo il Magnifico ) .",
      "Following Lorenzo de Medicis death in 1492 , he was succeeded by his son Piero II . When the French king Charles VIII invaded northern Italy , Piero II chose to resist his army . But when he realised the size of the French army at the gates of Pisa , he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king . These made the Florentines rebel , and they expelled Piero II . With his exile in 1494 , the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government .",
      "Savonarola , Machiavelli , and the Medici Popes .",
      "During this period , the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola had become prior of the San Marco monastery in 1490 . He was famed for his penitential sermons , lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches . He praised the exile of the Medici as the work of God , punishing them for their decadence . He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule . But when Savonarola publicly accused Pope Alexander VI of corruption , he was banned from speaking in public . When he broke this ban , he was excommunicated . The Florentines , tired of his extreme teachings , turned against him and arrested him . He was convicted as a heretic and burned at the stake on the Piazza della Signoria on 23 May 1498 .",
      "A second individual of unusually acute insight was Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli , whose prescriptions for Florences regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimisation of political expediency and even malpractice . In other words , Machiavelli was a political thinker , perhaps most renowned for his political handbook , titled The Prince , which is about ruling and the exercise of power . Commissioned by the Medici , Machiavelli also wrote the Florentine Histories , the history of the city . Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a republic on 16 May 1527 . Restored twice with the support of both Emperor Charles V and Pope Clement VII ( Giulio de Medici ) , the Medici in 1532 became hereditary dukes of Florence , and in 1569 Grand Dukes of Tuscany , ruling for two centuries . In all Tuscany , only the Republic of Lucca ( later a Duchy ) and the Principality of Piombino were independent from Florence .",
      "18th and 19th centuries .",
      "The extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of Francis Stephen , duke of Lorraine and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria , led to Tuscanys temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown . It became a secundogeniture of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty , who were deposed for the House of Bourbon-Parma in 1801 . From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the Napoleonic client state Kingdom of Etruria . The Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by France . Florence was the prefecture of the French d\u00e9partement of Arno from 1808 to the fall of Napoleon in 1814 . The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the Congress of Vienna but finally deposed in 1859 . Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 .",
      "Florence replaced Turin as Italys capital in 1865 and , in an effort to modernise the city , the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses . The Piazza ( first renamed Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II , then Piazza della Repubblica , the present name ) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end . This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city . A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today .",
      "The countrys second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later , after the withdrawal of the French troops allowed the capture of Rome .",
      "20th century .",
      "During World War II the city experienced a year-long German occupation ( 1943\u20131944 ) being part of the Italian Social Republic . Hitler declared it an open city on 3 July 1944 as troops of the British 8th Army closed in . In early August , the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the Arno linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city , making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross . However , at the last moment Charles Steinhauslin , at the time consul of 26 countries in Florence , convinced the German general in Italy that the Ponte Vecchio was not to be destroyed due to its historical value . Instead , an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge , including part of the Corridoio Vasariano , was destroyed using mines . Since then the bridges have been restored to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible , but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design . Shortly before leaving Florence , as they knew that they would soon have to retreat , the Germans executed many freedom fighters and political opponents publicly , in streets and squares including the Piazza Santo Spirito .",
      "Florence was liberated by New Zealand , South African and British troops on 4 August 1944 alongside partisans from the Tuscan Committee of National Liberation ( CTLN ) . The Allied soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city ( Americans about south of the city , British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno ) .",
      "At the end of World War II in May 1945 , the US Armys Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence , Italy . The first American University for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics in Florence , Italy . Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the University during its four one-month sessions ( see G . I . American Universities ) .",
      "In November 1966 , the Arno flooded parts of the centre , damaging many art treasures . Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point .",
      "Geography .",
      "Florence lies in a basin formed by the hills of Careggi , Fiesole , Settignano , Arcetri , Poggio Imperiale and Bellosguardo ( Florence ) . The Arno river , three other minor rivers ( Mugnone , Ema and Greve ) and some streams flow through it .",
      "Climate .",
      "Florence has a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) , tending to Mediterranean ( Csa ) . It has hot summers with moderate or light rainfall and cool , damp winters . As Florence lacks a prevailing wind , summer temperatures are higher than along the coast . Rainfall in summer is convectional , while relief rainfall dominates in the winter . Snow flurries occur almost every year , but often result in no accumulation . The highest officially recorded temperature was on 26 July 1983 and the lowest was on 12 January 1985 .",
      "Government .",
      "The legislative body of the municipality is the City Council ( Consiglio Comunale ) , which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system , at the same time as the mayoral elections . The executive body is the City Committee ( Giunta Comunale ) , composed of 7 assessors , nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor . The current mayor of Florence is Dario Nardella .",
      "The municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs ( Quartieri ) . Each borough is governed by a Council ( Consiglio ) and a President , elected at the same time as the city mayor . The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution ( art . 114 ) . The boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics ( environment , construction , public health , local markets ) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council ; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding in order to finance local activities . The boroughs are :",
      "- Q1 \u2013 Centro storico ( Historic Centre ) ; population : 67,170 ;",
      "- Q2 \u2013 Campo di Marte ; population : 88,588 ;",

      "- Q4 \u2013 Isolotto-Legnaia ; population : 66,636 ;",
      "- Q5 \u2013 Rifredi ; population : 103,761 .",
      "All of the five boroughs are governed by the Democratic Party .",
      "The former Italian Prime Minister ( 2014\u20132016 ) , Matteo Renzi , served as mayor from 2009 to 2014 .",
      "Main sights .",
      "Florence is known as the cradle of the Renaissance ( la culla del Rinascimento ) for its monuments , churches , and buildings . The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city , Santa Maria del Fiore , known as The Duomo , whose dome was built by Filippo Brunelleschi . The nearby Campanile ( partly designed by Giotto ) and the Baptistery buildings are also highlights . The dome , 600 years after its completion , is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world . In 1982 , the historic centre of Florence ( Italian : centro storico di Firenze ) was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO . The centre of the city is contained in medieval walls that were built in the 14th century to defend the city . At the heart of the city , in Piazza della Signoria , is Bartolomeo Ammannatis Fountain of Neptune ( 1563\u20131565 ) , which is a masterpiece of marble sculpture at the terminus of a still functioning Roman aqueduct .",
      "The layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era , where it was designed as a garrison settlement . Nevertheless , the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance . Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city , traces of medieval , Baroque , Neoclassical and modern architecture can be found . The Palazzo Vecchio as well as the Duomo , or the citys Cathedral , are the two buildings which dominate Florences skyline .",
      "The river Arno , which cuts through the old part of the city , is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there . Historically , the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno \u2013 which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce , and destroying it by flood .",
      "One of the bridges in particular stands out \u2013 the Ponte Vecchio ( Old Bridge ) , whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges , held up by stilts . The bridge also carries Vasaris elevated corridor linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence ( Palazzo Pitti ) . Although the original bridge was constructed by the Etruscans , the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century . It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War II intact . It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental arches , that is , arches less than a semicircle , to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed ( being in this much more successful than the Roman Alcon\u00e9tar Bridge ) .",
      "The church of San Lorenzo contains the Medici Chapel , the mausoleum of the Medici family\u2014the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th century . Nearby is the Uffizi Gallery , one of the finest art museums in the world \u2013 founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family .",
      "The Uffizi is located at the corner of Piazza della Signoria , a site important for being the centre of Florences civil life and government for centuries . The Palazzo della Signoria facing it is still home of the municipal government . Many significant episodes in the history of art and political changes were staged here , such as :",
      "- In 1301 , Dante Alighieri was sent into exile from here ( commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi ) .",
      "- On 26 April 1478 , Jacopo de Pazzi and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as La congiura dei Pazzi ( The Pazzi conspiracy ) , murdering Giuliano di Piero de Medici and wounding his brother Lorenzo . All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace .",
      "- In 1497 , it was the location of the Bonfire of the Vanities instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher Girolamo Savonarola",

Originally called the Palazzo della Signoria , after the Signoria of Florence , the ruling body of the Republic of Florence , it was also given several other names : Palazzo del Popolo , Palazzo dei Priori , and Palazzo Ducale , in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history . The building acquired its current name when the Medici dukes residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti . It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the Corridoio Vasariano .",
      "Palazzo Medici Riccardi , designed by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo for Cosimo il Vecchio , of the Medici family , is another major edifice , and was built between 1445 and 1460 . It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar . Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence and hosts museums and the Riccardiana Library . The Palazzo Strozzi , an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone , was inspired by the Palazzo Medici , but with more harmonious proportions . Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show ( founded as the Biennale dellAntiquariato in 1959 ) , fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events .

      "Much like the rest of Italy most of the people in Florence are Roman Catholic , with more than 90% of the population belonging to the Archdiocese of Florence .",
      "Economy .",
      "Tourism is , by far , the most important of all industries and most of the Florentine economy relies on the money generated by international arrivals and students studying in the city . The value tourism to the city totalled some \u20ac2.5 billion in 2015 and the number of visitors had increased by 5.5% from the previous year .",
      "In 2013 , Florence was listed as the second best world city by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler .",
      "Manufacturing and commerce , however , still remain highly important . Florence is also Italys 17th richest city in terms of average workers earnings , with the figure being \u20ac23,265 ( the overall citys income is \u20ac6,531,204,473 ) , coming after Mantua , yet surpassing Bolzano .",
      "Industry , commerce and services .",
      "Florence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy , where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods , from furniture , rubber goods , chemicals , and food . However , traditional and local products , such as antiques , handicrafts , glassware , leatherwork , art reproductions , jewellery , souvenirs , elaborate metal and iron-work , shoes , accessories and high fashion clothes also dominate a fair sector of Florences economy . The citys income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests , such as annual fairs , theatrical and lyrical productions , art exhibitions , festivals and fashion shows , such as the Calcio Fiorentino . Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income . In Nuovo Pignone , numerous factories are still present , and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant . The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the Third Italy in the 1990s , due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile ( especially the Vespa ) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs . Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto due to high profits and productivity .",
      "In the fourth quarter of 2015 , manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2% . Leading sectors included mechanical engineering , fashion , pharmaceutics , food and wine . During 2015 , permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent , boosted by nationwide tax break .",
      "Tourism .",
      "Tourism is the most significant industry in central Florence . From April to October , tourists outnumber local population . Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia museums are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella , both of which charge for entry . Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting . In 2010 , readers of Travel + Leisure magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination . In 2015 , Cond\u00e9 Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe .",
      "Studies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe .",
      "Florence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art ( in proportion to its size ) in the world . Thus , cultural tourism is particularly strong , with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93 million tickets in 2014 . The citys convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions , conferences , meetings , social forums , concerts and other events all year .",
      "In 2016 , Florence had 20,588 hotel rooms in 570 facilities . International visitors use 75% of the rooms ; some 18% of those were from the U.S . In 2014 , the city had 8.5 million overnight stays . A Euromonitor report indicates that in 2015 the city ranked as the worlds 36th most visited in the world , with over 4.95 million arrivals for the year .",
      "Tourism brings revenue to Florence , but also creates certain problems . The Ponte Vecchio , The San Lorenzo Market and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets . The province of Florence receives roughly 13 million visitors per year and in peak seasons , popular locations may become overcrowded as a result . In 2015 , Mayor Dario Nardella expressed concern over visitors who arrive on buses , stay only a few hours , spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding . No museum visit , just a photo from the square , the bus back and then on to Venice.. . We don\u2019t want tourists like that , he said .",
      "Some tourists are less than respectful of the citys cultural heritage , according to Nardella . In June 2017 , he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots . While he values the benefits of tourism , he claims that there has been an increase among those who sit down on church steps , eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them , he explained . To boost the sale of traditional foods , the mayor had introduced legislation ( enacted in 2016 ) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonalds application to open a location in the Piazza del Duomo .",
      "Food and wine production .",
      "Food and wine have long been an important staple of the economy . The Chianti region is just south of the city , and its Sangiovese grapes figure prominently not only in its Chianti Classico wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends . Within to the west is the Carmignano area , also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds . The celebrated Chianti Rufina district , geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region , is also few kilometres east of Florence . More recently , the Bolgheri region ( about southwest of Florence ) has become celebrated for its Super Tuscan reds such as Sassicaia and Ornellaia .",
      "Culture .",
      "Art .",
      "Florence was the birthplace of High Renaissance art , which lasted from 1450 to 1527 . While Medieval art focused on basic story telling of the Bible , Renaissance art focused on naturalism and human emotion . Medieval art was abstract , formulaic , and largely produced by monks whereas Renaissance art was rational , mathematical , individualistic , consisted of linear perspective and shading ( Chiaroscuro ) and produced by specialists ( Leonardo da Vinci , Donatello , Michelangelo , and Raphael ) . Religion was important , but with this new age came the humanization of religious figures in art , such as Expulsion from the Garden of Eden , Ecce Homo ( Bosch , 1470s ) , and Madonna Della Seggiola ; People of this age began to understand themselves as human beings , which reflected in art . The Renaissance marked the rebirth of classical values in art and society as people studied the ancient masters of the Greco-Roman world ; Art became focused on realism as opposed to idealism .",
      "Cimabue and Giotto , the fathers of Italian painting , lived in Florence as well as Arnolfo and Andrea Pisano , renewers of architecture and sculpture ; Brunelleschi , Donatello and Masaccio , forefathers of the Renaissance , Ghiberti and the Della Robbias , Filippo Lippi and Angelico ; Botticelli , Paolo Uccello and the universal genius of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo .",
      "Their works , together with those of many other generations of artists , are gathered in the several museums of the town : the Uffizi Gallery , the Palatina gallery with the paintings of the Golden Ages , the Bargello with the sculptures of the Renaissance , the museum of San Marco with Fra Angelicos works , the Academy , the chapels of the Medicis Buonarrotis house with the sculptures of Michelangelo , the following museums : Bardini , Horne , Stibbert , Romano , Corsini , The Gallery of Modern Art , the Museo dellOpera del Duomo , the museum of Silverware and the museum of Precious Stones .",
      "Several monuments are located in Florence : the Florence Baptistery with its mosaics ; the cathedral with its sculptures , the medieval churches with bands of frescoes ; public as well as private palaces : Palazzo Vecchio , Palazzo Pitti , Palazzo Medici Riccardi , Palazzo Davanzati ; monasteries , cloisters , refectories ; the Certosa . In the archaeological museum includes documents of Etruscan civilisation . In fact the city is so rich in art that some first time visitors experience the Stendhal syndrome as they encounter its art for the first time .",
      "Florentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi ( 1377\u20131466 ) and Leon Battista Alberti ( 1404\u20131472 ) were among the fathers of both Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture .",
      "The cathedral , topped by Brunelleschis dome , dominates the Florentine skyline . The Florentines decided to start building it \u2013 late in the 13th century , without a design for the dome . The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time , and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times \u2013 the Pantheon in Rome , and Hagia Sophia in Constantinople . The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world . In front of it is the medieval Baptistery . The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance . In recent years , most of the important works of art from the two buildings \u2013 and from the nearby Giottos Campanile , have been removed and replaced by copies . The originals are now housed in the Museum dellOpera del Duomo , just to the east of the cathedral .",
      "Florence has large numbers of art-filled churches , such as San Miniato al Monte , San Lorenzo , Santa Maria Novella , Santa Trinita , Santa Maria del Carmine , Santa Croce , Santo Spirito , the Annunziata , Ognissanti and numerous others .",
      "Artists associated with Florence range from Arnolfo di Cambio and Cimabue to Giotto , Nanni di Banco , and Paolo Uccello ; through Lorenzo Ghiberti , and Donatello and Massaccio and the della Robbia family ; through Fra Angelico and Botticelli and Piero della Francesca , and on to Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci . Others include Benvenuto Cellini , Andrea del Sarto , Benozzo Gozzoli , Domenico Ghirlandaio , Filippo Lippi , Bernardo Buontalenti , Orcagna , Pollaiuolo , Filippino Lippi , Verrocchio , Bronzino , Desiderio da Settignano , Michelozzo , the Rossellis , the Sangallos , and Pontormo . Artists from other regions who worked in Florence include Raphael , Andrea Pisano , Giambologna , Il Sodoma and Peter Paul Rubens .",
      "Picture galleries in Florence include the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace . Two superb collections of sculpture are in the Bargello and the Museum of the Works of the Duomo . They are filled with the creations of Donatello , Verrochio , Desiderio da Settignano , Michelangelo and others . The Galleria dellAccademia has Michelangelos David \u2013 perhaps the best-known work of art anywhere , plus the unfinished statues of the slaves Michelangelo created for the tomb of Pope Julius II . Other sights include the medieval city hall , the Palazzo della Signoria ( also known as the Palazzo Vecchio ) , the Archeological Museum , the Museum of the History of Science , the Garden of Archimedes , the Palazzo Davanzatti , the Stibbert Museum , St . Marks , the Medici Chapels , the Museum of the Works of Santa Croce , the Museum of the Cloister of Santa Maria Novella , the Zoological Museum ( La Specola ) , the Bardini , and the Museo Horne . There is also a collection of works by the modern sculptor , Marino Marini , in a museum named after him . The Strozzi Palace is the site of special exhibits .",
      "Language .",
      "Florentine ( fiorentino ) , spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs , is a Tuscan dialect and the immediate parent language to modern Italian .",
      "Although its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian , differences do exist . The Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo ( Dictionary of Modern Florentine ) reveals lexical distinctions from all walks of life . Florentines have a highly recognisable accent in phonetic terms due to the so-called gorgia toscana ) : hard c between two vowels is pronounced as a fricative similar to an English h , so that dico I say is phonetically , i cani the dogs is . Similarly , t between vowels is pronounced as in English thin , and p in the same position is the bilabial fricative . Other traits include using a form of the subjunctive mood last commonly used in medieval times , a frequent usage in everyday speech of the modern subjunctive , and a shortened pronunciation of the definite article , instead of il , causing doubling of the consonant that follows , so that il cane the dog , for example , is pronounced .",
      "Dante , Petrarch , and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time .",
      "Literature .",
      "Despite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages , writers such as Dante Alighieri and many others used their own language , the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin , in composing their greatest works . The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century . Florences literature fully blossomed in the 14th century , when not only Dante with his Divine Comedy ( 1306\u20131321 ) and Petrarch , but also poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Lapo Gianni composed their most important works . Dantes masterpiece is the Divine Comedy , which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell , Purgatory and finally Heaven , during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before . He is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil , whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell . Later on he is joined by Beatrice , who guides him through Heaven .",
      "In the 14th century , Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio led the literary scene in Florence after Dantes death in 1321 . Petrarch was an all-rounder writer , author and poet , but was particularly known for his Canzoniere , or the Book of Songs , where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura . His style of writing has since become known as Petrarchism . Boccaccio was better known for his Decameron , a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague , known as the Black Death , when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion , and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition . All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas .",
      "In the 16th century , during the Renaissance , Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli , whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land , detailed in The Prince , spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries . These principles became known as Machiavellianism .",
      "Music .",
      "Florence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture . The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence . During the Renaissance , there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music : state , corporate , church , and private . It was here that the Florentine Camerata convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result\u2014in other words , the first operas , setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form , but for later developments of separate classical forms such as the symphony and concerto . After the year 1600 , Italian trends prevailed across Europe , by 1750 it was the primary musical language . The genre of the Madrigal , born in Italy , gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere . Several Italian cities were larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested . Florence , was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation , including the beginning and flourishing of opera .",
      "Opera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when Jacobo Peris Dafne an opera in the style of monody , was premiered . Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe . Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time . At the beginning of the 17th century , two practices for writing music were devised , one the first practice or Stile Antico/Prima Prattica the other the Stile Moderno/Seconda Prattica . The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time .",
      "The piano was invented in Florence in 1709 by Bartolomeo Cristofori .",
      "Composers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi ( 1550 \u2013 after 1608 ) , Giulio Caccini ( 1551\u20131618 ) and Mike Francis ( 1961\u20132009 ) . Giulio Caccinis book Le Nuove Musiche was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time . The book specified a new term , in use by the 1630s , called monody which indicated the combination of voice and basso continuo and connoted a practice of stating text in a free , lyrical , yet speech-like manner . This would occur while an instrument , usually a keyboard type such as harpsichord , played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line .",
      "Cinema .",
      "Florence has been a setting for numerous works of fiction and movies , including the novels and associated films , such as Light in the Piazza , The Girl Who Couldnt Say No , Calmi Cuori Appassionati , Hannibal , A Room with a View , Tea with Mussolini , Virgin Territory and Inferno . The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses , such as Roberto Benigni , Leonardo Pieraccioni and Vittoria Puccini .",

      "Cuisine .",
      "Florentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant eating rather than rarefied high cooking . The majority of dishes are based on meat . The whole animal was traditionally eaten ; tripe ( trippa ) and stomach ( lampredotto ) were once regularly on the menu and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city . Antipasti include crostini toscani , sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based p\u00e2t\u00e9 , and sliced meats ( mainly prosciutto and salame , often served with melon when in season ) . The typically saltless Tuscan bread , obtained with natural levain frequently features in Florentine courses , especially in its soups , ribollita and pappa al pomodoro , or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called panzanella that is served in summer . The bistecca alla fiorentina is a large ( the customary size should weigh around ) \u2013 the date steak \u2013 T-bone steak of Chianina beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version , the tagliata , sliced rare beef served on a bed of arugula , often with slices of Parmesan cheese on top . Most of these courses are generally served with local olive oil , also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation . Among the desserts , schiacciata alla fiorentina , a white flatbread cake , is one of the most popular ; it is a very soft cake , prepared with extremely simple ingredients , typical of Florentine cuisine , and is especially eaten at Carnival .",

      "Florence has been an important scientific centre for centuries , notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci .",
      "Florentines were one of the driving forces behind the Age of Discovery . Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East . It was a map drawn by the Florentine Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli , a student of Brunelleschi , that Christopher Columbus used to sell his enterprise to the Spanish monarchs , and which he used on his first voyage . Mercators Projection is a refined version of Toscanellis , taking the Americas into account .",
      "Galileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics , ballistics , astronomy , anatomy , and other scientific disciplines . Pico della Mirandola , Leonardo Bruni , Machiavelli , and many others laid the groundwork for modern scientific understanding .",
      "Fashion .",
      "By the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe . Many of the rich families in Renaissance Florence were major purchasers of locally produced fine clothing , and the specialists of fashion in the economy and culture of Florence during that period is often underestimated . Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern ( post World War Two ) fashion industry in Italy . The Florentine soir\u00e9es of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention . Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company Salvatore Ferragamo since 1928 . Gucci , Roberto Cavalli , and Emilio Pucci are also headquartered in Florence .

      "Scoppio del Carro .",
      "The Scoppio del Carro ( Explosion of the Cart ) is a celebration of the First Crusade . During the day of Easter , a cart , which the Florentines call the Brindellone and which is led by four white oxen , is taken to the Piazza del Duomo between the Baptistery of St . John the Baptist ( Battistero di San Giovanni ) and the Florence Cathedral ( Santa Maria del Fiore ) . The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church . Near the cart there is a model of a dove , which , according to legend , is a symbol of good luck for the city : at the end of the Easter mass , the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart .",
      "Calcio Storico .",
      "Calcio Storico Fiorentino ( Historic Florentine Football ) , sometimes called Calcio in costume , is a traditional sport , regarded as a forerunner of soccer , though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby . The event originates from the Middle Ages , when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes . The most important match was played on 17 February 1530 , during the siege of Florence . That day Papal troops besieged the city while the Florentines , with contempt of the enemies , decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation . The game is played in the Piazza di Santa Croce . A temporary arena is constructed , with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field . A series of matches are held between four teams representing each quartiere ( quarter ) of Florence during late June and early July . There are four teams : Azzurri ( light blue ) , Bianchi ( white ) , Rossi ( red ) and Verdi ( green ) . The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce , Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito , Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella .",

      "Penrhyn Castle ( ) is a country house in Llandygai , Bangor , Gwynedd , North Wales , in the form of a Norman castle . It was originally a medieval fortified manor house , founded by Ednyfed Fychan . In 1438 , Ioan ap Gruffudd was granted a licence to crenellate and he founded the stone castle and added a tower house . Samuel Wyatt reconstructed the property in the 1780s .",
      "The present building was built between about 1822 and 1837 to designs by Thomas Hopper on behalf of its owner , who expanded and transformed the building beyond recognition . The owner of the castle had many slaves , and was compensated for being deprived of them after the abolition of slavery with about the same sum as construction of the castle had cost .",
      "Later history .",
      "George Hay Dawkins-Pennant ( 1764\u20131840 ) had inherited the Penrhyn Estate on the death of his second cousin , The 1st Baron Penrhyn ( first creation ; 1737\u20131808 ) , who had made his fortune from sugar plantations and slaves in Jamaica and local slate quarries . The eldest of Georges two daughters , Juliana , married an aristocratic Grenadier Guard , Edward Gordon Douglas ( 1800\u20131886 ) , who , on inheriting the estate on Georges death in 1840 , adopted the hyphenated surname of Douglas-Pennant . Edward , the grandson of The 14th Earl of Morton , was created The 1st Baron Penrhyn ( second creation ) in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1866 .",
      "After the 1822\u20131837 rebuild a spiral staircase remains from the original structure , and a vaulted basement and other masonry were incorporated into the new structure .",
      "The cost of the construction of this vast castle is disputed , and very difficult to work out accurately , as much of the timber came from the familys own forestry , and much of the labour was acquired from within their own workforce at the slate quarry . It cost the Pennant family an estimated \u00a3150,000 . This is the current equivalent to about \u00a349,500,000 .",
      "Penrhyn is one of the most admired of the numerous mock castles built in the United Kingdom in the 19th century ; Christopher Hussey called it , the outstanding instance of Norman revival . The castle is a picturesque composition that stretches over 600 feet from a tall donjon containing family rooms , through the main block built around the earlier house , to the service wing and the stables .",
      "It is built in a sombre style which allows it to possess something of the medieval fortress air despite the ground-level drawing room windows . Hopper designed all the principal interiors in a rich but restrained Norman style , with much fine plasterwork and wood and stone carving . The castle also has some specially designed Norman-style furniture , including a one-ton slate bed made for Queen Victoria when she visited in 1859 .",
      "The 4th Baron Penrhyn died in June 1949 , and the castle and estate passed to his niece , Lady Janet Pelham , who , on inheritance , adopted the surname of Douglas-Pennant . In 1951 , the castle and 40,000 acres ( 160 km ) of land were accepted by the treasury in lieu of death duties from Lady Janet . It now belongs to the National Trust and is open to the public . The site received 109,395 visitors in 2017 .",
      "Slavery .",
      "Dawkins-Pennant , an opponent of the emancipation of slaves , was after the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 compensated for being deprived of 764 slaves , being paid \u00a314,683 17s 2d\u2014about the cost of building the castle .",
      "In 2020 the National Trust was working on a plan to include coverage about the former owners of its properties who had links to colonialism and slavery . Penrhyn Castle was built using profits made by a family that used hundreds of enslaved people . The castle today displays information about Richard Pennant , who by 1805 owned nearly 1,000 enslaved people across his four plantations in Jamaica .",

In the nineteenth century , Penrhyn Castle was the home of the Pennant family ( from 1840 , the Douglas-Pennants ) , owners of the Penrhyn slate quarry at Bethesda . The quarry was closely associated with the development of industrial narrow-gauge railways , and in particular the Penrhyn Quarry Railway ( PQR ) , one of the earliest industrial railways in the world . The PQR ran close to Penrhyn Castle , and when the castle was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1951 a small museum of industrial railway relics was created in the stable block . The first locomotive donated to the museum was Charles , one of the three remaining steam locomotives working on the PQR .

      "Gleaston Castle is a medieval building in a valley about north-east of the village of Gleaston . The village lies between the towns of Ulverston and Barrow-in-Furness in the Furness peninsula , Cumbria , England . Gleaston Castle has a quadrilateral plan , with a tower at each corner . The largest of these , the north-west tower , probably housed a hall .",
      "The castle was most likely built for John Harington , 1st Baron Harington in the 14th century , replacing nearby Aldingham Motte . Gleaston Castle descended through the Harrington family until 1458 when it passed to William Bonville through marriage and was subsequently abandoned . The castle passed to the Grey family until Henry Grey , 1st Duke of Suffolk was executed for treason in 1554 . As a result , Gleaston Castle became royal property before it was bought by the Preston family in the 17th century , and then passed to the Cavendish family .",
      "As the castle was disused from the mid-15th century it fell into dilapidation , and antiquarian depictions from the 18th century show Gleaston in a state of ruin . Though it is not open to the public , it has been the subject of historical and archaeological investigation in the 20th and 21st centuries .",
      "History .",
      "From the 12th century the manor of Muchland was administered from Aldingham Castle . Muchland became known as Aldingham manor and in 1291 it came into the ownership of the Harrington family . In the 14th century , the Scots attacked the Furness peninsula during the Scottish Wars of Independence ; around the same time coastal erosion threatened Aldingham Motte . These factors may have led to the Harrington family abandoning Aldingham and establishing the administrative centre of the manor at the newly built Gleaston Castle , though the construction work could have been the result of their growing social status , and they may have needed more room for a greater number of servants .",
      "The castle was probably built for John Harington , 1st Baron Harington ( b . 1281\u2013d . 1347 ) . Gleaston Castle is first mentioned in 1389 , although John Harington , 2nd Baron Harington is said to have died there in 1363 . In 1415 John Harington was granted a papal indult for a private chapel and a portable altar for mass . It is likely , however , that the castle would have had its own chapel before this date .",
      "The Harington family owned Gleaston Castle until William Harington , 5th Baron Harington died in 1458 . The castle and barony then passed to William Bonville , 6th Baron Harington through marriage . He died in 1460 and the castle passed to Thomas Grey , 1st Marquess of Dorset , again through marriage . It is likely that around this time Gleaston Castle was abandoned . In 1540 , the antiquarian John Leland noted there is a ruine and waulles of a castell in Lancaster-shire cawlyd Gleston Castell sometyme longinge to Lord Harrington now to the Marquis of Dorset , and other antiquarians provided descriptions of the site .",
      "When Henry Grey , 1st Duke of Suffolk was executed for treason in 1554 his property was taken over by the monarch . In 1671 Thomas Preston , 3rd Baronet Preston bought Aldingham manor which included Gleaston Castle . The property descended through the Prestons to the Cavendish family . The castle is now part of an active farm which dates from the 19th century . The farm buildings incorporate some of the fabric of the castle . The Prestons owned the castle until 1922 when it was sold to the current family of owners . According to a 1905 document from the Cumbria Archive Centre up to four human skeletons were discovered at the castle in the 19th century when the farm buildings were built .",
      "An engraving by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck from 1727 is one of the earliest depictions of the castle , with later depictions from antiquarian William Close ( 1805 ) , artist William Green ( 1809 ) , and Edwin Waugh ( 1860 ) . The Buck brother\u2019s engraving showed the castle in a state of ruin , and Waughs depiction in particular shows that from the mid-19th century the castle has remained in a similar state of ruin until the present .",
      "Preservation and investigation .",
      "Gleaston Castle is now a Grade I listed ruin , and a scheduled monument . The ruins can be viewed from the roadside , but it is unsafe to enter the castle due to its state of repair . , the castle is on Historic Englands Heritage At Risk register and its condition is described as very bad and deteriorating . Since the late 20th century there have been efforts to preserve the site : in 1998 the Lancaster University Archaeological Unit conducted an assessment of the standing building for further research and whether it would be possible to open the building to the public , but Historic England notes that no agreement was reached regarding a scheme of consolidation",
      "The castles precarious condition meant that the structure was not fully recorded until 2015 , when the Morecambe Bay Partnership with funding from the Castle Studies Trust commissioned Greenlane Archaeology to carry out an aerial survey of the site . As well as producing a visual record of the castle from which elevations and plans could be derived , it identified features within the castle which could be buildings which no longer survive . In 2016 the University of Central Lancashire undertook a geophysical survey , using it as training for archaeology students and volunteers . The survey indicated there was formerly a garden to the north of the castle , and timber structures within the castle .",
      "Architecture and layout .",
      "Gleaston Castle was abandoned , perhaps around a century after its construction . As a result , the standing remains are an example of 14th-century architecture which has not been adapted by later occupation . The remains consist largely of limestone , which was quarried locally , while sandstone was used for doors and windows . The sandstone may have been recovered from a beach from the castle as there is no local source of sandstone . This method of using red sandstone for architectural details can also be seen at Piel Castle near Barrow-in-Furness .",
      "The castle was a walled enclosure long north and south , wide at the south end and wide at the north end . It had four corner towers , dressed with red sandstone . The north-west tower measures and is tall at its highest point . It survives as three portions of standing masonry . The ground slopes , and is higher at the north end than the south . The south-west tower measures , and the four-storey tall tower has a large vertical crack in the west wall . The south-east tower measures and survives to a height of . The north-east tower is mostly collapsed , with earthworks , though some of it may survive in the modern farm buildings .",
      "The western curtain wall is thick , and in parts is tall . It has a ruined bastion midway between the north-west and south-west towers . To the east the wall has been partly incorporated into the modern farm buildings , preserving some of the masonry to a height of while in the north and south the wall no longer survives above ground .",
      "Landscape .",
      "Gleaston Castle is about northwest of Gleaston village in the Furness Peninsula . John Harrington was given a licence to create a park in Aldingham manor and , while its location is uncertain , it may have been east of the castle . It is likely that the manor\u2019s mill was also close to the castle , allowing the Harrington family to control an important local economic resource . According to Greenlane Archaeology , establishing how the castle related to the wider landscape has been identified as a future research priority ."

      "Andrzej Panufnik",
      "Sir Andrzej Panufnik ( 24 September 1914 \u2013 27 October 1991 ) was a Polish composer and conductor . He became established as one of the leading Polish composers , and as a conductor he was instrumental in the re-establishment of the Warsaw Philharmonic orchestra after World War II . After his increasing frustration with the extra-musical demands made on him by the countrys regime , he defected to the United Kingdom in 1954 , and took up British citizenship . In 1957 , he became chief conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , a post he relinquished after two years to devote all his time to composition .",
      "Biography .",
      "Childhood and studies .",
      "Panufnik was born in Warsaw , the second son of a violinist mother and an amateur ( but renowned ) violin-maker father . From an early age he was torn between an interest in music and a fascination with the mechanics of aeroplanes . His grandmother gave him piano lessons , but although he showed talent his studies were erratic . As a schoolboy he composed some successful popular tunes , but his father did not approve of his sons pursuing a musical career . Eventually his father relented , permitting the boy to study music provided he matriculated . By this time , Panufnik was too old to take the piano entrance examination for the Warsaw Conservatory , but succeeded in gaining admission as a percussion student . He soon left the percussion class to concentrate on studying composition and conducting ; he worked hard and completed the course in much less time than normal .",
      "After graduating with distinction in 1936 , his plans to travel to Vienna to study conducting for a year under Felix Weingartner were delayed by his being called up for National Service . Panufnik recalled how , on the night before his medical , he heard the national Polish medieval chant Bogurodzica on the wireless . This entirely captivated him , and he sat up late into the night drinking copious quantities of black coffee . The result of this was that he failed his medical examination and was excused from military duties . Instead he used the years hiatus earning money and reputation composing film music .",
      "Panufnik travelled to Vienna in 1937 for his studies with Weingartner . He also fulfilled his intention of studying music by the composers of the Second Viennese School , but while he applauded Arnold Schoenbergs imposition of constraints to give artistic unity to a composition , dodecaphonic music did not appeal to him . Panufnik returned to Poland before the end of his planned year-long stay , leaving shortly after the Anschluss when the political situation caused Weingartner to be removed from the Academy .",
      "Panufnik also lived for some months in Paris and London , where he studied privately and composed his first symphony . He met Weingartner again in London , and the older conductor urged him to stay in England to avoid the consequences of the worsening international situation . Panufnik was determined , however , to return to Poland .",
      "Panufniks war .",
      "During the German occupation of Warsaw during World War II Panufnik formed a piano duo with his friend and fellow composer Witold Lutos\u0142awski , and they performed in caf\u00e9s in Warsaw . This was the only way in which Poles could legitimately hear live music , as arranging concerts was impossible because the occupying forces had banned organised gatherings . Panufnik also composed some illegal Songs of Underground Resistance , especially Warsaw Children which became popular among the defiant Polish community . During this period he composed a Tragic Overture and a second symphony . Later , Panufnik was able to conduct a couple of charity concerts , at one of which his Tragic Overture was first performed . He fled from Warsaw with his ailing mother , leaving all his music behind in his apartment , just before the Warsaw uprising in 1944 . When Panufnik returned to the ruins of the city in the spring of 1945 , to bury his brothers body and recover his own manuscripts , he discovered that despite having survived the widespread destruction , all of his scores had been discarded onto a bonfire by a stranger who had taken over his rooms .",
      "Socialist realism .",
      "After World War II , Panufnik moved to Krak\u00f3w where he found work composing film music for the Army Film Unit . Some of this inevitably was for propaganda films ; Panufnik later recounted how for one film , The Electrification of the Villages , the director was unable to find a house without a supply of electricity , and had to demolish pylons and remove infrastructure to film it being built . Panufnik accepted the post of Principal Conductor with the Krak\u00f3w Philharmonic Orchestra . He reconstructed some of his music that had been lost , starting with the Tragic Overture which was still fresh in his mind . Encouraged by this he also reconstructed his Piano Trio and Polish Peasant Songs . However , his first symphony did not prove so easy and , disappointed with the result , Panufnik decided that he would thereafter concentrate on composing new works .",
      "Appointed Music Director of the defunct Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra , traditionally Polands leading orchestra , Panufnik set about engaging musicians and finding premises . When bureaucratic obstacles made the reconstitution of the orchestra difficult ( for example , the lack of available living accommodation for the musicians ) he resigned in protest . At this time he also fulfilled conducting engagements abroad , including guest conductor with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra . He was instructed to include his Tragic Overture as a reminder to Germany of their recent actions in Warsaw .",
      "Around this time he started composing again , writing his Circle of Fifths for piano ( later published as Twelve Miniature Studies ) . His Lullaby for string orchestra and two harps was inspired by the combination of the River Thames and the night sky , when he saw dark clouds drifting across a brilliant full moon , as viewed from Waterloo Bridge , while he was visiting London . In its use of quarter tones and dense textures this broke new ground , both for Panufnik and for Polish music . Panufnik also composed a Sinfonia Rustica , deciding to give it a name rather than the designation Symphony No . 1 out of feeling for his two lost works in the genre .",
      "Panufnik became Vice-President of the newly constituted ( ZKP\u2014Zwi\u0105zek Kompozytor\u00f3w Polskich ) , accepting the post after being urged to do so by his colleagues . However , in this capacity he found himself manoeuvred into positions which he did not support , at conferences whose nature was political rather than musical . At one of these conferences he met Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly who privately expressed a similar feeling of artistic helplessness to Panufniks . He also encountered composers such as the English Alan Bush , who were sympathetic to the aims of Stalinist Socialism , and other composers on the political far-left such as Benjamin Frankel .",
      "Adding to Panufniks discomfiture , in the post-war period the government became increasingly interventionist in the arts . As a consequence of events in the Soviet Union , particularly the Zhdanov decree in 1948 , it was dictated that composers should follow Soviet Realism , and that musical compositions , like all works of art , should reflect the realities of Socialist Life . Panufnik later mused on the nebulous nature of Soviet Realism , quoting a Polish joke of the time that it was like a mosquito : everyone knew it had a prick , but no-one had seen it . In this climate Panufnik , who was not a member of the Communist Party , attempted to tread an acceptable path by composing works based on historical Polish music ; to this end he wrote his Old Polish Suite .",
      "His Nocturne was singled out for criticism , and later General W\u0142odzimierz Sokorski , Secretary of Culture , announced that Panufniks Sinfonia Rustica had ceased to exist . Panufnik later described the symphony as a patently innocent work , and he found it particularly galling that one of the panel that decided on the works proscription had earlier been on the panel that had awarded it first prize in the Chopin Composition Competition . The work was nevertheless published by the State Publishing House and , as Adrian Thomas has shown , performances of the work continued sporadically in Poland . While his compositions were branded at home as formalist , Panufnik was promoted abroad as a cultural export , both as composer and conductor . The authorities awarded him their highest accolade , Standard of Labour First Class .",
      "In 1950 , Panufnik visited the Soviet Union as part of a Polish delegation to study Soviet teaching methods . He met Dmitri Shostakovich , whom he had befriended at previous conferences , and Aram Khachaturian . During conversations with lesser composers , Panufnik was pressed to say what he was working on . Having to say something acceptable , he casually mentioned that he had an idea for a Symphony of Peace . This was seized upon , and on returning to Poland he was granted a stay in quiet surroundings so that he could finish the piece ( Panufnik interpreted this as an order to complete it ) . He wrote a three movement work , ending with a setting of words by his friend , the poet Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz . Panufnik hoped to work his own conception of peace into the composition , rather than the official Soviet ideology . The piece was not a success with the authorities .",
      "While he was writing the Symphony of Peace , he was struck by the beauty of an Irish woman he met , Marie Elizabeth OMahoney , who was known as Scarlett because of her likeness ( both physical and temperamental ) to Scarlett OHara from Margaret Mitchells novel Gone with the Wind . Even though she was honeymooning with her third husband , she and Panufnik started an affair . Panufnik soon discovered she was epileptic , but in spite of his doubts the couple were married in 1951 and soon had a baby daughter , Oonagh . Panufnik now had a young family to support , and so threw himself into his lucrative work for the Film Unit . For one film he again turned to old Polish music , and he eventually adapted this score for the concert work Concerto in modo antico . In 1952 Panufnik composed a Heroic Overture , based on an idea he had conceived in 1939 inspired by the struggle of Poland against Nazi oppression . He submitted this work ( without divulging its true meaning ) for the 1952 pre-Olympic music competition in Helsinki , and it won . However , at home this overture was also branded formalist .",
      "In the spring of 1953 , Panufnik was sent , with the Chamber Orchestra of the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra , on a tour of China , where he met prime-minister Zhou Enlai and , briefly , Chairman Mao . In his first days there , he heard devastating news that his adored Oonagh had been drowned while Scarlett had an epileptic attack while she was bathing her . After returning to Warsaw he was asked to write a letter that the government could send to western musicians , ostensibly from Panufnik , to sound them out as to their sympathies with the Polish Peace Movement . Panufnik described this as effectively an order to spy for Moscow , and as the last in a succession of final straws . Thus in 1954 Panufnik no longer felt able to reconcile his patriotic desire to remain a Polish composer in Poland with his contempt for the musical and political demands of the government . He decided to migrate to Britain to highlight the conditions in which Polish composers were being forced to work .",
      "Bernard Jacobson described the events of Panufniks escape from Poland as being straight out of a John le Carr\u00e9 novel . Scarlett , whose father lived in Britain , easily obtained permission to travel to London , and while she was there she covertly asked Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 friends to help . They contrived a conducting engagement in Switzerland as cover . Panufnik was anxious not to arouse suspicion by appearing too eager to accept the invitation when it arrived . While Panufnik was fulfilling the engagement , the Polish Legation in Switzerland became aware of his impending escape , and urgently recalled him to the Polish Embassy . Panufnik gave members of the Secret Police who were following him the slip during an alarming night-time taxi-ride through Z\u00fcrich . He eventually boarded a flight for London , and was granted political asylum on arrival . His defection made international headlines . The Polish government branded him a traitor , immediately suppressing his music and any record of his conducting achievements , publicising numerous calumnies against him . Although a few subsequent Polish performances nevertheless did occur ( as shown by the Panufnik scholar Adrian Thomas ) , with his defection Panufnik became a nonperson , and remained so until 1977 .",
      "Life in the West .",
      "Having left Poland without any money or possessions , income from occasional conducting engagements made it hard for Panufnik to make ends meet . He received financial support from fellow composers including Ralph Vaughan Williams and Arthur Benjamin ; Panufnik was as heartened by the gesture of professional solidarity as by the money . His old friend the pianist Witold Ma\u0142cu\u017cy\u0144ski also helped by finding for Panufnik a wealthy patron . Scarlett Panufnik published a book about Panufniks life in Poland and his escape , but its surmises and inaccuracies distressed Panufnik ; Panufnik and Scarlett drifted apart , as she craved excitement and society while he wanted only peace and quiet for composing .",
      "In 1960 , Panufnik visited the United States to visit Leopold Stokowski . Stokowski had given the American premiere of the Symphony of Peace in 1953 , and in 1957 he conducted the world premiere of Panufniks revised version of the symphony , entitled Sinfonia Elegiaca , which is dedicated to all the victims of World War II . Stokowski gave American premieres also of Panufniks Katy\u0144 Epitaph , his Universal Prayer and Sinfonia Sacra .",
      "Panufnik continued to find it frustratingly difficult to get permission to travel to the States . In the wake of McCarthyism , the staff at the American Embassy in London were unhelpful , and treated him with suspicion : Panufnik was surprised to have to supply fingerprints , and he was pointedly asked more than once whether he had ever been a member of the Polish United Workers Party . The irony of this difficulty , after his recent public defection to the west , was not lost on Panufnik .",
      "Shortly after settling in Britain Panufnik was given an exclusive publishing contract with the prestigious firm of Boosey & Hawkes . They could get no answer from the Polish State publishers as to their long-term intentions for Panufniks existing works , all of which had appeared under their imprint . Panufnik was therefore advised to introduce small revisions into all his existing works to avoid copyright problems when Boosey & Hawkes took these works into their catalogue . Just after he completed this task , he heard that the Polish State Publishers had finally confirmed that they had no further interest in their catalogue of Panufniks music . Panufnik bemoaned the time wasted , and indeed the surviving original scores ( copies of which had already been sent to some libraries in the West , including Harvard University ) show that Panufniks revisions excised some of the more radical passages in these works . Nevertheless , all the music he wrote before 1955 continues to be performed in the revised editions . For two years from 1957 to 1959 Panufniks financial situation eased slightly when he was appointed Principal Conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra . The orchestra was keen to keep him , but preparing for fifty concerts a year prevented Panufnik from devoting enough time to composing .",
      "In 1959 , Panufnik became romantically involved with Winsome Ward , who was diagnosed with cancer the following year . During this time , Panufnik , who had been composing his Autumn Music with poetic intentions , changed it into a work with tragic connotations . He still had to complete his Piano Concerto for Birmingham and to fulfil his commission for his Sinfonia Sacra . In 1960 he met author and photographer Camilla Jessel , then aged twenty-two , who had worked as a personal assistant in the United States , and whose brother , Toby Jessel , was in politics . The British MP Neil Marten ( who had been the person at the British Foreign Office responsible for looking after Panufniks defection ) suggested that Camilla Jessel could help him with his correspondence . Panufnik accepted , and she rapidly discovered that he had not replied to letters offering conducting engagements and enquiring about commissions . Accepting these engagements and commissions gave Panufnik the resources to allow him to devote more time to composition . In 1963 , Panufnik entered his newly completed Sinfonia Sacra for a prestigious international competition in Monaco for the best orchestral work : it won first prize .",
      "He became a British citizen in 1961 . After Winsome Ward died in 1962 , Panufnik and Jessel were drawn increasingly together , and they were married in November 1963 . They moved into a house near the Thames in Twickenham , Greater London , where at last Panufnik had the peace to concentrate entirely on composition . His works were in demand by such major figures as Leopold Stokowski , Seiji Ozawa , Andr\u00e9 Previn and Sir Georg Solti , as well as Yehudi Menuhin who commissioned a violin concerto , and Mstislav Rostropovich who commissioned a cello concerto . He also received 3 commissions from the London Symphony Orchestra and commissions for Centenary symphonies from both Boston and Chicago . The Royal Philharmonic Society commissioned his Ninth Symphony , Sinfonia di Speranza . Panufnik refused to return to Poland until democracy was restored in 1990 . He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991 . He died in Twickenham , aged 77 , and was buried in Richmond Cemetery . His daughter Roxanna ( b . 1968 ) , by his second wife Camilla , is also a composer .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Panufnik was posthumously awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta by Poland . Following his death Sir Georg Solti wrote that he was an important composer and first-class conductor , the finest protagonist of the European tradition of music making .",
      "In 2014 , his centenary year , a number of celebratory concerts and events took place . Highlights included symphony performances , in February , by the London Symphony Orchestra and Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra , two orchestras that had particularly close associations with Panufnik . A special concert on 24 September , his birthday , by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra included performances of the Piano Concerto and Sinfonia Elegiaca . A Panufnik day , on 30 November , at Kings Place in London featured the Brodsky Quartet . In November , the S\u00e3o Paulo Symphony Orchestra gave two performances of the Tragic Overture with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski conducting . Also in 2014 , the German record label Classic Produktion Osnabruck completed the publication of an eight-volume cycle of Panufniks symphonic works , conducted by \u0141ukasz Borowicz .",

      "Paula Hitler",
      "Paula Hitler , also known as Paula Wolff and Paula Hitler-Wolff , ( 26 January 1896 \u2013 1 June 1960 ) was the younger sister of Adolf Hitler and the last child of Alois Hitler and his third wife , Klara P\u00f6lzl .",
      "Pre-war life .",
      "Paula Hitler was born in Hafeld , Austria on 26 January 1896 to Alois Hitler and Klara Hitler n\u00e9e P\u00f6lzl . She was Adolf Hitlers only full sister . She was six years old when her father , a retired customs official , died , and eleven when she lost her mother Klara , after which the Austrian government provided a small pension to Paula and Adolf . However , the amount was relatively meager and Hitler , who was by then old enough to support himself , agreed to sign his share over to her .",
      "Paula later moved to Vienna . In the early 1920s , she was hired as a housekeeper at a dormitory for Jewish university students . In 1921 , while she worked at the dormitory , she was visited by her brother who she said appeared as if he had fallen from heaven . For the most part , she had no other contact with her brother during his struggling years as a painter in Vienna and later Munich , his military service during World War I and his early political activities back . She was delighted to meet him again in Vienna during the early 1930s .",
      "Paula used the surname Hiedler , the original spelling of Hitler . By her own account , after losing a job with the Austrian State Insurance Company on 2 August 1930 when her employers found out who she was , Paula received financial support of 250 schillings a month from her brother , and lived under the assumed surname of Wolff at Hitlers request . Wolf was a childhood nickname of his which he had also used during the 1920s for security purposes .",
      "Hitler appears to have had a low opinion of Paulas intelligence , referring to both Paula and their half-sister Angela as stupid geese .",
      "Paula later claimed to have seen her brother about once a year during the 1930s and early 1940s . She worked as a secretary in a military field hospital for much of World War II .",
      "On 14 April 1945 , during the closing days of the war , at the age of 49 , she was driven by two SS men to Berchtesgaden , Germany \u2013 the location of Hitlers summer home , the Berghof \u2013 apparently on the orders of Martin Bormann . She and her half-sister , Angela were each given 100,000 marks on Hitlers orders .",
      "There is some evidence Paula shared her brothers strong German nationalist beliefs , but she was not politically active and never joined the Nazi Party .",
      "Post-war life .",
      "Paula was arrested by US counter-intelligence officers on 26 May 1945 and interviewed on 12 July . A transcript shows one of the agents remarking she bore a physical resemblance to her brother . She told them that the Soviets had confiscated her house in Austria , that the Americans had expropriated her Vienna apartment , and that she was taking English lessons .",
      "She characterized her childhood relationship with her brother as one of both constant bickering and strong affection . Paula said that she could not bring herself to believe that her brother had been responsible for the Holocaust . She had also told them that she had met Eva Braun only once . After her debriefing , Paula was released from American custody and returned to Vienna , where she lived on her savings for a time , then worked in an arts and crafts shop .",
      "She returned to Berchtesgaden on 1 December 1952 and took up full-time residence there under the name Paula Wolff or Paula Hitler-Wolff , in connection with a claim she had filed under Hitlers will , which had been denied by a court . During this time , she was looked after by former members of the SS and survivors of her brothers inner circle .",
      "In February 1959 , she agreed to be interviewed by Peter Morley , a documentary producer for Associated-Rediffusion , an ITV commercial station in Great Britain . The conversation was the only filmed interview she ever gave and was broadcast as part of a programme called Tyranny : The Years of Adolf Hitler . She talked mostly about Hitlers childhood and refused to be drawn on political questions . Footage from this and a contemporary interview with Peter Morley was included in the 2005 television documentary The Hitler Family ( original German title Familie Hitler . Im Schatten des Diktators ) , directed by Oliver Halmburger and Thomas Staehler .",
      "Death and burial .",
      "Paula died on 1 June 1960 in Sch\u00f6nau near Berchtesgaden , at the age of 64 , the last surviving member of Hitlers immediate family . She was buried in the Bergfriedhof in Berchtesgaden/Sch\u00f6nau under the name Paula Hitler . In June 2005 , the wooden grave marker and remains were reportedly removed and replaced with another burial , a common practice in German cemeteries after two or more decades have elapsed . In May 2006 , however , it was reported the grave marker had been returned to Paulas grave and a second marker had been added , indicating another more recent burial in the same spot .",
      "Five months after her death , the Federal Court in Berchtesgaden issued a certificate of inheritance in which Paula Hitler was awarded two-thirds of Hitlers estate ."

      "John J . Pettus",
      "John Jones Pettus ( October 9 , 1813January 25 , 1867 ) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 23rd Governor of Mississippi , from 1859 to 1863 . Prior to being elected in his own right to full gubernatorial terms in 1859 and 1861 , he served as acting governor from January 5 to 10 , 1854 , following the resignation of Henry S . Foote . A member of the Democratic Party , Pettus had previously been a Mississippi state representative , a member and president of the Mississippi Senate . He strongly supported Mississippis secession from the Union in 1861 and sought cooperation with the Confederate States Government .",
      "Early life .",
      "John Jones Pettus was born on October 9 , 1813 in Wilson County , Tennessee , to John Jones , a farmer , and his wife Alice Taylor ( n\u00e9e Winston ) Pettus . He was the brother of Edmund Pettus . He was raised in Limestone County , Alabama , after his father moved the family from Tennessee . Only nine when his father died , Pettus helped out with chores and was educated at home by his mother . Pettus settled in Mississippi in 1835 . After a brief stay in Sumter County , Alabama , where he studied law , he opened a law practice in Scooba , Mississippi , where in the 1840s he married a cousin , Permelia Winston . He became a successful farmer and by 1850 owned with twenty-four slaves .",
      "Political career .",
      "In 1844 , Pettus represented Kemper County in the Mississippi House of Representatives . In 1848 , he was elected to the Mississippi Senate . In 1853 , while Governor Henry S . Foote was waiting for the January 11 inauguration of John J . McRae , Foote grew bitter and angry , addressing the legislative session by announcing that he had considered resigning in protest once the election results came in . At noon at January 5 , 1854 , Footes resignation was received by the state senate .",
      "The Mississippi Constitution of 1832 had abolished the office of lieutenant governor . Pettus , as President of the Mississippi Senate , was next in seniority and sworn at noon on January 7 , 1854 . He held the governorship until McRae was sworn in on January 10 , 1854 . His only recorded act during these 120 hours was to order a special session in Noxubee County to fill the office of a deceased state representative , Francis Irby . On January 11 , McRae was inaugurated as Governor and Pettus returned as senate president . During the 1850s , he became identified as the Mississippi Fire-eater , a term referring to Southerners supporting secession .",
      "In 1859 , he was elected Governor . In his inaugural address , he said that the souths only way to maintain slavery was secession and called for the establishment of a southern confederacy . Following President Abraham Lincolns election , on November 26 , 1860 , Pettus called for a Special Session of the Legislature and urged the Legislature to call for a convention to withdraw Mississippi from the Union . The Legislature called for a Secession Convention which convened in Jackson on January 7 , 1861 . Two days later , Mississippi officially seceded from the Union . On February 4 , 1861 , along with five other slave states , the Confederate States of America was established at Montgomery , Alabama . Pettus was re-elected in the fall of 1861 . Pettus was succeeded by Charles Clark .",
      "Later life .",
      "Ineligible under the Mississippi Constitution to run for a third term , Pettus was commissioned a colonel in the state militia . In September 1865 he took the oath of allegiance to the United States government , but failed on three separate occasions to receive a presidential pardon . After the war , he relocated to Pulaski County ( present-day Lonoke County ) , Arkansas . Pettus died on January 25 , 1867 , of pneumonia and is buried in the Flat Bayou Cemetery , Jefferson County , Arkansas ."

      "Line 7 of the Beijing Subway ( ) is a rapid transit line in Beijing . It runs parallel and to the south of Line 1 and Batong line , from the Beijing West railway station in Fengtai District to in Tongzhou District . Like Line 6 , Line 7 provides additional relief to the overcapacity Line 1 adding another east\u2013west trunk line to the Beijing Subway network .",

      "Line 6 was originally conceived in 1973 as a pan-handle shaped route incorporating the central sections of todays Lines 6 and 7 . In 1983 Line 6 was dissolved into two distinct lines . The section under Guanganmen , Luomashi , Zhushikou and Guangqumen Streets and the handle branch to Fengtai became Line 7 . The rest of the loop with a new south eastern extension to what was at the time the Beijing Jiaohuachang ( Coking Plant ) complex became Line 6 . Line 7 was later revised westward to terminate at a new major railway station called Beijing West railway station and Line 9 taking over servicing Fengtai . When Beijing West railway station started construction in the early 1990s space was set aside for a subway station allowing Cross-platform interchange for the future Lines 7 and 9 . By 1993 the planned section of Line 6 heading to Coking Plant complex was revised as an eastern extension of Line 7 , forming the alignment built today .",
      "In 2013 , planners revised the design of Line 7 from using the standard 6 car trains to 8 car trains after performing a detailed transport study of the Fatou area . Fatous population projections were upgraded from 100,000 to 220,000 people and be a significant employment hub in the future . Planners decided that 6 cars trains would have insufficient capacity for the new demand projections . Line 7 was originally planned to use 1500 V DC overhead lines to power the longer subway trains . However , the already completed platforms at Beijing West railway station assumed the line would use a 750 V DC 3rd rail system like Beijings legacy subway lines and built with vertical clearance for such . The line ultimately used a 1500 V DC 3rd rail system as a compromise .",

      "British Rail Class 15",
      "The British Rail Class 15 diesel locomotives , also known as the BTH Type 1 , were designed by British Thomson-Houston , and built by the Yorkshire Engine Company and the Clayton Equipment Company , between 1957 and 1961 . They were numbered D8200-D8243 .",
      "The Class 15 was ordered by British Railways ( BR ) shortly after the announcement of the 1955 Modernisation Plan , which led to the procurement of a diverse number of diesel locomotives under the pilot scheme . Shortly following the completion of the first locomotive during 1957 , its performance was sufficient to justify multiple follow-on orders , leading to a total fleet of 44 locomotives . In service , the type was relatively unreliable , much of this been traceable to its Paxman 16YHXL power unit . Its fortunes were further impacted by inconsistent policy making . During the late 1960s , it was decided to withdraw the Class 15 in favour of the more numerous and successful British Rail Class 20 locomotive , both types having been developed to satisfy the same Type 1 specification . Their final use was as departmental vehicles , coming to an end in the late 1980s . One example has survived into preservation .",
      "Background .",
      "In less than a decade following the formation of British Railways ( BR ) , substantial changes were being made . Under the 1955 Modernisation Plan , a long-term strategy of replacing steam locomotives with a combination of diesel locomotives and electric locomotives was adopted , with the former being largely intended as an interim measure for most areas ahead of widespread electrification of trunk routes . There was also a strong political desire to support British manufacturers in transitioning towards the design and production of these favoured forms of traction . Due to a lack of expertise , this often involved the pairing of traditional locomotive manufacturers with various firms within the electrical sector , even though the latter typically had very limited experience of the railways .",
      "In accordance with these policies , BR ramped up its efforts to convert its fleet , placing numerous orders within a short timeframe for diesel locomotives to several different specifications with various manufactures . It placed four separate lots of orders , for a cumulative 44 BTH Type 1 diesel locomotives with the heavy engineering company British Thomson-Houston ( BTH ) . The first batch of locomotives was primarily intended for evaluation purposes , this initiative coming under the remit of BRs pilot scheme .",
      "Construction .",
      "While BTH was appointed as the main contractor and was viewed as being capable of designing the type , the company lacked capacity at its facility in Rugby , Warwickshire , and thus was unable to produce the locomotives inhouse . The practical resolution to this was to subcontract both the design and manufacture of the mechanical elements ( e.g . running gear , bogies , bodies ) to other firms , primarily the Yorkshire Engine Company and the Clayton Equipment Company , neither of which had any experience with main line diesel locomotives .",
      "Accordingly , the design and manufacture of the type was a collaborative effort between these companies . Specifically , while BTH supplied the majority of the electrical equipment , Paxman supplied the power units , Clayton supplied the bogies and superstructure , construction of the frame and final assembly occurred at Yorkshire Engines Sheffield works , for the initial batch of ten locomotives . However , final assembly was transferred to Clayton for all subsequent batches .",
      "The design of the locomotive was in conformance with the stated requirements listed in the Type 1 specification . As such , this led to the inclusion of numerous features such as provisions for operating in multiple with other members of the type . The propulsion system consisted of a single Paxman 16YHXL engine that provided up to that , via a diesel-electric transmission , drove four individual DC traction motors . In comparison with a typical locomotive , the design featured a relatively high-speed engine for the era .",
      "During late 1957 , the first example of the type emerged . Furthermore , the type was envisioned for serving various types of smaller trains on secondary routes , such as the haulage of local freight and empty coaching stock trains . However , the fortunes of the class were somewhat impacted by the pilot scheme being abruptly terminated amid persistent budgetary shortages .",
      "The performance of the initial batch of 10 locomotives quickly showed the design held promise , leading to repeat orders for 34 more locomotives to be placed soon after their entry into service . These locomotives , numbered D8210\u2013D8243 , were constructed at Claytons facility in Hatton , Derbyshire , were delivered between October 1959 and February 1961 .",
      "Operations .",
      "Introduction .",
      "The first ten locomotives were delivered to the London Midland Regions Devons Road depot in Bow , East London , where they were evaluated against the contemporary North British Type 1 ( class 16 ) and English Electric Type 1 ( class 20 ) designs . Soon , however , the entire class was allocated to depots on the Eastern Region , where they remained until withdrawal . The second block of ten was originally allocated to March depot in East Anglia , however due to the Clean Air Act 1956 the locomotives were quickly re-allocated to East London , allowing the replacement of steam locomotives in that area . Thereafter , the type was allocated exclusively to Stratford , Finsbury Park and Ipswich depots .",
      "For a period , a single Class 15 was operated as the station pilot at Liverpool Street station , the last locomotive used being 8234 which was replaced by a Class 08 on 4 October 1971 .",
      "A member of the class also worked the train ferry shunt at Harwich Town during the 1960s .",
      "Problems and impact .",
      "The Class 15 was troubled by its relatively high level of unreliability , which was largely centered around the types Paxman engine ; as delivered , the engine was found to require excessive maintenance . A series of modifications to the pistons , piston rings and maintenance schedules , and fitting cast iron cylinder heads led to considerable improvements in the engines reliability , however , it remained a complex V16 for only providing 800 bhp , while the small size of the class bore poorly at a time when the rail network was rapidly contracting . Furthermore , the layout of the locomotive , which positioned its single cab part-way down the body akin to a North American road-switcher , provided the crew with a relatively poor forward visibility in both directions of travel , although this was initially tolerated as it was no worse than the visibility offered by the cab of a steam locomotive .",
      "According to railway author Rodger Bradley , the shortcomings of the Class 15 were not so much attributable to its designers but largely came as a consequence of ill-defined requirements , which can be largely attributed back to moving government policies . Additional factors highlighted by Bradley include a general dependence upon on the wider British electrical industry to both design and deliver numerous subsystems that would function sufficiently well upon the often-challenging railway environment , along with radical changes to the national economy during this era had also impacted the types suitability to these broader circumstances and thus its overall performance . Despite these various issues , the Class 15 can be considered to be more successful than several contemporary Type 1 locomotives , such as the Class 16 and the later Class 17 .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "On 21 November 1963 , locomotive No . D8221 crashed through buffers whilst shunting at Ipswich engine shed and ended up across Croft Street . After attempts to tow it back onto the track using diesel locomotives failed , it was retrieved using the only steam locomotive in service at Ipswich , which had been retained for carriage heating purposes .",
      "Withdrawal .",
      "Following a persistent decline in freight duties in the London area , in combination with the type being a relatively small and unsuccessful non-standard class , the type was considered to be surplus to requirements by the late 1960s . The ubiquitous British Rail Class 20 , which had been developed to meet the same Type 1 specification , was more numerous and had proved to be less troublesome to operate , thus it effectively replaced the type in all operational respects . The type was speedily removed from traffic , being withdrawn from capital stock between April 1968 and March 1971 . D8225 was observed operating at Temple Mills as late as 28 March 1971",
      "After withdrawal 23 of the class were stored at the former Ipswich engine shed during 1971 before being hauled away , generally as part of booked freight trains , for scrapping .",
      "Conversion .",
      "All but four locomotives had been broken up for scrap by the end of 1972 . The four Class 15s that survived were used for departmental service for a time , for which they were converted into non-powered electric train pre-heating units based at Doncaster Works . These duties kept the locomotives in active use for another ten years or more , until these final examples were again found to be redundant and finally withdrawn .",
      "Preservation .",
      "One of the former train heating units , D8233 , was purchased for preservation in 1984 and is now the only survivor of the type . It was originally kept at the South Yorkshire Railway in Sheffield , moving in 1986 to the East Lancashire Railway , and in 1988 to the Mangapps Farm Railway , where it remained until 1993 . D8233 then moved to Crewe following an agreement with the Waterman Heritage Trust . Since its initial preservation the locomotive had received little work apart from cosmetic attention . Some work was carried out by the Waterman Heritage Trust , however the locomotives restoration remained dormant until the end of 2005 , when a reformed owning group , alongside the WHT , agreed the time was right to accelerate the locomotives return to service . With an active plan for work agreed , the locomotive returned to the East Lancashire Railway in February 2006 , where its restoration to working order is now under way .",
      "Models .",
      "A ready to run model in 00 gauge was available from TechCad design based on a hand finished resin shell and powered by a Mashima motor . It was then available from TechCad as a kit , but TechCad have since ceased trading . Since 2010 , Heljan have produced an OO gauge ready-to-run model in a variety of liveries .",
      "An N gauge kit of a member of the class is available from BH Enterprises , powered by a Graham Farish Class 20 chassis .",
      "An O gauge ready-to-run model is currently in production by Little Loco Company",

Hans Els\u00e4sser , an astronomer , became the founding director in 1968 . In February 1969 , a first group of 5 employees started work in the buildings of the neighbouring K\u00f6nigstuhl State Observatory . The institute , which was completed in 1975 , was initially dedicated to the preparation and evaluation of astronomical observations and the development of new measurement methods .",

This largest observatory on the European mainland was used equally by astronomers from both countries until 2019 . On 23 May 2019 , the regional government of Andalusia and the MPG signed a transfer agreement for the 50% share in the observatory . Since then , it has been owned exclusively by Spain .",
      "Since 2005 , the MPIA has been operating the Large Binocular Telescope ( LBT ) together with partners from Germany , Italy and the USA and equipping it with measuring instruments . The LBT is located on Mount Graham near Tucson , Arizona , which is 3190 m high .

Izmail , formerly \u0422\u0443\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432 ( Tuchkov ) ; or Smil ; , ) is a historic city on the Danube river in Odessa Oblast in south-western Ukraine . Administratively , Izmail is incorporated as a city of oblast significance . It also serves as the administrative center of Izmail Raion , one of seven districts of Odessa Oblast , though it is not a part of the district .",
      "In Russian historiography Izmail is associated with the 18th century sacking of Ottoman fortress of Izmail by Russian general Alexander Suvorov .",
      "It is the largest Ukrainian port in the Danube Delta , on its Chilia branch . As such , Izmail is a center of the food processing industry and a popular regional tourist destination . It is also a base of the Ukrainian Navy and the Ukrainian Sea Guard units operating on the river . The World Wildlife Funds Isles of Izmail Regional Landscape Park is located nearby . Population :",
      "History .",
      "The fortress of Izmail was built by Genoese merchants in the 12th century . It belonged for a short period of time to Wallachia ( 14th century ) \u2013 as the territory north of the Danube was one of the possessions of the Basarabs ( later the land being named after them , Bessarabia ) . The town was first mentioned with the name Ismailiye , derived from the name of the Ottoman Grand Vizier Izmail .",
      "From the end of the 14th century , Izmail was under the rule of Moldavia . In 1484 , the Ottoman state conquered the territory , which became from that moment an Ottoman protectorate ( under direct rule from 1538 ) . Since the early 16th century it was the main Ottoman fortress in the Budjak region . In 1569 Sultan Selim II settled Izmail with his Nogai subjects , originally from the North Caucasus .",
      "After Russian general Nicholas Repnin took the fortress of Izmail in 1770 , it was heavily refortified by the Turks , so as never to be captured again . The Sultan boasted that the fortress was impregnable , but during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787\u20131792 the Russian Army commander Alexander Suvorov successfully stormed it on 22 December 1790 . Ottoman forces inside the fortress had the orders to stand their ground to the end , haughtily declining the Russian ultimatum . The defeat was seen as a catastrophe in the Ottoman Empire , while in Russia it was glorified in the countrys first national anthem , Let the thunder of victory sound! .",
      "Suvorov announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the Empress Catherine in a doggerel couplet , after the assault had been pressed from house to house , room to room , most of the garrison and support forces in the city had been killed in three days , a few hundred taken into captivity . For all his bluffness , Suvorov later told an English traveler that when all was over he went back to his tent and wept .",
      "At the end of the war , Izmail was returned to the Ottoman Empire , but Russian forces took it for the third time on 14 September 1809 . After it was ceded to Russia with the rest of Bessarabia by the 1812 Treaty of Bucharest , the town was rebuilt thoroughly . The Intercession Cathedral ( 1822\u201336 ) , the churches of Nativity ( 1823 ) , St . Nicholas ( 1833 ) and several others date back to that time . Izmails oldest building is the small Turkish mosque , erected either in the 15th or 16th centuries , converted into a church in 1810 and currently housing a museum dedicated to the 1790 storm of Izmail .",
      "After Russia lost the Crimean War , the town returned to the Principality of Moldavia , which would soon become part of the Romanian Principalities . Russia gained control of Izmail again after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878 . With the breakup of the Russian Empire in 1917 and in the aftermath of World War I , the city was occupied by the Romanian Army on 22 January 1918 , after a skirmish with troops of the Danube flotilla . Later that year , the Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii of Chi\u0219in\u0103u , which claimed to be the representative of the whole of Bessarabia , voted to formally unite the region with Romania . This union was recognized by the United Kingdom , France and Italy in the Treaty of Paris , but not by the Soviet Union which had territorial claims over Bessarabia .",
      "In 1940 , and again during World War II , it was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and included ( August 1940 ) in the Ukrainian SSR ; the region was occupied in 1941\u20131944 by the Romanian Army participating in Operation Barbarossa . During the Soviet period following World War II , many Russians and Ukrainians migrated to the town , gradually changing its ethnic composition . Izmail Oblast was formed in 1940 and the town remained its administrative center until the oblast was merged to Odessa Oblast in 1954 . Since 24 August 1991 , Izmail has been part of independent Ukraine .",

Summers are hot and humid , with temperatures somewhat moderated by the citys elevation . Winters are cool but variable , with an average of 48 freezing days per year .",
      "Demographics .",
      "Before 1920 , the population of Izmail was estimated at 37,000 . During that time , approximately 11,000 of the population were Jewish , 8,000 Romanians and 6,000 Germans . Additional members of the population were Russians , Bulgarians , Turks and Cossacks .",

      "Max Dreyfus",
      "Max Dreyfus ( April 1 , 1874 \u2013 May 12 , 1964 ) was a German-born American music publisher , arranger and songwriter . Between the 1910s and 1950s he encouraged and published the work of many of the writers of the so-called Great American Songbook , and was president of Chappell & Co. , Inc . American office , the worlds largest music publishing firm .",
      "Biography .",
      "He was born in Kuppenheim , Germany , the son of a cattle dealer . At the age of 14 he traveled to the USA at the invitation of family friend Aaron Lehman who had immigrated to Jackson , Mississippi . Initially , Dreyfus worked as a travelling salesman selling picture frames , but by the mid-1890s worked on Tin Pan Alley in New York City where he worked closely with songwriter Paul Dresser and transcribed song arrangements . Within a few years he had secured a post with the publishing firm set up by Thomas B . Harms ( 1860-1906 ) , arranging , plugging songs , and doing some songwriting ; his song Cupids Garden , published under the pseudonym Max Eugene , was successful in 1901 .",
      "Harms sold his share in the family publishing firm in 1904 to Max and his younger brother Louis Dreyfus ( 1877-1967 ) , who had joined him in the US . The two brothers retained the company name T . B . Harms , and established a partnership with the London firm of Francis , Day & Hunter , allowing them to market their songs in Britain . They also encouraged young new songwriters in New York , most notably Jerome Kern , who soon achieved success and became a partner in the company . After the First World War , the company had commercial success with songs such as Poor Butterfly , and more songwriters joined the company , including George Gershwin , Richard Rodgers , Lorenz Hart , Rudolf Friml , Vincent Youmans , Irving Caesar , and Cole Porter .",
      "In 1920 , the brothers were approached by the British publishers , Chappell & Co. , to handle their interests in the US . By 1926 , they had bought Chappell outright , and shortly before the Great Depression they made a highly profitable sale of their interest in T . B . Harms . The companies remained independent of the Hollywood system which bought up many of the other publishing houses , with the result that the brothers retained a strong financial position . In 1935 , they reconstituted their holdings as Chappell , Inc. , with Louis Dreyfus moving to London and Max remaining in control of their New York operations , based in the Rockefeller Center .",
      "Max Dreyfus was a softspoken , slightly built man who was reserved almost to a fault . He was seen as a man of integrity and a gifted talent spotter . He helped found ASCAP ( the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ) in 1914 , and served as a board member for fifty years until shortly before his death . He pioneered a new style of orchestration for theatre performances , employing Russell Bennett as the companys chief orchestrator from 1919 . He established a company policy under which composers , lyricists and librettists were all in partnership with the publishing company . He insisted on exclusive contracts for many of his writers and orchestrators working on Broadway shows , with the result that through the thirties and forties , Dreyfus had a virtual stranglehold on the Broadway musical , with almost all of the most successful songwriters ( except Berlin ) under contract . And the best and most knowledgeable theatrical orchestrators as well .",
      "He remained in control of Chappell & Co . after World War II , with new writers including Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe , whose My Fair Lady he published . Although other independent publishers took a larger share of the market after the war , Chappell also found success with South Pacific , The Sound of Music , Gypsy , and Funny Girl , among others .",
      "Dreyfus was played by Charles Coburn , who was considerably bulkier and more gregarious than him , in the 1945 Gershwin biographical film Rhapsody in Blue . Dreyfus did not like the film , saying to a friend , \u201cDid you ever see me wear a top hat ?\u201d",
      "Personal life .",
      "Max Dreyfus and his wife , the former Victoria Brill , had no children . They bought a 300-acre summer home near Brewster , New York , Madrey Farm , in 1929 .

      "Reinhard Scheer",
      "Carl Friedrich Heinrich Reinhard Scheer ( 30 September 1863 \u2013 26 November 1928 ) was an Admiral in the Imperial German Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . Scheer joined the navy in 1879 as an officer cadet and progressed through the ranks , commanding cruisers and battleships , as well as senior staff positions on land . At the outbreak of World War I , Scheer was the commander of the II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet . He then took command of the III Battle Squadron , which consisted of the newest and most powerful battleships in the navy . In January 1916 , he was promoted to Admiral and given control of the High Seas Fleet . Scheer led the German fleet at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May \u2013 1 June 1916 , one of the largest naval battles in history .",
      "Following the battle , Scheer joined those calling for unrestricted submarine warfare against the Allies , a move the Kaiser eventually permitted . In August 1918 , Scheer was promoted to the Chief of Naval Staff ; Admiral Franz von Hipper replaced him as commander of the fleet . Together they planned a final battle against the British Grand Fleet , but war-weary sailors mutinied at the news and the operation was abandoned . Scheer retired after the end of the war .",
      "A strict disciplinarian , Scheer was popularly known in the Navy as the man with the iron mask due to his severe appearance . In 1919 , Scheer wrote his memoirs ; a year later they were translated and published in English . He wrote his autobiography in 1925 . Scheer died at Marktredwitz . He is buried in the municipal cemetery at Weimar . The admiral was commemorated in the renascent Kriegsmarine by the heavy cruiser , built in the 1930s .",
      "Early career .",
      "Scheer was born in Obernkirchen , present-day Lower Saxony . He came from a middle-class background , which initially hampered his naval career , as the Kaiserliche Marine was dominated by wealthy families .",
      "Reinhard Scheer entered the navy on 22 April 1879 aged 15 as a cadet . His first sea assignment was aboard the sail-frigate . His first cruise aboard Niobe lasted from June to September 1879 . During the cruise he was trained in navigation and engineering . Following his return to Germany in September , Scheer was assigned to the Naval School in Kiel to continue his officer training . He received only a satisfactory rating on his cadet evaluation in 1879 , but received the second highest grade in his class for the Sea Cadets Exam the following year . Following his graduation from the Naval School , Scheer embarked on a six-month-long special training program for gunnery , torpedo warfare , and infantry training . Afterward , he was assigned to the gunnery training ship . Scheer was for a short time assigned to the armored frigate . For his last year in cadet training , he was assigned to the frigate , which conducted a world tour . The ship sailed to Melbourne , Australia , Yokohama , Kobe , and Nagasaki in Japan , and Shanghai , China during the trip .",
      "Following his commission into the German navy , he was transferred to the East Africa Squadron ; his first tour with the unit lasted from 1884 to 1886 . He was assigned to the crew of the frigate . Here he was promoted to Leutnant . He also made important connections in Africa ; among those he befriended was Leutnant Henning von Holtzendorff , who would later serve as commander of the High Seas Fleet . During the assignment , in December 1884 , Scheer participated in a landing party that suppressed a pro-British indigenous chieftain in Kamerun .",
      "After his return to Germany in 1886 , Scheer took part in torpedo training aboard , from January to May 1888 . In May 1888 , Scheer returned to the East Africa Squadron as a torpedo officer aboard the corvette . This tour lasted until early summer 1890 , at which point Scheer returned to Germany , where he was made an instructor at the Torpedo Research Command in Kiel . Thus far in his career , Scheer had made a strong reputation for himself as a torpedo specialist . While stationed in Kiel , Scheer met Alfred von Tirpitz , who took note of his expertise . In 1897 , following Tirpitzs promotion to Secretary of State of the Imperial Navy Office , he transferred Scheer to the Reichsmarineamt ( RMA ) to work in the Torpedo Section .",
      "After promotion to Korvettenkapit\u00e4n , Scheer commanded the light cruiser . Scheer was promoted to Kapit\u00e4n zur See in 1905 and took command of the battleship in 1907 , a command he held for two years . A report dated 1 December 1909 recommended Scheer for promotion ; he became chief of staff to the commanding officer of the High Seas Fleet , Admiral Holtzendorff , under whom Scheer had served on the cruiser SMS Prinzess Wilhelm . Scheer reached flag rank less than six months after taking his post on Holtzendorffs staff , at the age of 47 . He held the Chief of Staff position until late 1911 , when he was transferred back to the RMA under Tirpitz . Here , he held the position of Chief of the General Naval Department through 1912 . Following this appointment , Scheer returned to a sea command , in the form of squadron commander for the six battleships of the II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet in January 1913 .",
      "World War I .",
      "On 9 December 1913 , Scheer was promoted to Vizeadmiral . He remained with the II Battle Squadron until January 1915 , by which time World War I had begun . He thereafter took command of the III Battle Squadron , which consisted of the most powerful battleships in the German fleet : the dreadnoughts of the and es . Scheer advocated raids on the British coast to lure out portions of the numerically superior Royal Navy so they could be overwhelmed by the German fleet . He was highly critical of Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , who he felt was overcautious .",
      "Following the bombardment of Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby , during which Ingenohl had withdrawn instead of attacking a weaker British squadron , Scheer remarked , [ Ingenohl ] had robbed us of the opportunity of meeting certain divisions of the enemy according to the prearranged plan , which was now seen to be correct . Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 , the Kaiser removed Ingenohl from his post on 2 February . Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet . Pohl was exceedingly cautious ; in the remainder of 1915 , he conducted only five ineffective fleet actions , all of which remained within 120 nautical miles of Helgoland .",
      "Command of the High Seas fleet .",
      "Vice Admiral Scheer became Commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Pohl became too ill to continue in that post . Upon promotion to the position , Scheer wrote Guiding Principles for Sea Warfare in the North Sea , which outlined his strategic plans . His central idea was that the Grand Fleet should be pressured by higher U-boat activity and zeppelin raids as well as increased fleet sorties . The Grand Fleet would be forced to abandon the distant blockade and would have to attack the German fleet ; the Kaiser approved the memorandum on 23 February 1916 . Now that he had approval from the Kaiser , Scheer could use the fleet more aggressively .",
      "Following the Kaisers order forbidding unrestricted submarine warfare on 24 April 1916 , Scheer ordered all of the U-boats in the Atlantic to return to Germany and abandon commerce raiding . Scheer intended to use the submarines to support the fleet by stationing the U-boats off major British naval bases . The U-boats would intercept British forces leaving the ports when provoked by a bombardment by the I Scouting Group battlecruisers under the command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper . Scheer planned the operation for 17 May , but damage to the battlecruiser from the previous month , coupled with condenser trouble on several of the battleships of III Battle Squadron caused the plan to be delayed , ultimately to 31 May .",
      "Battle of Jutland .",
      "Admiral Scheers fleet , composed of 16 dreadnoughts , six pre-dreadnoughts , six light cruisers , and 31 torpedo boats departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May . The fleet sailed in concert with Hippers five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats . The British navys Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation , and so sortied the Grand Fleet , totaling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers , the night before in order to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet .",
      "At 16:00 UTC , the two battlecruiser forces encountered each other and began a running gun fight south , back towards Scheers battle fleet . Upon reaching the High Seas Fleet , Vice Admiral David Beattys battlecruisers turned back to the north to lure the Germans towards the rapidly approaching Grand Fleet , under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe . During the run to the north , Scheers leading ships engaged the s of the 5th Battle Squadron . By 18:30 , the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene , and was deployed into a position that would cross Scheers T from the northeast . To extricate his fleet from this precarious position , Scheer ordered a 16-point turn to the south-west . At 18:55 , Scheer decided to conduct another 16-point turn to launch an attack on the British fleet ; he later explained his reasoning :",
      "It was as yet too early to assume night cruising order . The enemy could have compelled us to fight before dark , he could have prevented our exercising our initiative , and finally he could have cut off our return to the German Bight . There was only one way of avoiding this : to inflict a second blow on the enemy with another advance carried through regardless of cost...It also offered the possibility of a last attempt being made to bring help to the hard-pressed , or at least of rescuing her ships company .",
      "This maneuver again put Scheer in a dangerous position ; Jellicoe had turned his fleet south and again crossed Scheers T . A third 16-point turn followed , which was covered by a charge by Hippers mauled battlecruisers . Scheer then ordered the fleet to adopt the night cruising formation , which was completed by 23:40 . A series of ferocious engagements between Scheers battleships and Jellicoes destroyer screen ensued , though the Germans managed to punch their way through the destroyers and make for Horns Reef . The High Seas Fleet reached the Jade between 13:00 and 14:45 on 1 June ; Scheer ordered the undamaged battleships of the I Battle Squadron to take up defensive positions in the Jade roadstead while the Kaiser-class battleships were to maintain a state of readiness just outside Wilhelmshaven .",
      "Post-Jutland .",
      "After the battle was finished , Scheer wrote an assessment of the engagement for the Kaiser ; in it , he strongly urged for the resumption of the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign in the Atlantic . He argued that it was the only option to defeat Great Britain . Scheer spent the majority of the remainder of the year debating the issue with the naval command . Ultimately , Scheer and his allies prevailed and the unrestricted submarine campaign was resumed in February 1917 . Despite his conviction that only the U-boats could defeat Britain , Scheer continued to utilize the surface fleet . On 18\u201319 August 1916 , the High Seas Fleet again sortied in an attempt to draw out and defeat Admiral Beattys battlecruiser squadron . The Royal Navy again intercepted German communications and sent the Grand Fleet out . In this case , however , Scheers reconnaissance worked as intended , and warned him of the Grand Fleets approach in time to retreat back to Germany . In later 1917 , Scheer began to use light elements of the fleet to raid British convoys to Norway in the North Sea . This forced the British to deploy battleships to escort the convoys , which presented Scheer with the opportunity to attempt to isolate and destroy several battleships of the Grand Fleet . On 23 April 1918 , Scheer sent the entire High Seas Fleet to intercept one of the convoys . However , Hippers battlecruisers crossed the convoys path several times without sighting any ships ; it was later discovered that German intelligence had miscalculated the date the convoy would depart Britain . The German fleet turned south and reached their North Sea bases by 19:00 .",
      "Chief of Naval Staff .",
      "In June 1918 , Scheer was informed that the state of Admiral Holtzendorffs health would not permit him to remain in his post as chief of the naval staff much longer . On 28 July , Scheer was informed that Holtzendorff had submitted his resignation to the Kaiser . Two weeks later , on 11 August 1918 , Scheer was promoted to the Chief of Naval Staff ; his subordinate Franz von Hipper succeeded him in command of the High Seas Fleet . The following day , Scheer met with Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff to discuss the deteriorating war situation . The three agreed that the U-boat campaign would be the sole hope for a German victory , as the German army had been pushed to the defensive . Scheer then called for a crash program to build a vastly increased number of U-boats . He stipulated that , at a minimum , at least 16 additional U-boats be constructed per month in the last quarter of 1918 . This was to increase to at least an additional 30 per month by the third quarter of 1919 . In total , the plan called for 376 to 450 new U-boats . However , German naval historian Holger Herwig suggested the program was a massive propaganda effort designed to have an effect at home and abroad .",
      "In October , with the war largely lost , Scheer and Hipper envisioned one last major fleet advance to attack the British Grand Fleet . Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , to achieve a better bargaining position for Germany regardless of the cost to the navy . The plan involved two simultaneous attacks by light cruisers and destroyers , one on Flanders and another on shipping in the Thames estuary ; the five battlecruisers were to support the Thames attack while the dreadnoughts remained off Flanders . After both strikes , the fleet was to concentrate off the Dutch coast , where it would meet the Grand Fleet in battle . While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven , however , war-weary sailors began deserting en masse . As Von der Tann and Derfflinger passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshavens inner harbor and roadstead , some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore . On 24 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on several battleships mutinied ; three ships from the III Squadron refused to weigh anchors , and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships and . In the face of open rebellion , the order to sail was rescinded and the planned operation was abandoned . In an attempt to suppress the mutiny , the High Seas Fleet squadrons were dispersed .",
      "Post-war .",
      "Scheer wrote his memoirs of the Great War in 1919 , which were translated into English the following year . In October 1920 , an intruder broke into Scheers house and murdered his wife , Emillie , his maid , and injured his daughter Else . The man then committed suicide in the cellar . Following the incident , Scheer retreated into solitude . He wrote his autobiography , entitled Vom Segelschiff zum U-Boot ( From Sailing Ship to Submarine ) , which was published on 6 November 1925 .",
      "In 1928 , Scheer accepted an invitation to meet his adversary from Jutland , Admiral of the Fleet Jellicoe , in England . However , at the age of 65 , Scheer died at Marktredwitz before he could make the trip . He was buried in the municipal cemetery at Weimar . His tombstone reads : [ Here rests Admiral Reinhard Scheer ] \u2014 with the dates of his life , his flag in metal applique and the single word ( the German name for the Battle of Jutland ) .",
      "The heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer was named after Reinhard Scheer and christened by his daughter Marianne . The ship was ordered and funded by the Reichsmarine of the Weimar Republic and launched in 1933 .",

      "Myanmar",
      "Myanmar ( UK pronunciations incl . , US pronunciations incl . , ; ) or Burma ( ) , officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar , is a country in Southeast Asia . Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest , China to its northeast , Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast , and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest . Myanmar is the largest country in Mainland Southeast Asia and the 10th largest in Asia by area . As of 2017 , the population was about 54 million . Its capital city is Naypyidaw , and its largest city is Yangon ( Rangoon ) .",
      "Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Myanmar . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley , and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture , and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions , and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo dynasty , the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short period . The early 19th-century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well . The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century , and the country became a British colony . After a brief Japanese occupation , Myanmar was reconquered by the Allies and granted independence in 1948 . Following a coup d\u00e9tat in 1962 , it became a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party .",
      "For most of its independent years , the country has been engrossed in rampant ethnic strife and its myriad ethnic groups have been involved in one of the worlds longest-running ongoing civil wars . During this time , the United Nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systematic human rights violations in the country . In 2011 , the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election , and a nominally civilian government was installed . This , along with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and political prisoners , had improved the countrys human rights record and foreign relations and has led to the easing of trade and other economic sanctions . There is , however , continuing criticism of the governments treatment of ethnic minorities , its response to the ethnic insurgency , and religious clashes . In the 2015 election , Aung San Suu Kyis party won a majority in both houses . However , the Burmese military remained a powerful force in politics and , on 1 February 2021 , again seized power in a coup d\u00e9tat .",
      "Myanmar is a member of the East Asia Summit , Non-Aligned Movement , ASEAN , and BIMSTEC , but it is not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations . It is a country rich in jade and gems , oil , natural gas , and other mineral resources . Myanmar is also endowed with renewable energy ; it has the highest solar power potential compared to other countries of the Great Mekong Subregion . In 2013 , its GDP ( nominal ) stood at US$56.7 billion and its GDP ( PPP ) at US$221.5 billion . The income gap in Myanmar is among the widest in the world , as a large proportion of the economy is controlled by supporters of the military government . , according to the Human Development Index , Myanmar ranks 147 out of 189 countries in human development .",
      "Etymology .",
      "The name of the country has been a matter of dispute and disagreement , particularly in the early 21st century , focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using Myanmar versus Burma . Both names derive from the earlier Burmese Myanma or Myamma , an ethnonym for the majority Bamar ethnic group , of uncertain etymology . The terms are also popularly thought to derive from Brahma Desha or \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0936/\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924 ( Sanskrit ) after Brahma .",
      "In 1989 , the military government officially changed the English translations of many names dating back to Burmas colonial period or earlier , including that of the country itself : Burma became Myanmar . The renaming remains a contested issue . Many political and ethnic opposition groups and countries continue to use Burma because they do not recognise the legitimacy of the ruling military government or its authority to rename the country .",
      "In April 2016 , soon after taking office , Aung San Suu Kyi commented on the question of which name should be used and said that it is up to you because there is nothing in the constitution of our country that says that you must use any term in particular . She continued , I use Burma very often because I am used to using it . But it does not mean that I require other people to do that as well . And Ill make an effort to say Myanmar from time to time so you all feel comfortable .",
      "The countrys official full name is Republic of the Union of Myanmar ( , , ) . Countries that do not officially recognise that name use the long form Union of Burma instead . In English , the country is popularly known as either Burma or Myanmar . In Burmese , the pronunciation depends on the register used and is either ( ) or ( ) . The name Burma has been in use in English since the 18th century .",
      "Official United States policy retains Burma as the countrys name although the State Departments website lists the country as Burma ( Myanmar ) . The CIAs World Factbook lists the country as Burma . The government of Canada has in the past used Burma , such as in its 2007 legislation imposing sanctions but as of August 2020 generally uses Myanmar . The Czech Republic officially uses Myanmar , although its Ministry of Foreign Affairs uses both Myanmar and Burma on its website . The United Nations uses Myanmar , as do the ASEAN , Australia , Russia , Germany , China , India , Bangladesh , Norway , Japan and Switzerland . Most English-speaking international news media refer to the country by the name Myanmar , including the BBC , CNN , Al Jazeera , Reuters , and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) /Radio Australia .",
      "Myanmar is known with a name deriving from Burma as opposed to Myanmar in Spanish , Italian , Romanian , and Greek \u2013 Birmania being the local version of Burma in the Spanish language , for example . Myanmar used to be known as Birm\u00e2nia in Portuguese , and as Birmanie in French . As in the past , French-language media today consistently use Birmanie .",
      "There is no established pronunciation of the English name Myanmar , and at least nine different pronunciations exist . Those with two syllables are listed as more common by major UK and US dictionaries except Collins : , , , . Dictionaries and other sources also report pronunciations with three syllables , , , , .",
      "Wikipedias IPA conventions require indicating /r/ even in British English although only some British English speakers pronounce r at the end of syllables . As John Wells explains , the English spellings of both Myanmar and Burma assume a non-rhotic variety of English , in which the letter r before a consonant or finally serves merely to indicate a long vowel : [ \u02c8mj\u00e6nm\u0251\u02d0 , \u02c8b\u025c\u02d0m\u0259 ] . So the pronunciation of the last syllable of Myanmar as [ m\u0251\u02d0r ] or of Burma as [ b\u025c\u02d0rm\u0259 ] by some speakers in the UK and all in North America is in fact a spelling pronunciation based on a misunderstanding of non-rhotic spelling conventions . The final r in Myanmar was not intended for pronunciation and is there to ensure that the final a is pronounced with the broad ah ( ) in father . If the Burmese name were spelled Myanma in English , this would be pronounced at the end by all English speakers . If it were spelled Myanmah , the end would be pronounced by all English speakers .",
      "History .",
      "Prehistory .",
      "Archaeological evidence shows that Homo erectus lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 750,000 years ago , with no more erectus finds after 75,000 years ago . The first evidence of Homo sapiens is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar . Evidence of Neolithic age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of cave paintings in Padah-Lin Caves .",
      "The Bronze Age arrived when people in the region were turning copper into bronze , growing rice and domesticating poultry and pigs ; they were among the first people in the world to do so . Human remains and artefacts from this era were discovered in Monywa District in the Sagaing Region . The Iron Age began around 500 BCE with the emergence of iron-working settlements in an area south of present-day Mandalay . Evidence also shows the presence of rice-growing settlements of large villages and small towns that traded with their surroundings as far as China between 500 BCE and 200 CE . Iron Age Burmese cultures also had influences from outside sources such as India and Thailand , as seen in their funerary practices concerning child burials . This indicates some form of communication between groups in Myanmar and other places , possibly through trade .",
      "Early city-states .",
      "Around the second century BCE the first-known city-states emerged in central Myanmar . The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people , the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant , from present-day Yunnan . The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India , importing Buddhism as well as other cultural , architectural and political concepts , which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation .",
      "By the 9th century , several city-states had sprouted across the land : the Pyu in the central dry zone , Mon along the southern coastline and Arakanese along the western littoral . The balance was upset when the Pyu came under repeated attacks from Nanzhao between the 750s and the 830s . In the mid-to-late 9th century the Bamar people founded a small settlement at Bagan . It was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century , when it grew in authority and grandeur .",
      "Pagan Kingdom .",
      "Pagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s\u20131060s when Anawrahta founded the Pagan Kingdom , the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery . In the 12th and 13th centuries , the Pagan Empire and the Khmer Empire were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia . The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley , eclipsing the Pyu , Mon and Pali norms by the late 12th century . Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level , although Tantric , Mahayana , Hinduism , and folk religion remained heavily entrenched . Pagans rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone . Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287 .",
      "Pagans collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century . Like the Burmans four centuries earlier , Shan migrants who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind . Several competing Shan States came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley . The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers , Ava Kingdom and Hanthawaddy Kingdom , emerged . In the west , a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the Kingdom of Mrauk U unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437 . The kingdom was a protectorate of the Bengal Sultanate at different time periods .",
      "In the 14th and 15th centuries , Ava fought wars of unification but could never quite reassemble the lost empire . Having held off Ava , the Mon-speaking Hanthawaddy entered its golden age , and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years . In contrast , constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened , and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward . In 1527 , the Confederation of Shan States conquered Ava and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555 .",
      "Like the Pagan Empire , Ava , Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all multi-ethnic polities . Despite the wars , cultural synchronisation continued . This period is considered a golden age for Burmese culture . Burmese literature grew more confident , popular , and stylistically diverse , and the second generation of Burmese law codes as well as the earliest pan-Burma chronicles emerged . Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country . Many splendid temples of Mrauk U were built during this period .",
      "Taungoo and Konbaung .",
      "Political unification returned in the mid-16th century , through the efforts of Taungoo , a former vassal state of Ava . Taungoos young , ambitious King Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo\u2013Hanthawaddy War . His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states , Lan Na , Manipur , Mong Mao , the Ayutthaya Kingdom , Lan Xang and southern Arakan . However , the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaungs death in 1581 , completely collapsing by 1599 . Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na , and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin ( Syriam ) .",
      "The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614 . It restored a smaller , more manageable kingdom , encompassing Lower Myanmar , Upper Myanmar , Shan states , Lan Na and upper Tenasserim . The restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features continued well into the 19th century . The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs . Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years . From the 1720s onward , the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na . In 1740 , the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom . Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752 , ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty .",
      "After the fall of Ava , the Konbaung\u2013Hanthawaddy War involved one resistance group under Alaungpaya defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy , and by 1759 he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur and driven out the French and the British , who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy . By 1770 , Alaungpayas heirs had subdued much of Laos and fought and won the Burmese\u2013Siamese War against Ayutthaya and the Sino-Burmese War against Qing China .",
      "With Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat , Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770 and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776 . Burma and Siam went to war until 1855 , but all resulted in a stalemate , exchanging Tenasserim ( to Burma ) and Lan Na ( to Ayutthaya ) . Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east , King Bodawpaya turned west , acquiring Arakan ( 1785 ) , Manipur ( 1814 ) and Assam ( 1817 ) . It was the second-largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long ill-defined border with British India .",
      "The breadth of this empire was short-lived . In 1826 , Burma lost Arakan , Manipur , Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the First Anglo-Burmese War . In 1852 , the British easily seized Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War . King Mindon Min tried to modernise the kingdom and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the Karenni States . The British , alarmed by the consolidation of French Indochina , annexed the remainder of the country in the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885 .",
      "Konbaung kings extended Restored Toungoos administrative reforms and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion . For the first time in history , the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley . The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theatre continued , aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era ( half of all males and 5% of females ) . Nonetheless , the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism .",
      "British Burma ( 1885\u20131948 ) .",
      "In the 19th century , Burmese rulers , whose country had not previously been of particular interest to European traders , sought to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam , Manipur and Arakan . Pressing them , however , was the British East India Company , which was expanding its interests eastwards over the same territory . Over the next sixty years , diplomacy , raids , treaties and compromises , known collectively as the Anglo-Burmese Wars , continued until Britain proclaimed control over most of Burma . With the fall of Mandalay , all of Burma came under British rule , being annexed on 1 January 1886 .",
      "Throughout the colonial era , many Indians arrived as soldiers , civil servants , construction workers and traders and , along with the Anglo-Burmese community , dominated commercial and civil life in Burma . Rangoon became the capital of British Burma and an important port between Calcutta and Singapore . Burmese resentment was strong , and was vented in violent riots that paralysed Rangoon on occasion until the 1930s . Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions such as the British refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagodas . Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement . U Wisara , an activist monk , died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike to protest against a rule that forbade him to wear his Buddhist robes while imprisoned .",
      "On 1 April 1937 , Burma became a separately administered colony of Great Britain , and Ba Maw became the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma . Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for Burmese self-rule , and he opposed the participation of Great Britain , and by extension Burma , in World War II . He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition . In 1940 , before Japan formally entered the war , Aung San formed the Burma Independence Army in Japan .",
      "As a major battleground , Burma was devastated during World War II by the Japanese invasion . Within months after they entered the war , Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon , and the British administration had collapsed . A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942 . Wingates British Chindits were formed into long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines . A similar American unit , Merrills Marauders , followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943 . Beginning in late 1944 , allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945 . The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting . Overall , the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma with 1,700 prisoners taken . Although many Burmese fought initially for the Japanese as part of the Burma Independence Army , many Burmese , mostly from the ethnic minorities , served in the British Burma Army . The Burma National Army and the Arakan National Army fought with the Japanese from 1942 to 1944 but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945 . Overall , 170,000 to 250,000 Burmese civilians died during World War II .",
      "Following World War II , Aung San negotiated the Panglong Agreement with ethnic leaders that guaranteed the independence of Myanmar as a unified state . Aung Zan Wai , Pe Khin , Bo Hmu Aung , Sir Maung Gyi , Dr . Sein Mya Maung , Myoma U Than Kywe were among the negotiators of the historic Panglong Conference negotiated with Bamar leader General Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947 . In 1947 , Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Myanmar , a transitional government . But in July 1947 , political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members .",
      "Independence ( 1948\u20131962 ) .",
      "On 4 January 1948 , the nation became an independent republic , under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947 . The new country was named the Union of Burma , with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first president and U Nu as its first prime minister . Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories , Burma did not become a member of the Commonwealth . A bicameral parliament was formed , consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities , and multi-party elections were held in 1951\u20131952 , 1956 and 1960 .",
      "The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement , which combined Burma Proper , which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma , and the Frontier Areas , which had been administered separately by the British .",
      "In 1961 , U Thant , the Union of Burmas Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former secretary to the prime minister , was elected Secretary-General of the United Nations , a position he held for ten years . Among the Burmese to work at the UN when he was secretary-general was Aung San Suu Kyi ( daughter of Aung San ) , who went on to become winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize .",
      "When the non-Burman ethnic groups pushed for autonomy or federalism , alongside having a weak civilian government at the centre , the military leadership staged a coup d\u00e9tat in 1962 . Though incorporated in the 1947 Constitution , successive military governments construed the use of the term federalism as being anti-national , anti-unity and pro-disintegration .",
      "Military rule ( 1962\u20132011 ) .",
      "On 2 March 1962 , the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d\u00e9tat , and the government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then . Between 1962 and 1974 , Myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general . Almost all aspects of society ( business , media , production ) were nationalised or brought under government control under the Burmese Way to Socialism , which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning .",
      "A new constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974 . Until 1988 , the country was ruled as a one-party system , with the general and other military officers resigning and ruling through the Burma Socialist Programme Party ( BSPP ) . During this period , Myanmar became one of the worlds most impoverished countries . There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years , and these were almost always violently suppressed . On 7 July 1962 , the government broke up demonstrations at Rangoon University , killing 15 students . In 1974 , the military violently suppressed anti-government protests at the funeral of U Thant . Student protests in 1975 , 1976 , and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force .",
      "In 1988 , unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the 8888 Uprising . Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators , and General Saw Maung staged a coup d\u00e9tat and formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) . In 1989 , SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests . The military government finalised plans for Peoples Assembly elections on 31 May 1989 . SLORC changed the countrys official English name from the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma to the Union of Myanmar on 18 June 1989 by enacting the adaptation of the expression law .",
      "In May 1990 , the government held free multiparty elections for the first time in almost 30 years , and the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , the party of Aung San Suu Kyi , won earning 392 out of a total 492 seats ( i.e. , 80% of the seats ) . However , the military junta refused to cede power and continued to rule the nation as SLORC until 1997 , and then as the State Peace and Development Council ( SPDC ) until its dissolution in March 2011 . On 23 June 1997 , Myanmar was admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations . On 27 March 2006 , the military junta , which had moved the national capital from Yangon to a site near Pyinmana in November 2005 , officially named the new capital Naypyidaw , meaning city of the kings .",
      "In August 2007 , an increase in the price of fuel led to the Saffron Revolution led by Buddhist monks that were dealt with harshly by the government . The government cracked down on them on 26 September 2007 , with reports of barricades at the Shwedagon Pagoda and monks killed . There were also rumours of disagreement within the Burmese armed forces , but none was confirmed . The military crackdown against unarmed protesters was widely condemned as part of the international reactions to the Saffron Revolution and led to an increase in economic sanctions against the Burmese Government .",
      "In May 2008 , Cyclone Nargis caused extensive damage in the densely populated rice-farming delta of the Irrawaddy Division . It was the worst natural disaster in Burmese history with reports of an estimated 200,000 people dead or missing , damages totalled to 10 billion US dollars , and as many as 1 million were left homeless . In the critical days following this disaster , Myanmars isolationist government was accused of hindering United Nations recovery efforts . Humanitarian aid was requested , but concerns about foreign military or intelligence presence in the country delayed the entry of United States military planes delivering medicine , food , and other supplies .",
      "In early August 2009 , a conflict broke out in Shan State in northern Myanmar . For several weeks , junta troops fought against ethnic minorities including the Han Chinese , Wa , and Kachin . During 8\u201312 August , the first days of the conflict , as many as 10,000 Burmese civilians fled to Yunnan in neighbouring China .",
      "Civil wars .",
      "Civil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmars socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948 . These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy , with the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict . Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmars civil wars continue .",
      "In October 2012 , the ongoing conflicts in Myanmar included the Kachin conflict , between the Pro-Christian Kachin Independence Army and the government ; a civil war between the Rohingya Muslims and the government and non-government groups in Rakhine State ; and a conflict between the Shan , Lahu , and Karen minority groups , and the government in the eastern half of the country . In addition , al-Qaeda signalled an intention to become involved in Myanmar . In a video released on 3 September 2014 , mainly addressed to India , the militant groups leader Ayman al-Zawahiri said al-Qaeda had not forgotten the Muslims of Myanmar and that the group was doing what they can to rescue you . In response , the military raised its level of alertness , while the Burmese Muslim Association issued a statement saying Muslims would not tolerate any threat to their motherland .",
      "Armed conflict between ethnic Chinese rebels and the Myanmar Armed Forces resulted in the Kokang offensive in February 2015 . The conflict had forced 40,000 to 50,000 civilians to flee their homes and seek shelter on the Chinese side of the border . During the incident , the government of China was accused of giving military assistance to the ethnic Chinese rebels . Burmese officials have been historically manipulated and pressured by the Chinese government throughout Burmese modern history to create closer and binding ties with China , creating a Chinese satellite state in Southeast Asia . However , uncertainties exist as clashes between Burmese troops and local insurgent groups continue .",
      "Democratic reforms .",
      "The goal of the Burmese constitutional referendum of 2008 , held on 10 May 2008 , is the creation of a discipline-flourishing democracy . As part of the referendum process , the name of the country was changed from the Union of Myanmar to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar , and general elections were held under the new constitution in 2010 . Observer accounts of the 2010 election describe the event as mostly peaceful ; however , allegations of polling station irregularities were raised , and the United Nations ( UN ) and a number of Western countries condemned the elections as fraudulent .",
      "The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party declared victory in the 2010 elections , stating that it had been favoured by 80 per cent of the votes ; however , the claim was disputed by numerous pro-democracy opposition groups who asserted that the military regime had engaged in rampant fraud . One report documented 77 per cent as the official turnout rate of the election . The military junta was dissolved on 30 March 2011 .",
      "Opinions differ whether the transition to liberal democracy is underway . According to some reports , the militarys presence continues as the label disciplined democracy suggests . This label asserts that the Burmese military is allowing certain civil liberties while clandestinely institutionalising itself further into Burmese politics . Such an assertion assumes that reforms only occurred when the military was able to safeguard its own interests through the transition\u2014here , transition does not refer to a transition to a liberal democracy but transition to a quasi-military rule .",
      "Since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms . The series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest , the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission , the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .",
      "The impact of the post-election reforms has been observed in numerous areas , including ASEANs approval of Myanmars bid for the position of ASEAN chair in 2014 ; the visit by United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in December 2011 for the encouragement of further progress , which was the first visit by a secretary of state in more than fifty years , during which President Bill Clinton met with the Burmese president and former military commander Thein Sein , as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi ; and the participation of Aung San Suu Kyis NLD party in the 2012 by-elections , facilitated by the governments abolition of the laws that previously barred the NLD . In the April 2012 by-elections , the NLD won 43 of the 45 available seats ; previously an illegal organisation , the NLD had not won a single seat under the new constitution . The 2012 by-elections were also the first time that international representatives were allowed to monitor the voting process in Myanmar .",
      "2015 general elections .",
      "General elections were held on 8 November 2015 . These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since the 1990 general election ( which was annulled ) .The results gave the NLD an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the national parliament , enough to ensure that its candidate would become president , while NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency .",
      "The new parliament convened on 1 February 2016 , and on 15 March 2016 , Htin Kyaw was elected as the first non-military president since the military coup of 1962 . On 6 April 2016 , Aung San Suu Kyi assumed the newly created role of state counsellor , a role akin to a prime minister .",

      "Election and aftermath .",
      "In Myanmars 2020 parliamentary election ,",
      "the ostensibly ruling National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , the party of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi , competed with various other smaller parties \u2013 particularly the military-affiliated Union Solidarity and Development Party ( USDP ) . Other parties and individuals allied with specific ethnic minorities also ran for office .",
      "Suu Kyis NLD won the 2020 Myanmar general election on 8 November in a landslide , again winning supermajorities in both houses\u2014winning 396 out of 476 elected seats in parliament .",
      "The USDP , regarded as a proxy for the military , suffered a humiliating defeat \u2013 even worse than in 2015 \u2013 capturing only 33 of the 476 elected seats .",
      "As the election results began emerging , the USDP rejected them , urging a new election with the military as observers .",
      "More than 90 other , smaller parties contested the vote , including more than 15 who complained of irregularities . However , election observers declared there were no major irregularities in the voting .",
      "The military \u2013 arguing that it had found over 8 million irregularities in voter lists , in over 300 townships \u2013 called on Myanmars Union Election Commission ( UEC ) and government to review the results , but the commission dismissed the claims for lack of any evidence .",
      "The election commission declared that any irregularities were too few and too minor to affect the outcome of the election . However , despite the election commission validating the NLDs overwhelming victory , the USDP and Myanmars military persistently alleged fraud and the military threatened to take action .",
      "In January , 2021 , just before the new parliament was to be sworn in , The NLD announced that Suu Kyi would retain her State Counsellor role in the upcoming government .",
      "Coup .",
      "In the early morning of 1 February 2021 , the day parliament was set to convene , the Tatmadaw , Myanmars military , detained State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the ruling party .",
      "The military announced it would replace the current election commission with a new one , and a military media outlet indicated new elections would be held in about one year \u2013 though the military avoided making an official commitment to that .",
      "State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint were placed under house arrest , and the military began filing various charges against them . The military expelled NLD party Members of Parliament from the capital city , Naypyitaw . By March 15 , 2021 the military leadership continued to extend martial law into more parts of Yangon , while security forces killed 38 people in a single day of violence .",
      "Reaction .",
      "By the second day of the coup , thousands of protesters were marching in the streets of the nations largest city , and commercial capital , Yangon , and other protests erupted nationwide , largely halting commerce and transportation . Despite the militarys arrests and killings of protesters , the first weeks of the coup found growing public participation , including groups of civil servants , teachers , students , workers , monks and religious leaders \u2013 even normally disaffected ethnic minorities .",
      "The coup was immediately condemned by the United Nations Secretary General , and leaders of democratic nations \u2013 including the United States President Joe Biden , western European political leaders , Southeast Asian democracies , and others around the world , who demanded or urged release of the captive leaders , and an immediate return to democratic rule in Myanmar . The U.S . threatened sanctions on the military and its leaders , including a freeze of US$1 billion of their assets in the U.S .",
      "Russia and China \u2013 whose representatives had conferred with the Tatmadaw leader Gen . Hlaing just days before the coup \u2013 refrained from criticizing it . Their apparent complicity angered civilian protesters in Myanmar . However , both of those nations refrained from blocking a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the other detained leaders . \u2013 a position shared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights .",
      "International development and aid partners \u2013 business , non-governmental , and governmental \u2013 hinted at suspension of partnerships with Myanmar . Banks closed . Social media communications platforms , including Facebook and Twitter , removed Tatmadaw postings . Protesters appeared at Myanmar embassies in foreign countries .",
      "Geography .",
      "Myanmar has a total area of . It lies between latitudes 9\u00b0 and 29\u00b0N , and longitudes 92\u00b0 and 102\u00b0E . Myanmar is bordered in the northwest by the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh and the Mizoram , Manipur , Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh states of India . Its north and northeast border is with the Tibet Autonomous Region and Yunnan for a Sino-Myanmar border total of . It is bounded by Laos and Thailand to the southeast . Myanmar has of contiguous coastline along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to the southwest and the south , which forms one quarter of its total perimeter .",
      "In the north , the Hengduan Mountains form the border with China . Hkakabo Razi , located in Kachin State , at an elevation of , is the highest point in Myanmar . Many mountain ranges , such as the Rakhine Yoma , the Bago Yoma , the Shan Hills and the Tenasserim Hills exist within Myanmar , all of which run north-to-south from the Himalayas . The mountain chains divide Myanmars three river systems , which are the Irrawaddy , Salween ( Thanlwin ) , and the Sittaung rivers . The Irrawaddy River , Myanmars longest river at nearly , flows into the Gulf of Martaban . Fertile plains exist in the valleys between the mountain chains . The majority of Myanmars population lives in the Irrawaddy valley , which is situated between the Rakhine Yoma and the Shan Plateau .",
      "Administrative divisions .",
      "Myanmar is divided into seven states ( ) and seven regions ( ) , formerly called divisions . Regions are predominantly Bamar ( that is , mainly inhabited by Myanmars dominant ethnic group ) . States , in essence , are regions that are home to particular ethnic minorities . The administrative divisions are further subdivided into districts , which are further subdivided into townships , wards , and villages .",
      "Below are the number of districts , townships , cities/towns , wards , village groups and villages in each division and state of Myanmar as of 31 December 2001 :",
      "Climate .",
      "Much of the country lies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator . It lies in the monsoon region of Asia , with its coastal regions receiving over of rain annually . Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately , while average annual rainfall in the dry zone in central Myanmar is less than . The northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest , with average temperatures of . Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of .",
      "Biodiversity .",
      "Myanmar is a biodiverse country with more than 16,000 plant , 314 mammal , 1131 bird , 293 reptile , and 139 amphibian species , and 64 terrestrial ecosystems including tropical and subtropical vegetation , seasonally inundated wetlands , shoreline and tidal systems , and alpine ecosystems . Myanmar houses some of the largest intact natural ecosystems in Southeast Asia , but the remaining ecosystems are under threat from land use intensification and over-exploitation . According to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories and criteria more than a third of Myanmars land area has been converted to anthropogenic ecosystems over the last 2\u20133 centuries , and nearly half of its ecosystems are threatened . Despite large gaps in information for some ecosystems , there is a large potential to develop a comprehensive protected area network that protects its terrestrial biodiversity .",
      "Myanmar continues to perform badly in the global Environmental Performance Index ( EPI ) with an overall ranking of 153 out of 180 countries in 2016 ; among the worst in the South Asian region , only ahead of Bangladesh and Afghanistan . The EPI was established in 2001 by the World Economic Forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals . The environmental areas where Myanmar performs worst ( i.e . highest ranking ) are air quality ( 174 ) , health impacts of environmental issues ( 143 ) and biodiversity and habitat ( 142 ) . Myanmar performs best ( i.e . lowest ranking ) in environmental impacts of fisheries ( 21 ) but with declining fish stocks . Despite several issues , Myanmar also ranks 64 and scores very good ( i.e . a high percentage of 93.73% ) in environmental effects of the agricultural industry because of an excellent management of the nitrogen cycle . Myanmar is one of the most highly vulnerable countries to climate change ; this poses a number of social , political , economic and foreign policy challenges to the country . The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.18/10 , ranking it 49th globally out of 172 countries .",
      "Myanmars slow economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its environment and ecosystems . Forests , including dense tropical growth and valuable teak in lower Myanmar , cover over 49% of the country , including areas of acacia , bamboo , ironwood and Magnolia champaca . Coconut and betel palm and rubber have been introduced . In the highlands of the north , oak , pine and various rhododendrons cover much of the land .",
      "Heavy logging since the new 1995 forestry law went into effect has seriously reduced forest acreage and wildlife habitat . The lands along the coast support all varieties of tropical fruits and once had large areas of mangroves although much of the protective mangroves have disappeared . In much of central Myanmar ( the dry zone ) , vegetation is sparse and stunted .",
      "Typical jungle animals , particularly tigers , occur sparsely in Myanmar . In upper Myanmar , there are rhinoceros , wild water buffalo , clouded leopard , wild boars , deer , antelope , and elephants , which are also tamed or bred in captivity for use as work animals , particularly in the lumber industry . Smaller mammals are also numerous , ranging from gibbons and monkeys to flying foxes . The abundance of birds is notable with over 800 species , including parrots , myna , peafowl , red junglefowl , weaverbirds , crows , herons , and barn owl . Among reptile species there are crocodiles , geckos , cobras , Burmese pythons , and turtles . Hundreds of species of freshwater fish are wide-ranging , plentiful and are very important food sources .",
      "Climate change .",
      "Previously and currently analysed data , as well as future projections on changes caused by climate change predict serious consequences to development for all economic , productive , social , and environmental sectors in Myanmar . In order to combat the hardships ahead and do its part to help combat climate change Myanmar has displayed interest in expanding its use of renewable energy and lowering its level of carbon emissions . Groups involved in helping Myanmar with the transition and move forward include the UN Environment Programme , Myanmar Climate Change Alliance , and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation which directed in producing the final draft of the Myanmar national climate change policy that was presented to various sectors of the Myanmar government for review .",
      "In April 2015 , it was announced that the World Bank and Myanmar would enter a full partnership framework aimed to better access to electricity and other basic services for about six million people and expected to benefit three million pregnant woman and children through improved health services . Acquired funding and proper planning has allowed Myanmar to better prepare for the impacts of climate change by enacting programs which teach its people new farming methods , rebuild its infrastructure with materials resilient to natural disasters , and transition various sectors towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions .",
      "Government and politics .",
      "Myanmar operates de jure as a unitary assembly-independent republic under its 2008 constitution . But in February 2021 , the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi , was deposed by the Tatmadaw . In February 2021 , Myanmar military declared a one-year state emergency and First Vice President Myint Swe became the Acting President of Myanmar and handed the power to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing and he assumed the role Chairman of the State Administration Council . The President of Myanmar acts as the head of state and the Chairman of the State Administration Council acts as the de facto head of government .",
      "The constitution of Myanmar , its third since independence , was drafted by its military rulers and published in September 2008 . The country is governed as a parliamentary system with a bicameral legislature ( with an executive president accountable to the legislature ) , with 25% of the legislators appointed by the military and the rest elected in general elections .",
      "The legislature , called the Assembly of the Union , is bicameral and made up of two houses : the 224-seat upper House of Nationalities and the 440-seat lower House of Representatives . The upper house consists 168 members who are directly elected and 56 who are appointed by the Burmese Armed Forces . The lower house consists of 330 members who are directly elected and 110 who are appointed by the armed forces .",
      "Political culture .",
      "The major political parties are the National League for Democracy and the Union Solidarity and Development Party .",
      "Myanmars army-drafted constitution was approved in a referendum in May 2008 . The results , 92.4% of the 22 million voters with an official turnout of 99% , are considered suspect by many international observers and by the National League of Democracy with reports of widespread fraud , ballot stuffing , and voter intimidation .",
      "The elections of 2010 resulted in a victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party . Various foreign observers questioned the fairness of the elections . One criticism of the election was that only government-sanctioned political parties were allowed to contest in it and the popular National League for Democracy was declared illegal . However , immediately following the elections , the government ended the house arrest of the democracy advocate and leader of the National League for Democracy , Aung San Suu Kyi , and her ability to move freely around the country is considered an important test of the militarys movement toward more openness . After unexpected reforms in 2011 , NLD senior leaders have decided to register as a political party and to field candidates in future by-elections .",
      "Myanmars political history is underlined by its struggle to establish democratic structures amidst conflicting factions . This political transition from a closely held military rule to a free democratic system is widely believed to be determining the future of Myanmar . The resounding victory of Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy in the 2015 general election raised hope for a successful culmination of this transition .",
      "Myanmar rates as a corrupt nation on the Corruption Perceptions Index with a rank of 130th out of 180 countries worldwide , with 1st being least corrupt , .",
      "Foreign relations .",
      "Though the countrys foreign relations , particularly with Western nations , have historically been strained , the situation has markedly improved since the reforms following the 2010 elections . After years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions , the United States relaxed curbs on foreign aid to Myanmar in November 2011 and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 January 2012 The European Union has placed sanctions on Myanmar , including an arms embargo , cessation of trade preferences , and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid .",
      "Sanctions imposed by the United States and European countries against the former military government , coupled with boycotts and other direct pressure on corporations by supporters of the democracy movement , have resulted in the withdrawal from the country of most U.S . and many European companies . On 13 April 2012 , British Prime Minister David Cameron called for the economic sanctions on Myanmar to be suspended in the wake of the pro-democracy party gaining 43 seats out of a possible 45 in the 2012 by-elections with the party leader , Aung San Suu Kyi becoming a member of the Burmese parliament .",
      "Despite Western isolation , Asian corporations have generally remained willing to continue investing in the country and to initiate new investments , particularly in natural resource extraction . The country has close relations with neighbouring India and China with several Indian and Chinese companies operating in the country . Under Indias Look East policy , fields of co-operation between India and Myanmar include remote sensing , oil and gas exploration , information technology , hydropower and construction of ports and buildings .",
      "In 2008 , India suspended military aid to Myanmar over the issue of human rights abuses by the ruling junta , although it has preserved extensive commercial ties , which provide the regime with much-needed revenue . The thaw in relations began on 28 November 2011 , when Belarusian Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich and his wife Ludmila arrived in the capital , Naypyidaw , the same day as the country received a visit by U.S . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who also met with pro-democracy opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi . International relations progress indicators continued in September 2012 when Aung San Suu Kyi visited the United States followed by Myanmars reformist president visit to the United Nations .",
      "In May 2013 , Thein Sein became the first Myanmar president to visit the White House in 47 years ; the last Burmese leader to visit the White House was Ne Win in September 1966 . President Barack Obama praised the former general for political and economic reforms and the cessation of tensions between Myanmar and the United States . Political activists objected to the visit because of concerns over human rights abuses in Myanmar , but Obama assured Thein Sein that Myanmar will receive U.S . support . The two leaders discussed the release of more political prisoners , the institutionalisation of political reform and the rule of law , and ending ethnic conflict in Myanmar\u2014the two governments agreed to sign a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement on 21 May 2013 .",
      "In June 2013 , Myanmar held its first ever summit , the World Economic Forum on East Asia 2013 . A regional spinoff of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , the summit was held on 5\u20137 June and attended by 1,200 participants , including 10 heads of state , 12 ministers and 40 senior directors from around the world . In July 2019 , UN ambassadors of 37 countries , including Myanmar , have signed a joint letter to the United Nations Human Rights Council defending Chinas treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang region .",
      "Military .",
      "Myanmar has received extensive military aid from China in the past .",
      "Myanmar has been a member of ASEAN since 1997 . Though it gave up its turn to hold the ASEAN chair and host the ASEAN Summit in 2006 , it chaired the forum and hosted the summit in 2014 . In November 2008 , Myanmars political situation with neighbouring Bangladesh became tense as they began searching for natural gas in a disputed block of the Bay of Bengal . Controversy surrounding the Rohingya population also remains an issue between Bangladesh and Myanmar .",
      "Myanmars armed forces are known as the Tatmadaw , which numbers 488,000 . The Tatmadaw comprises the Army , the Navy , and the Air Force . The country ranked twelfth in the world for its number of active troops in service . The military is very influential in Myanmar , with all top cabinet and ministry posts usually held by military officials . Official figures for military spending are not available . Estimates vary widely because of uncertain exchange rates , but Myanmars military forces expenses are high . Myanmar imports most of its weapons from Russia , Ukraine , China and India .",
      "Myanmar is building a research nuclear reactor near Pyin Oo Lwin with help from Russia . It is one of the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation pact since 1992 and a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) since 1957 . The military junta had informed the IAEA in September 2000 of its intention to construct the reactor . In 2010 as part of the Wikileaks leaked cables , Myanmar was suspected of using North Korean construction teams to build a fortified surface-to-air missile facility . As of 2019 , the United States Bureau of Arms Control assessed that Myanmar is not in violation of its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty but that the Myanmar government had a history of non-transparency on its nuclear programs and aims .",
      "Until 2005 , the United Nations General Assembly annually adopted a detailed resolution about the situation in Myanmar by consensus . But in 2006 a divided United Nations General Assembly voted through a resolution that strongly called upon the government of Myanmar to end its systematic violations of human rights . In January 2007 , Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council calling on the government of Myanmar to respect human rights and begin a democratic transition . South Africa also voted against the resolution .",
      "Human rights and internal conflicts .",
      "There is consensus that the former military regime in Myanmar ( 1962\u20132010 ) was one of the worlds most repressive and abusive regimes . In November 2012 , Samantha Power , Barack Obamas Special Assistant to the President on Human Rights , wrote on the White House blog in advance of the presidents visit that Serious human rights abuses against civilians in several regions continue , including against women and children . Members of the United Nations and major international human rights organisations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Myanmar . The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly called on the Burmese military junta to respect human rights and in November 2009 the General Assembly adopted a resolution strongly condemning the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and calling on the Burmese military regime to take urgent measures to put an end to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .",
      "International human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have repeatedly documented and condemned widespread human rights violations in Myanmar . The Freedom in the World 2011 report by Freedom House notes , The military junta has .. . suppressed nearly all basic rights ; and committed human rights abuses with impunity . In July 2013 , the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners indicated that there were approximately 100 political prisoners being held in Burmese prisons . Evidence gathered by a British researcher was published in 2005 regarding the extermination or Burmisation of certain ethnic minorities , such as the Karen , Karenni and Shan .",
      "Based on the evidence gathered by Amnesty photographs and video of the ongoing armed conflict between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army ( AA ) , attacks escalated on civilians in Rakhine State . Ming Yu Hah , Amnesty Internationals Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns said , the UN Security Council must urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court .",
      "Child soldiers .",
      "Child soldiers had played a major part in the Burmese Army until around 2012 . The Independent reported in June 2012 that Children are being sold as conscripts into the Burmese military for as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol . The UNs Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Radhika Coomaraswamy , who stepped down from her position a week later , met representatives of the government of Myanmar in July 2012 and stated that she hoped the governments signing of an action plan would signal a transformation . In September 2012 , the Myanmar Armed Forces released 42 child soldiers , and the International Labour Organization met with representatives of the government as well as the Kachin Independence Army to secure the release of more child soldiers . According to Samantha Power , a U.S . delegation raised the issue of child soldiers with the government in October 2012 . However , she did not comment on the governments progress towards reform in this area .",
      "Slavery and human trafficking .",
      "Forced labour , human trafficking , and child labour are common in Myanmar . The military is also notorious for rampant use of sexual violence . In 2007 the international movement to defend womens human rights issues in Myanmar was said to be gaining speed . Human trafficking happens mostly to women who are unemployed and have low incomes . They are mainly targeted or deceived by brokers into making them believe that better opportunities and wages exist for them abroad . In 2017 , the government reported investigating 185 trafficking cases . The government of Burma makes little effort to eliminate human trafficking . Burmese armed forces compel troops to acquire labour and supplies from local communities . The U.S . State Department reported that both the government and Tatmadaw were complicit in sex and labour trafficking . Women and girls from all ethnic groups and foreigners have been victims of sex trafficking in Myanmar . They are forced into prostitution , marriages , and or pregnancies .",
      "Genocide allegations and crimes against Rohingya people .",
      "The Rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens ( despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations ) \u2014the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law . The law created three categories of citizenship : citizenship , associate citizenship , and naturalised citizenship . Citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races such as Kachin , Kayah ( Karenni ) , Karen , Chin , Burman , Mon , Rakhine , Shan , Kaman , or Zerbadee . Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823 but can prove they have one grandparent , or pre-1823 ancestor , who was a citizen of another country , as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws . Naturalised citizenship is only given to those who have at least one parent with one of these types of Burmese citizenship or can provide conclusive evidence that their parents entered and resided in Burma prior to independence in 1948 . The Burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel Rohingya and bring in non-Rohingyas to replace them\u2014this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000 Rohingya from Burma , while the Rohingya people have been described as among the worlds least wanted and one of the worlds most persecuted minorities . But the origin of the most persecuted minority statement is unclear .",
      "Rohingya are not allowed to travel without official permission , are banned from owning land , and are required to sign a commitment to have no more than two children . As of July 2012 , the Myanmar government does not include the Rohingya minority group\u2014classified as stateless Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982\u2014on the governments list of more than 130 ethnic races and , therefore , the government states that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship .",
      "In 2007 German professor Bassam Tibi suggested that the Rohingya conflict may be driven by an Islamist political agenda to impose religious laws , while non-religious causes have also been raised , such as a lingering resentment over the violence that occurred during the Japanese occupation of Burma in World War II\u2014during this time period the British allied themselves with the Rohingya and fought against the puppet government of Burma ( composed mostly of Bamar Japanese ) that helped to establish the Tatmadaw military organisation that remains in power as of March 2013 .",
      "Since the democratic transition began in 2011 , there has been continuous violence as 280 people have been killed and 140,000 forced to flee from their homes in the Rakhine state . A UN envoy reported in March 2013 that unrest had re-emerged between Myanmars Buddhist and Muslim communities , with violence spreading to towns that are located closer to Yangon .",
      "Government reforms .",
      "According to the Crisis Group , since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011 , the countrys human rights record has been improving . Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7 , the 2012 Freedom in the World report also notes improvement , giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights , the release of political prisoners , and a loosening of restrictions . In 2013 , Myanmar improved yet again , receiving a score of 5 in civil liberties and 6 in political freedoms .",
      "The government has assembled a National Human Rights Commission that consists of 15 members from various backgrounds . Several activists in exile , including Thee Lay Thee Anyeint members , have returned to Myanmar after President Thein Seins invitation to expatriates to return home to work for national development . In an address to the United Nations Security Council on 22 September 2011 , Myanmars Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin confirmed the governments intention to release prisoners in the near future .",
      "The government has also relaxed reporting laws , but these remain highly restrictive . In September 2011 , several banned websites , including YouTube , Democratic Voice of Burma and Voice of America , were unblocked . A 2011 report by the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations found that , while contact with the Myanmar government was constrained by donor restrictions , international humanitarian non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) see opportunities for effective advocacy with government officials , especially at the local level . At the same time , international NGOs are mindful of the ethical quandary of how to work with the government without bolstering or appeasing it .",
      "Following Thein Seins first ever visit to the UK and a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron , the Myanmar president declared that all of his nations political prisoners will be released by the end of 2013 , in addition to a statement of support for the well-being of the Rohingya Muslim community . In a speech at Chatham House , he revealed that We [ Myanmar government ] are reviewing all cases . I guarantee to you that by the end of this year , there will be no prisoners of conscience in Myanmar. , in addition to expressing a desire to strengthen links between the UK and Myanmars military forces .",
      "Homosexual acts are illegal in Myanmar and can be punishable by life imprisonment .",
      "In 2016 , Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmars Muslim minority . Since August 2017 Doctors Without Borders have treated 113 Rohingya refugee females for sexual assault with all but one describing military assailants .",

      "Myanmars economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a nominal GDP of US$76.09 billion in 2019 and an estimated purchasing power adjusted GDP of US$327.629 billion in 2017 according to the World Bank . Foreigners are able to legally lease but not own property . In December 2014 , Myanmar set up its first stock exchange , the Yangon Stock Exchange .",
      "The informal economys share in Myanmar is one of the biggest in the world and is closely linked to corruption , smuggling and illegal trade activities . In addition , decades of civil war and unrest have contributed to Myanmars current levels of poverty and lack of economic progress . Myanmar lacks adequate infrastructure . Goods travel primarily across the Thai border ( where most illegal drugs are exported ) and along the Irrawaddy River .",
      "Both China and India have attempted to strengthen ties with the government for economic benefit in the early 2010s . Many Western nations , including the United States and Canada , and the European Union , historically imposed investment and trade sanctions on Myanmar . The United States and European Union eased most of their sanctions in 2012 . From May 2012 to February 2013 , the United States began to lift its economic sanctions on Myanmar in response to the historic reforms that have been taking place in that country . Foreign investment comes primarily from China , Singapore , the Philippines , South Korea , India , and Thailand . The military has stakes in some major industrial corporations of the country ( from oil production and consumer goods to transportation and tourism ) .",
      "Economic history .",
      "Under the British administration , the people of Burma were at the bottom of the social hierarchy , with Europeans at the top , Indians , Chinese , and Christianized minorities in the middle , and Buddhist Burmese at the bottom . Forcefully integrated into the world economy , Burmas economy grew in extractive industries and cash crops agriculture ; much of the wealth was concentrated in the hands of Europeans , however . The country became the worlds largest exporter of rice , mainly to European markets , while other colonies like India suffered mass starvation . The British followed the ideologies of Social Darwinism and the free market , and opened up the country to large-scale immigration with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world in the 1920s . Historian Thant Myint-U states , This was out of a total population of only 13 million ; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year . By then , in most of the largest cities in Burma , Rangoon , Akyab , Bassein and Moulmein , the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population . The Burmese under British rule felt helpless , and reacted with a racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear .",
      "Crude oil production , an indigenous industry of Yenangyaung , was taken over by the British and put under Burmah Oil monopoly . British Burma began exporting crude oil in 1853 . It produced 75% of the worlds teak . The wealth was however , mainly concentrated in the hands of Europeans . In the 1930s , agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices declined and did not recover for several decades .",
      "During the Japanese invasion of Burma in World War II , the British followed a scorched earth policy . They destroyed the major government buildings , oil wells and mines for tungsten , tin , lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese . Myanmar was bombed extensively by the Allies . After independence , the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed . With the loss of India , Burma lost relevance and obtained independence from the British . After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948 , Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land . The government tried to implement an eight-year plan partly financed by injecting money into the economy which caused some inflation .",
      "The 1962 coup d\u00e9tat was followed by an economic scheme called the Burmese Way to Socialism , a plan to nationalise all industries , with the exception of agriculture . While the economy continued to grow at a slower rate , the country eschewed a Western-oriented development model , and by the 1980s , was left behind capitalist powerhouses like Singapore which were integrated into Western economy . Myanmar asked for admittance to a least developed country status in 1987 to receive debt relief .",
      "Agriculture .",
      "The major agricultural product is rice , which covers about 60% of the countrys total cultivated land area . Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight . Through collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997 , helping increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to 19 million tons in 1996 . By 1988 , modern varieties were planted on half of the countrys ricelands , including 98 per cent of the irrigated areas . In 2008 rice production was estimated at 50 million tons .",
      "Extractive industries .",
      "Myanmar produces precious stones such as rubies , sapphires , pearls , and jade . Rubies are the biggest earner ; 90% of the worlds rubies come from the country , whose red stones are prized for their purity and hue . Thailand buys the majority of the countrys gems . Myanmars Valley of Rubies , the mountainous Mogok area , north of Mandalay , is noted for its rare pigeons blood rubies and blue sapphires .",
      "Many U.S . and European jewellery companies , including Bulgari , Tiffany and Cartier , refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines . Human Rights Watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of Burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta , as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run . The government of Myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines .",
      "Other industries include agricultural goods , textiles , wood products , construction materials , gems , metals , oil and natural gas . Myanmar Engineering Society has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to Yangon which is a significant underutilised resource for electrical production .",
      "Tourism .",
      "The government receives a significant percentage of the income of private-sector tourism services . The most popular available tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as Yangon and Mandalay ; religious sites in Mon State , Pindaya , Bago and Hpa-An ; nature trails in Inle Lake , Kengtung , Putao , Pyin Oo Lwin ; ancient cities such as Bagan and Mrauk-U ; as well as beaches in Nabule , Ngapali , Ngwe-Saung , Mergui . Nevertheless , much of the country is off-limits to tourists , and interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar , particularly in the border regions , are subject to police scrutiny . They are not to discuss politics with foreigners , under penalty of imprisonment and , in 2001 , the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit unnecessary contact between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people .",
      "The most common way for travellers to enter the country is by air . According to the website Lonely Planet , getting into Myanmar is problematic : No bus or train service connects Myanmar with another country , nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border \u2013 you must walk across . They further state that It is not possible for foreigners to go to/from Myanmar by sea or river . There are a few border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles , such as the border between Ruili ( China ) to Mu-se , the border between Htee Kee ( Myanmar ) and Phu Nam Ron ( Thailand ) \u2014the most direct border between Dawei and Kanchanaburi , and the border between Myawaddy and Mae Sot , Thailand . At least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland routes through these borders since 2013 .",
      "Flights are available from most countries , though direct flights are limited to mainly Thai and other ASEAN airlines . According to Eleven magazine , In the past , there were only 15 international airlines and increasing numbers of airlines have begun launching direct flights from Japan , Qatar , Taiwan , South Korea , Germany and Singapore . Expansions were expected in September 2013 but are mainly Thai and other Asian-based airlines .",
      "Society .",
      "Demographics .",
      "The provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census show that the total population is 51,419,420 . This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State , Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted . People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures . There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand , and millions more work illegally . Burmese citizens account for 80% of all migrant workers in Thailand . The national population density is , among the lowest in Southeast Asia .",
      "Myanmars fertility rate is 2.23 , which is slightly above replacement level and is low compared to Southeast Asian countries of similar economic standing , such as Cambodia ( 3.18 ) and Laos ( 4.41 ) . There has been a significant decline in fertility in the 2000s , from a rate of 4.7 children per woman in 1983 , down to 2.4 in 2001 , despite the absence of any national population policy . The fertility rate is much lower in urban areas .",
      "The relatively rapid decline in fertility is attributed to several factors , including extreme delays in marriage ( almost unparalleled among developing countries in the region ) , the prevalence of illegal abortions , and the high proportion of single , unmarried women of reproductive age , with 25.9% of women aged 30\u201334 and 33.1% of men and women aged 25\u201334 being single .",
      "These patterns stem from economic dynamics , including high income inequality , which results in residents of reproductive age opting for delay of marriage and family-building in favour of attempting to find employment and establish some form of wealth ; the average age of marriage in Myanmar is 27.5 for men , 26.4 for women .",
      "Ethnic groups .",
      "Myanmar is ethnically diverse . The government recognises 135 distinct ethnic groups . There are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar , consisting mainly of distinct Tibeto-Burman peoples , but with sizeable populations of Tai\u2013Kadai , Hmong\u2013Mien , and Austroasiatic ( Mon\u2013Khmer ) peoples .",
      "The Bamar form an estimated 68% of the population . 10% of the population are Shan . The Kayin make up 7% of the population . The Rakhine people constitute 4% of the population . Overseas Chinese form approximately 3% of the population . Myanmars ethnic minority groups prefer the term ethnic nationality over ethnic minority as the term minority furthers their sense of insecurity in the face of what is often described as Burmanisation\u2014the proliferation and domination of the dominant Bamar culture over minority cultures .",
      "Mon , who form 2% of the population , are ethno-linguistically related to the Khmer . Overseas Indians are 2% . The remainder are Kachin , Chin , Rohingya , Anglo-Indians , Gurkha , Nepali and other ethnic minorities . Included in this group are the Anglo-Burmese . Once forming a large and influential community , the Anglo-Burmese left the country in steady streams from 1958 onwards , principally to Australia and the United Kingdom . It is estimated that 52,000 Anglo-Burmese remain in Myanmar . , 110,000 Burmese refugees were living in refugee camps in Thailand .",
      "Refugee camps exist along Indian , Bangladeshi and Thai borders while several thousand are in Malaysia . Conservative estimates state that there are over 295,800 minority refugees from Myanmar , with the majority being Rohingya , Karen , and Karenni are principally located along the Thai-Myanmar border . There are nine permanent refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border , most of which were established in the mid-1980s . The refugee camps are under the care of the Thai-Burma Border Consortium ( TBBC ) . Since 2006 , over 55,000 Burmese refugees have been resettled in the United States .",
      "The persecution of Burmese Indians , Burmese Chinese and other ethnic groups after the military coup headed by General Ne Win in 1962 led to the expulsion or emigration of 300,000 people . They migrated to escape racial discrimination and the wholesale nationalisation of private enterprise that took place in 1964 . The Anglo-Burmese at this time either fled the country or changed their names and blended in with the broader Burmese society .",
      "Many Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar . Many refugees headed to neighbouring Bangladesh , including 200,000 in 1978 as a result of the King Dragon operation in Arakan . 250,000 more left in 1991 .",
      "Languages .",
      "Myanmar is home to four major language families : Sino-Tibetan , Tai\u2013Kadai , Austro-Asiatic , and Indo-European . Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken . They include Burmese , Karen , Kachin , Chin , and Chinese ( mainly Hokkien ) . The primary Tai\u2013Kadai language is Shan . Mon , Palaung , and Wa are the major Austroasiatic languages spoken in Myanmar . The two major Indo-European languages are Pali , the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism , and English . More than a hundred languages are spoken in total . Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country , they may have been lost ( many if not all ) after a few generations .",
      "Burmese , the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Myanmar , is related to Tibetan and Chinese . It is written in a script consisting of circular and semi-circular letters , which were adapted from the Mon script , which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 5th century . The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century . It is also used to write Pali , the sacred language of Theravada Buddhism , as well as several ethnic minority languages , including Shan , several Karen dialects , and Kayah ( Karenni ) , with the addition of specialised characters and diacritics for each language .",
      "The Burmese language incorporates widespread usage of honorifics and is age-oriented . Burmese society has traditionally stressed the importance of education . In villages , secular schooling often takes place in monasteries . Secondary and tertiary education take place at government schools .",
      "Religion .",
      "Many religions are practised in Myanmar . Religious edifices and orders have been in existence for many years . The Christian and Muslim populations do , however , face religious persecution and it is hard , if not impossible , for non-Buddhists to join the army or get government jobs , the main route to success in the country . Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in eastern Myanmar , where over 3,000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years . More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to Bangladesh over the last 20 years to escape persecution .",
      "A large majority of the population practices Buddhism ; estimates range from 80% to 89% . According to 2014 Myanmar Census , 87.9% of the population identifies as Buddhists . Therav\u0101da Buddhism is the most widespread . There are some 500,000 Buddhist monks and 75,000 nuns in this country of 54 million . Other religions are practised largely without obstruction , with the notable exception of some religious minorities such as the Rohingya people , who have continued to have their citizenship status denied and treated as illegal immigrants instead , and Christians in Chin State .",
      "According to 2014 census , 6.2% of the population identifies as Christian ; 4.3% as Muslim ; 0.8% as followers of tribal religions ; 0.5% as Hindus ; 0.2% as followers of other religions ; and 0.1% follow no religion . According to the 2010 estimates of the Pew Research Center , 7% of the population is Christian ; 4% is Muslim ; 1% follows traditional animistic beliefs ; and 2% follow other religions , including Mahayana Buddhism , Hinduism , and East Asian religions . Jehovahs Witnesses have been present since 1914 and have about 80 congregations around the country and a branch office in Yangon publishing in 16 languages .",
      "A tiny Jewish community in Yangon had a synagogue but no resident rabbi to conduct services .",
      "Although Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the population , it was a major religion in Myanmars past . Several strains of Hinduism existed alongside both Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism in the Mon and Pyu period in the first millennium , and down to the Pagan period ( 9th to 13th centuries ) when Saivite and Vaishana elements enjoyed greater elite influence than they would later do . Burmese folk religion is practised by many Bamars alongside Buddhism .",
      "Health .",
      "The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor . The government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the countrys GDP on health care , consistently ranking among the lowest in the world . Although health care is nominally free , in reality , patients have to pay for medicine and treatment , even in public clinics and hospitals . Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment . The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Myanmar is 240 . This is compared with 219.3 in 2008 and 662 in 1990 . The under 5 mortality rate , per 1,000 births is 73 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5s mortality is 47 . According to the report named Preventable Fate , published by Doctors without Borders , 25,000 Burmese AIDS patients died in 2007 , deaths that could largely have been prevented by antiretroviral therapy drugs and proper treatment .",
      "HIV/AIDS , recognised as a disease of concern by the Burmese Ministry of Health , is most prevalent among sex workers and intravenous drug users . In 2005 , the estimated adult HIV prevalence rate in Myanmar was 1.3% ( 200,000\u2013570,000 people ) , according to UNAIDS , and early indicators of any progress against the HIV epidemic are inconsistent . However , the National AIDS Programme Myanmar found that 32% of sex workers and 43% of intravenous drug users in Myanmar have HIV .",
      "Education .",
      "According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics , Myanmars official literacy rate as of 2000 was 90% . Historically , Myanmar has had high literacy rates . The educational system of Myanmar is operated by the government agency , the Ministry of Education . The education system is based on the United Kingdoms system after nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Myanmar . Nearly all schools are government-operated , but there has been an increase in privately funded English language schools in the early 21st century . Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school , approximately about 9 years old , while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level .",
      "There are 101 universities , 12 institutes , 9 degree colleges and 24 colleges in Myanmar , a total of 146 higher education institutions . There are 10 technical training schools , 23 nursing training schools , 1 sport academy and 20 midwifery schools . There are four international schools acknowledged by WASC and College Board\u2014The International School Yangon , Myanmar International School , Yangon International School , and International School of Myanmar in Yangon .",
      "Crime .",
      "Myanmar had a murder rate of 15.2 per 100,000 population with a total of 8,044 murders in 2012 . Factors influencing Myanmars high murder rate include communal violence and armed conflict . Myanmar is one of the worlds most corrupt nations . The 2012 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ranked the country at number 171 , out of 176 countries in total . Myanmar is the worlds second largest producer of opium after Afghanistan , producing some 25% of the worlds opium , and forms part of the Golden Triangle . The opium industry was a monopoly during colonial times and has since been illegally operated by corrupt officials in the Burmese military and rebel fighters , primarily as the basis for heroin manufacture . Myanmar is the largest producer of methamphetamines in the world , with the majority of Ya ba found in Thailand produced in Myanmar , particularly in the Golden Triangle and northeastern Shan State , which borders Thailand , Laos and China . Burmese-produced ya ba is typically trafficked to Thailand via Laos , before being transported through the northeastern Thai region of Isan .",
      "Culture .",
      "A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar , with majority culture primarily Buddhist and Bamar . Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries , manifested in its language , cuisine , music , dance and theatre . The arts , particularly literature , have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism . Considered the national epic of Myanmar , the Yama Zatdaw , an adaptation of Indias Ramayana , has been influenced greatly by Thai , Mon , and Indian versions of the play . Buddhism is practised along with nat worship , which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats .",
      "In a traditional village , the monastery is the centre of cultural life . Monks are venerated and supported by the lay people . A novitiation ceremony called shinbyu is the most important coming of age events for a boy , during which he enters the monastery for a short time . All male children in Buddhist families are encouraged to be a novice ( beginner for Buddhism ) before the age of twenty and to be a monk after the age of twenty . Girls have ear-piercing ceremonies ( ) at the same time . Burmese culture is most evident in villages where local festivals are held throughout the year , the most important being the pagoda festival . Many villages have a guardian nat , and superstition and taboos are commonplace .",
      "British colonial rule introduced Western elements of culture to Myanmar . Myanmars education system is modelled after that of the United Kingdom . Colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as Yangon . Many ethnic minorities , particularly the Karen in the southeast and the Kachin and Chin who populate the north and northeast , practice Christianity . According to The World Factbook , the Burman population is 68% and the ethnic groups constitute 32% . In contrast , the exiled leaders and organisations claim the country is 40% ethnic .",
      "Cuisine .",
      "Burmese cuisine is characterised by extensive use of fish products such as fish sauce , ngapi ( fermented seafood ) and dried prawn . Mohinga is the traditional breakfast dish and is Myanmars national dish . Seafood is a common ingredient in coastal cities , while meat and poultry are more commonly used in landlocked cities like Mandalay . Freshwater fish and shrimp have been incorporated into inland cooking as a primary source of protein and are used in a variety of ways , fresh , salted whole or filleted , salted and dried , made into a salty paste , or fermented sour and pressed . Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads ( a thoke ) , centred on one major ingredient , ranging from starches like rice , wheat and rice noodles , glass noodles and vermicelli , to potato , ginger , tomato , kaffir lime , long bean , and lahpet ( pickled tea leaves ) .",
      "Sport .",
      "The Lethwei , Bando , Banshay , and Pongyi thaing martial arts and chinlone are traditional sports in Myanmar . Football is played all over the country , even in villages , and its national team is ruled by the Myanmar Football Federation . The 2013 Southeast Asian Games took place in Naypyidaw , Yangon , Mandalay and Ngwesaung Beach in December representing the third occasion that the event has been staged in Myanmar . Myanmar previously hosted the games in 1961 and 1969 .",
      "Art .",
      "Burmese traditional art concepts are popular and respected by the Burmese people and people from abroad . Burmese contemporary art has developed quite rapidly on its own terms . Artists born after the 1980s have had greater chances of art practice outside the country .",
      "One of the first to study western art was Ba Nyan . Together with Ngwe Gaing and a handful of other artists , they were the pioneers of western painting style . Later on most young children learned the concepts from them . Some well known contemporary artists are Lun Gywe , Aung Kyaw Htet , MPP Yei Myint , Myint Swe , Min Wai Aung , Aung Myint , Kin Maung Yin , Po Po and Zaw Zaw Aung .",
      "Media and communications .",
      "Because of Myanmars political climate , there are not many media companies in relation to the countrys population . Some are privately owned . All programming must meet with the approval of the censorship board . The Burmese government announced on 20 August 2012 that it would stop censoring media before publication . Following the announcement , newspapers and other outlets no longer required approved by state censors ; however , journalists in the country can still face consequences for what they write and say . In April 2013 , international media reports were published to relay the enactment of the media liberalisation reforms that we announced in August 2012 . For the first time in numerous decades , the publication of privately owned newspapers commenced in the country .",
      "Internet .",
      "Internet use is estimated to be relatively low compared to other countries . Myanmars internet used to be subject to censorship , and authorities viewed e-mails and posts on Internet blogs until 2012 when the government removed media censorship . During the strict censorship days , activity at internet cafes was regulated , and one blogger named Zarganar was sentenced to prison for publishing a video of destruction caused by Cyclone Nargis in 2008 ; Zarganar was released in October 2011 .",
      "In regards to communications infrastructure , Myanmar is the last ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forums Network Readiness Index ( NRI ) \u2013 an indicator for determining the development level of a countrys information and communication technologies . With 139 countries reported on , Myanmar ranked number 133 overall in the 2016 NRI ranking .",
      "Film .",
      "Myanmars first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein\u2014a leading politician of the 1910s , who campaigned for Burmese independence in London . The first Burmese silent film Myitta Ne Thuya ( Love and Liquor ) in 1920 which proved a major success , despite its poor quality due to a fixed camera position and inadequate film accessories . During the 1920s and 1930s , many Burmese-owned film companies made and produced several films . The first Burmese sound film was produced in 1932 in Bombay , India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya ( Money Cant Buy It ) . After World War II , Burmese cinema continued to address political themes . Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element to them .",
      "In the era that followed the political events of 1988 , the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government . Film stars who had been involved in the political activities were banned from appearing in films . The government issues strict rules on censorship and largely determines who produces films , as well as who gets academy awards .",
      "Over the years , the movie industry has also shifted to producing many lower-budget direct-to-video films . Most of the movies produced nowadays are comedies . In 2008 , only 12 films worthy of being considered for an Academy Award were made , although at least 800 VCDs were produced . Myanmar is the primary subject of a 2007 graphic novel titled Chroniques Birmanes by Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois author and animator , Guy Delisle . The graphic novel was translated into English under the title Burma Chronicles in 2008 . In 2009 , a documentary about Burmese videojournalists called Burma VJ was released . This film was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 2010 Academy Awards . The Lady had its world premiere on 12 September 2011 at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival ."

      "Maidan Nezalezhnosti",
      "Maidan Nezalezhnosti ( , literally Independence Square ) is the central square of Kyiv , the capital city of Ukraine . One of the citys main squares , it is located on Khreshchatyk Street in the Shevchenko Raion . The square has been known under many different names , but often it is called simply Maidan ( square ) .",
      "In the 19th century , the square contained buildings of the city council and noble assembly .",
      "Since the start of Ukraines independence movement in 1990 , the square has been the traditional place for political rallies , including four large-scale radical protest campaigns : the 1990 student Revolution on Granite , the 2001 Ukraine without Kuchma , the 2004 Orange Revolution , and the 2013\u201314 Euromaidan . Maidan is also a regular site for non-political displays and events , however since 2014 most of them were moved to Sofiyivska Square or elsewhere , because making entertainment on a place where people were killed during Euromaidan was considered inappropriate . Most notably , Christmas Fairs and New Year celebrations were moved to Sofiyivska Square .",
      "Names .",
      "The square received its current name in 1991 , in the aftermath of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine and the collapse of the Soviet Union .",
      "Maidan is a Ukrainian word for square , open space , with widely used equivalents in the Middle East and South Asia to refer to an open space in or near a town , used as a parade ground or for events such as public meetings . It has similar forms in Urdu ( maid\u0101n ) , and its source , Persian ( meyd\u00e2n , town-square or central place of gathering ) , from Arabic ( mayd\u0101n ) , itself an Iranian borrowing ultimately from Proto-Indo-European . Compare Avestan , Sanskrit ( madhya ) and Latin . The word also was borrowed into neighboring Turkic languages , as in the Crimean Tatar and Turkish , which are the likely sources of the borrowing into Ukrainian .",
      "Maidan Nezalezhnosti is the only square in Kyiv officially designated as a Maidan in Ukrainian . All remain designated as a Ploscha ( ploshcha , a more common Ukrainian equivalent of square ) since the Soviet epoch .",
      "Timeline of the squares names :",

      "City squares called Maidan Nezalezhnosti are also found in Khmelnytskyi and Sumy .",
      "Kropyvnytskyi , Kremenchuk and Odesa have Independent Squares named Ploshcha Nezalezhnosti ( using ploshcha rather than maidan for square ) .",
      "Location .",
      "Independence Square is one of three squares located along Khreshchatyk , close to the northeastern end of the street . It is situated close to European Square , which is the terminal end of Khreshchatyk . Besides Khreshchatyk , which splits the square in half , several other streets lead to the square . These include Architect Horodecki Street , Institute Street , Michael Street , Kosciol Street , Minor Zhytomyr Street , Sophia Street , Taras Shevchenko Lane , and Boris Hrinchenko Street .",
      "The square itself is a multi-level location . At ground level is the intersection of Khreshchatyk , which splits Institute Street ( vulytsia Instytutska ) , and Michael Street ( vulytsia Mykhailivska ) . Underneath the square , the Obolonsko\u2013Teremkivska line of the Kyiv Metro stretches across with its station Maidan Nezalezhnosti located underground . Also the Hlobus mall is situated underneath the square .",
      "History .",
      "Early history and Tsarist Russia .",
      "Until the 10th century , the future squares site , as well as the rest of Khreshchatyk , was called Perevisyshch . It was located just to the south of the Kyiv City , beyond which were located territories of the Cave Monastery ( Kyiv-Pechersky ) along the Dnipro River .",
      "At the lower end of Sofiivska vulytsia ( Sofia Street ) , which led to the High City , stood one of the three main gates of Old Kyiv ( Yaroslavs City ) , the Lyadski Gates ; the other two were the Golden Gates and Zhydivski Gates . Those gates are also mentioned in 1151 , and around them lived the Polish population of the city , Lacka Sloboda . The Lyadksi Gates were destroyed during the storm of city by the Mongol army of Batu Khan in 1240 .",
      "Sometime during the 18th century , the new Pecherski Gates were erected ; they stood until 1833 . Until the early 19th century , the area was a low-lying vacant ground known as Goat Swamp ( Kozyne Boloto ) .",
      "In the 1830s , the first wooden dwellings were built on the site , and in the 1850s stone buildings appeared . The most famous Ukrainian writer , Taras Shevchenko lived in that area in 1859 , in a building between Mala Zhytomyrska ( Little Zhytomyr ) and Mykhailivska vulytsia ( Michaels Street ) .",
      "Development rapidly intensified after the mid-19th century , when the territory gradually became the commercial center of Kyiv , which underwent an immense boom during the Russian Industrial Revolution , becoming the third most important city in the Russian Empire . Until 1871 , it was called the Khreshchatitskaya Ploshchad ( Khreshchatyk Square ) ; it was a location for the local market and folk entertainment . In 1876 , the Kyiv City Duma building was built here , and the area became known as the Dumskaya Ploshchad ( Duma Square ) . A line from the Kyiv tram , the first electric tram built in the Russian Empire ( opened 1892 ) reached the square in 1894 .",
      "In 1913 , in front of the City Duma , a monument of Pyotr Stolypin ( who was assassinated in Kyiv in 1911 ) was constructed , and it stood there until March 1917 at the dawn of the Revolutionary war within the Empire .",
      "Soviet prewar years .",
      "In 1919 , the square was renamed Soviet Square . From 1935 , it was called Kalinin Square , after Mikhail Kalinin , the first chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR .",
      "Soviet postwar years .",
      "During the first couple of years after the war , the square was completely rebuilt from scratch . It was architecturally integrated with the newly constructed Khreshchatyk in the typical ( for the time ) neo-classical Stalinist architecture . The newly constructed Kyiv Central Post Office and Trade-Union House with its high-rise clock located in the square , is very well known and frequently appears in pictures of the center of the city .",
      "In 1976-77 , as a part of metro construction , much of the square was again rebuilt , and it was renamed October Revolution Square ( Ploshcha Zhovtnevoyi revolyutsii ) . During the reconstruction , the massive cubist monument to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution was put up as was the complex ensemble of fountains .",
      "During the Soviet period , the square was used for demonstrations and parades in honor of May 1 ( until 1969 ) , Victory Day and the October Revolution .",
      "Independent Ukraine .",
      "After Ukraines independence in 1991 , the square was given its current name . The competing proposal of Liberty Square ( Ploshcha Svobody ) was raised at the time as well as in the years to follow , but the current name commemorating the Ukrainian independence is now firmly associated with the square ( see the section below ) .",
      "In 2001 , as the square was the major center of the Ukraine without Kuchma mass protest campaign , the new extensive construction of the area was abruptly ordered by the Kyiv mayor of the time , Oleksandr Omelchenko . The square was fenced off for construction and became inaccessible for the protesters and many observers claimed that the main goal of the project ordered by the city mayor was to disrupt the",
      "protests , especially since similar tactics were commonly used by local authorities throughout Ukraine .",
      "Following the construction , the old familiar look of the square , with its many fountains , was significantly altered and the public reaction to the new look of the square was mixed at first . However , by now the squares monument to Kyi , Shchek and Khoryv , the legendary founders of Kyiv , the folklore hero Cossack Mamay , the citys historic protector Archangel Michael as well as a more modern invention , the protecting goddess Berehynia , and the many glass domes are easily recognisable as parts of the modern city centre .",
      "A mostly underground shopping mall called Hlobus was built under the square to replace the old and shabby giant underpass formerly dubbed by Kyivans as Truba ( the Tube ) .",
      "Trade-Unions House was severely damaged during the fire in February 2014 , so later it went through a reconstruction .",
      "Future developments of the square include the demolition of the old Ukrayina hotel ( formerly hotel Moskva ) , and building a new 68-floor building instead .",
      "Symbol of political activity .",
      "As the central Kyiv square , following the end of Soviet era the Maidan has been the centre of public political activity . In the autumn of 1990 , students protests and hunger strikes also known as the Revolution on Granite at the Maidan resulted in the resignation of the Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR Vitaliy Masol .",
      "In the 2000s , the biggest political protests in Ukraine , such as the Ukraine without Kuchma campaign and the Orange Revolution took place in this square . During the Orange Revolution in late 2004 , Maidan Nezalezhnosti received global media coverage , as hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in the square and nearby streets , and pitched tents for several weeks , enduring the cold and snow . One of the eminent activists during that time became Paraska Korolyuk . The protests against electoral fraud resulted in an additional round of presidential elections being ordered by the Supreme Court of Ukraine , which were won by the opposition candidate , Viktor Yushchenko .",
      "Following his election as the President of Ukraine , and after taking the official oath in the parliament , Yushchenko took a public oath at Maidan Nezalezhnosti in front of his numerous supporters .",
      "After the Orange Revolution , Maidan Nezalezhnosti continues to attract political protesters , but no protest related event has ever approached the scale of the Orange protests . Mass rallies for political candidates , however , have attracted large numbers , with the 2009 Batkivshchyna party congress ( during which Yulia Tymoshenko was nominated as a candidate for president ) being a notable example that brought nearly 200,000 people to the square .",
      "The square was the site of Euromaidan protests beginning in November 2013 , progressing to violent clashes , fires , and ending in the February 2014 Ukrainian revolution . The square was covered in protesters all day and night since 1 December 2013 . On 27 January 2014 , Ukrainian police reported a 55-year-old man from Western Ukraine found dead hanging from the framework of a huge artificial New Year tree in central Kyiv . The body was found hanging inside the cone-shaped tubular steel construction on Kyivs Independence Square . The tree , which had become a symbol of anti-government resistance , was at that time decorated with a poster of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and scrawled with graffiti opposing President Viktor Yanukovich . The 2014 Ukrainian revolution of the following month led to more than 100 people perishing .",

      "DSB class D",
      "The Danish State Railways ( DSB ) class D steam locomotive was a 2-6-0 freight steam locomotive developed in co-oporation between the DSB central engineering department and the German locomotive manufacturer Henschel . Class D with 100 units became the backbone of the DSB freight locomotives from the start of its delivery in 1902 until the start of the 1950s when the significance of the railway traffic started to decline . Together with the previous deliveries of the heavier 2-8-0 class H freight locomotive and then in 1952 purchased 10 Belgian-built German class 50\u00dcK locomotives ( DSB class N ) , pushed the class D to the sidelines . When the light GM diesel locomotive class MX was delivered in the start of the 1960s , it was the swansong for class D . Only two class D engines were serviceable when DSB abandoned steam in 1970 ; D 825 and D 826 .",
      "History .",
      "The need for stronger freight train locomotives in the start of the 20th century made DSB order five 2-8-0 tender locomotives by Henschel in the very start of the century . The so far strongest DSB freight locomotive was the 0-6-0 G class tender locomotive which started to be delivered in the 1880s and actually the final units were delivered when the first D class engine was ordered in 1901 .",
      "Class D was a 2-6-0 , two-cylinder , saturated steam tender locomotive with cylinder bore , driving wheel diameter and 47 tons serviceable weight . The engine yielded approx .",
      "DSB acquired in total 100 D class engines between 1902 and 1922 to be numbered D 801 \u2013 900 . They were delivered from such different manufacturers as ; Henschel , S\u00e4chsische Maschinenfabrik and Berliner Maschinenbau ( Germany ) , Tubize ( Belgium ) , Nydquist ( Sweden ) , Baldwin ( USA ) and Frichs ( Denmark ) . The delivery from Baldwin was quite a special story . The State of Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to The US in 1917 and part of the money was used to buy 16 class D engines from Baldwin . The first version called class D I ( one ) , was quite an old fashioned construction without a superheater . It including the engines D 801 \u2013 841 . The next series of engines delivered from 1910\u20131922 , were delivered in two versions : One version numbered 842 \u2013 851 and 865 \u2013 900 , was provided with a superheater ( the very first DSB superheated locomotives ) to be called D II ( two ) . Another version numbered 852 \u2013 864 to be called D III ( three ) , had a larger boiler but no superheater . The engines with superheater made good experience as well as the series with the larger boiler , so DSB decided between 1925 and 1950 to modernize all D I and some D II engines into a modernized version with superheater , larger boiler and larger cab which version was called D IV ( four ) .",
      "Class D was a dedicated freight locomotive and became the backbone of DSB freight traffic on main and branch lines for half a century , though the class was also seen on passenger trains after World War 2 because of the serious lack of traction power . Its popularity earned the class , as one of the few in Denmark , a nickname ; Dagmar which is a traditionally Danish ladies name . When the heavy ex . DR 50 class N arrived in 1952 and later the large deliveries of MY and MX diesels started in the end of the 1950s it was the swansong for class D . The first non modernized locomotives of class D III started to be withdrawn already in the 1950s followed by a massive withdrawal of the class in the first half of the 1960s . Few class D engines could still be found in service on the minor DSB branch lines until around 1967 .",
      "Preservation .",
      "Five class D locomotives have survived . D 802 ( Henschel 5982 of 1902 ) and D 871 ( Baldwin 52434 of 1919 ) are owned by The DSB Railway Museum . D 825 ( S\u00e4chsische Maschinenfabrik 2944 of 1905 ) and D 826 ( S\u00e4chsische Maschinenfabrik 294 5of 1905 ) are owned by The Danish Railway Club ( DJK ) , and D 857 ( BMAG 4374 of 1909 ) is owned by Kolding Locomotive Club ( KLK ) .",

      "John James Conyers Jr . ( May 16 , 1929October 27 , 2019 ) was an American politician of the Democratic Party who served as a U.S . Representative for Michigan from 1965 to 2017 . The districts he represented always included part of western Detroit . During his final three terms , his district included many of Detroits western suburbs , as well as a large portion of the Downriver area .",
      "Conyers served more than fifty years in Congress , becoming the sixth-longest serving member of Congress in U.S . history ; he was the longest-serving African American member of Congress . Conyers was the Dean of the House of Representatives . By the end of his last term , he was the last remaining member of Congress who had served since the presidency of Lyndon B . Johnson .",
      "After serving in the Korean War , Conyers became active in the civil rights movement . He also served as an aide to Congressman John Dingell before winning election to the House in 1964 . He co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969 and established a reputation as one of the most liberal members of Congress . Conyers joined the Congressional Progressive Caucus after it was founded in 1991 . Conyers supported creation of a single-payer healthcare system and sponsored the United States National Health Care Act . He also sponsored a bill to establish Martin Luther King Jr . Day as a federal holiday . Conyers ran for Mayor of Detroit in 1989 and 1993 , but he was defeated in the primary each time .",
      "Conyers served as the ranking Democratic member on the House Committee on the Judiciary from 1995 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2017 . He served as chairman of that committee from 2007 to 2011 and as Chairman of the House Oversight Committee from 1989 to 1995 . In the wake of allegations that he had sexually harassed female staff members and secretly used taxpayer money to settle a harassment claim , Conyers announced his resignation from Congress on December 5 , 2017 .",
      "Early life , education , and early career .",
      "Conyers was born and raised in Detroit , the son of Lucille Janice ( Simpson ) and John James Conyers , a labor leader . Among his siblings was younger brother William Conyers . After graduating from Northwestern High School , Conyers served in the Michigan National Guard from 1948 to 1950 ; the U.S . Army from 1950 to 1954 ; and the U.S . Army Reserves from 1954 to 1957 . Conyers served for a year in Korea during the Korean War as an officer in the U.S . Army Corps of Engineers and was awarded combat and merit citations .",
      "After his active military service , Conyers pursued a college education . He earned both his BA ( 1957 ) and LL.B . ( 1958 ) degrees from Wayne State University . After he was admitted to the bar , he worked on the staff of Congressman John Dingell . He also served as counsel to several Detroit-area labor union locals . From 1961 to 1963 , he was a referee for Michigans workmens compensation department .",
      "Conyers became one of the leaders of the civil rights movement . He was present in Selma , Alabama , on October 7 , 1963 , for the voter registration drive known as Freedom Day .",
      "U.S . House of Representatives .",
      "Elections .",
      "In 1964 , Conyers ran for an open seat in what was then the 1st District , and defeated Republican Robert Blackwell with 84% of the vote . He was reelected 13 times with even larger margins . After the 1990 United States Census , Michigan lost a congressional district , and there was redistricting . Conyerss district was renumbered as the 14th district .",
      "In 1992 , Conyers won re-election to his 15th term in his new district , which included western suburbs of Detroit , with 82% of the vote against Republican nominee John Gordon . He won re-election another nine times after that . His worst re-election performance was in 2010 , when he got 77% of the vote against Republican nominee Don Ukrainec . In 2013 , his district was renamed as the 13th district .",
      "In total , Conyers won re-election twenty-five times and was serving in his twenty-sixth term . He was the dean of the House as longest-serving current member , the third longest-serving member of the House in history , and the sixth longest-serving member of Congress in history . He was the second-longest serving member of either house of Congress in Michigans history , trailing only his former boss , Dingell . He was also the last member of the large Democratic freshman class of 1964 who was still serving in the House .",
      "In May 2014 , Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett determined that Conyers had not submitted enough valid nominating petition signatures to appear on the August 2014 Primary Election ballot . Two of his workers circulating petitions were not themselves registered voters at the time , which was required under Michigan law . But on May 23 , Federal District Judge Matthew Leitman issued an injunction placing Conyers back on the ballot , ruling that the requirement that circulators be registered voters was similar to an Ohio law which had been found unconstitutional in 2008 by a Federal appeals court . The Michigan Secretary of States office subsequently announced they would not appeal the ruling .",
      "Tenure .",
      "Conyers was one of the 13 founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus ( CBC ) and was considered the Dean of that group . Formed in 1969 , the CBC was founded to strengthen African-American lawmakers ability to address the legislative concerns of Black and minority citizens . He served longer in Congress than any other African American . In 1971 , he was one of the original members of Nixons Enemies List .",
      "In 1965 , Conyers won a seat as a freshman on the influential Judiciary Committee , which was then chaired by Democratic Congressman Emanuel Celler of New York . The assignment was considered an elite one , as Judiciary ranked behind only Ways and Means and Appropriations in terms of the number of Members who sought assignment there .",
      "According to the National Journal , Conyers has been considered , with Pete Stark , John Lewis , Jim McDermott , and Barbara Lee , to be one of the most liberal members of Congress for many years . Rosa Parks , known for her prominent role in the Montgomery , Alabama bus boycott , moved to Detroit and served on Conyerss staff between 1965 and 1988 .",
      "Conyers was known to have opposed regulation of online gambling . He opposed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 . After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr . in 1968 , Conyers introduced the first bill in Congress to make Kings birthday a federal holiday . He continued to propose legislation to establish the federal holiday in every session of Congress from 1968 to 1983 , when Martin Luther King Jr . Day was finally signed into law by President Ronald Reagan .",
      "In 1983 he joined with 7 other Congressional Representatives to sponsor a resolution to impeach Ronald Reagan over his sudden and unexpected invasion of Grenada .",
      "Conyers introduced the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act ( ) in January 1989 . He re-introduced this bill each congressional term . It calls for establishing a commission to research the history of slavery in the United States and its effects on current society , which is to recommend ways to remedy this injustice against African Americans . The current version was introduced and referred to committee on January 3 , 2013 . Conyers first introduced the proposed resolution in 1989 , and has stated his intention to annually propose this act until it is approved and passed . Since 1997 , the bill has been designated H.R . 40 , most recently , , alluding to the promise of forty acres and a mule . If passed , the commission would explore the longstanding effects of slavery on todays society , politics , and economy .",
      "Nixon and Watergate .",
      "Conyers was critical of President Richard Nixon during his tenure . He was listed as number 13 on President Nixons enemies list during the presidents 1969\u201374 presidential tenure . The presidents Chief Counsel described him as coming on fast , and said he was emerging as a black anti-Nixon spokesman . Conyers , who voted to impeach Nixon in July 1974 , wrote at the time ,",
      "National Health Care Act .",
      "Conyers submitted the United States National Health Care Act ( Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act ) ( H.R . 676 ) ; as of 2015 , it had 49 cosponsors . He introduced it with 25 cosponsors , in 2003 , and reintroduced it each session since then . The act calls for the creation of a universal single-payer health care system in the United States , in which the government would provide every resident health care free of charge . To eliminate disparate treatment between richer and poorer Americans , the Act would prohibit private insurers from covering any treatment or procedure already covered by the Act .",
      "Downing Street memo .",
      "On May 5 , 2005 , Conyers and 88 other members of Congress wrote an open letter to the White House inquiring about the Downing Street memo . This was a leaked memorandum that revealed an apparent secret agreement between the U.S . and British governments to invade Iraq in 2002 .

      "Conyers responded to these reports , saying , In our country , we strive to honor this fundamental principle that all are entitled to due process .

RTVE is the largest audiovisual group in Spain broadcasting in the Spanish language . Since January 2010 it is financed exclusively by public subsidies .",

      "RTVE throughout its history has undergone numerous restructurings and reorganisations , and has assumed numerous identities . The history of RTVE begins in 1937 with the first broadcasts by Radio Nacional de Espa\u00f1a ( RNE\u2014Spanish National Radio ) from the city of Salamanca . In these early years , RNE served as a propaganda tool for the Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War ; it would later be used by Francisco Franco to inform the Spanish public .",
      "The national radio service depended successively on the FET y de las JONSs , on the ( since 1945 ) and on the Ministry of Information and Tourism , since the creation of the latter in 1951 . It was in July 1945 , as competencies over Press and Propaganda were transferred to the Ministry of National Education when radio broadcasting became a standalone directorate general : the Direcci\u00f3n General de Radiodifusi\u00f3n ( Directorate General for Radio Broadcasting ) .",
      "Television was officially introduced in Spain in October 1956 , and in October 1973 the two broadcasting networks , RNE and Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola ( TVE\u2014Spanish Television ) were consolidated into the Servicio P\u00fablico Centralizado RadioTelevisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola ( RTVE Centralised Public Service ) .",

In 1979 , TVE and RNE were joined by Radiocadena Espa\u00f1ola ( RCE ) , an old radio service that , unlike RNE , could broadcast commercials . In 1980 , RTVE was configured , by statute , as a legal public entity with its own jurisdiction . According to RTVEs annual report ( 2003 ) : This law arose from the Spanish Constitution and the political pluralism which the constitution asserts as a fundamental value of the rule of law ; and in this spirit granted RTVE the right to function as a democratic organisation . The former cinema newsreels service NO-DO was merged into RTVE to be dismantled in 1981 . Since then , the NO-DO archives are property of RTVE and its conservation is on their hands and Filmoteca Nacionals . In 1989 , RCE was dismantled and its radio service was merged into RNE .",

Mediterranean Deployment 2-90 became a Red Sea excursion as the IKE/CVW-7 Battle Group was the first on scene to deter Iraqi aggression in Operation Desert Shield . Once relieved IKE/CVW-7 returned home and began a compressed turnaround training cycle for a May 1991 CENTCOM deployment .

      "Klubi Futbollistik Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb ( ) , is an Albanian professional football club based in Kor\u00e7\u00eb , a city in southeastern Albania . The club play in the Kategoria Superiore , which is the top tier of football in the country . The club was founded as Vllaz\u00ebria Kor\u00e7\u00eb in 1909 . In 1925 , it took on its current form following the merger of several local clubs , and the clubs name was changed to Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb , after Albanias national hero Skanderbeg . The clubs home ground has been the Sk\u00ebnderbeu Stadium since it was built in 1957 , and it now has a capacity of 12,343 , of which 5,724 are seated .",
      "Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb have won 8 league titles , with the first coming in 1933 before going on 78-year run without winning the league . The club won its first league title since 1933 in 2011 , and they have won the league 6 more times since . The club had won six consecutive league titles since 2011 , breaking the Albanian record which had been held by Dinamo Tirana who had won four consecutive titles in the 1950s .",
      "In 2015 the club became the first Albanian side to reach the play-off round of the UEFA Champions League but they lost to Dinamo Zagreb and dropped into the UEFA Europa League , and became the first Albanian side to qualify for the group stages of a UEFA competition .",
      "History .",
      "The first years .",
      "The first football club in the city of Kor\u00e7\u00eb was formed on 15 April 1909 under the name Vllaz\u00ebria by politician and poet Hil\u00eb Mosi . The rise in the popularity of the sport resulted in a number of clubs being formed between 1920 and 1922 , including clubs such as P\u00ebrparimi and Sport Klub Kor\u00e7a . In 1923 , the Albanian National Lyceum formed the Shpresa sports society . Sk\u00ebnderbeu was formed in 1925 when a large number of the young men and young men of the city were playing football regularly in local fields . The rise in popularity of the sport led to most neighbourhoods forming their own football teams , such as Zhgaba in 1926 and Leka i Madh , Pirro , Brekverdhit , Zjarri , Tigri and Diamanti in 1927 , which competed in the citys first organised football competition held in 1928 . These teams were local , however , and would only compete with one another , as the main football club to represent the city was Sk\u00ebnderbeu who overcome several problems at the start , some of which were even political . Sk\u00ebnderbeu was named after 15th century Albanian nobleman and national hero Skanderbeg .",
      "The club quickly became the Albans main football team , and in 1926 they began to play friendly games against teams from neighbouring countries , starting with Macedonian side Monastir , then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . In two games played , Sk\u00ebnderbeu won 5\u20132 and then drew 2\u20132 . Sk\u00ebnderbeu also played friendlies against Greek teams from Ermioni and Thessaloniki , which is modern day Aris FC . They also played against Kavala , who they beat 2\u20130 in Albania but lost 1\u20130 against in Greece .",
      "1930s championships .",
      "The club competed in the first ever national football competition in Albania , which was the 1930 championship . As the only club to represent Kor\u00e7\u00eb nationally , Sk\u00ebnderbeu had huge popular support within the city , with similar support bases seen with the likes of KF Tirana and Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr , who all earned a name for themselves in the early stages of Albanian football . During the 1930 championship , Sk\u00ebnderbeu finished runners-up to KF Tirana , after forfeiting both championship playoff matches . The club won its first ever Albanian Championship just three years later in 1933 , finishing two points ahead of Vllaznia . The championship winning side was : Klani Marjani , Kristaq Bimbli , Andrea \u00c7ani , Andon Miti , Lefter Petra , Fori Stasa , Nexhat Dishnica , Tomor Ypi , Thoma Vangjeli , Servet Teufik Agaj , Enver Kulla , Vasil Trebicka , Stavri Kondili , Aristotel Samsuri , with Qemal Omari as their manager .",
      "In the same year , the clubs striker Servet Teufik Agaj was the top goalscorer with seven league goals , an honour also won by his strike partner Aristotel Samsuri in 1931 , also with seven goals . The following year , Sk\u00ebnderbeu strongly fought to retain their title , but only finished as runners-up once again to KF Tirana , with Samsuri being the clubs top goalscorer that season with seven goals . In the next two championships held prior to World War II , Sk\u00ebnderbeu finished in fourth place in both years under manager Qemal Omari . The club ceased operations between 1938 and 1945 due to World War II , as there were no official tournaments held in Albania .",
      "Post-war struggles .",
      "In 1945 , the club began operating again . Supporters paraded in the streets of Kor\u00e7\u00eb as the club announced the news . The majority of the players who were active in the 1930s were no longer playing football competitively , so the squad was virtually new , except for Klani Marjani , Bellovoda and Saro .",
      "But the delight was short lived as the club struggled to match their performances before the war . In 1945 , they finished fourth in Group B , consisting of six teams , and in the following 1946 season they finished fifth in Group A , just one point ahead of bottom place . Manager Tato Bimbli decided to bring in young players in order to revive the squad during the 1947 season , when the club also changed its name to Dinamo Kor\u00e7\u00eb for the Communist Party , Bimblis decision to bring in young players paid off as the club finished third in the league out of nine teams . The following season , however , turned out to be a disaster as they finished bottom of Group A with just a single point from seven games .",
      "In 1949 , the club changed its name to Kor\u00e7a , and they finished in sixth place out of nine teams in the same year . Manager Tato Bimbli left the club after having a difficult time in charge , and he was replaced by Spiro Ko\u00e7e in 1950 . In 1951 , all Albanian teams were ordered by the Communist Party to be named Puna , which literally translates to work . During these years , the club remained a notable force , but with no relative success often finishing in mid-table in the league . Sk\u00ebnderbeu was also a three time finalist in the Albanian Cup in 1958 , 1965 and 1976 , in which they lost all three finals . They did , however , win the Albanian First Division in 1976\u201377 as well as three other times with the last win in 2008\u201309 season where Sk\u00ebnderbeu won the rights to move into the Albanian Superliga .",
      "Recent dominance .",
      "2009\u201310 .",
      "During the winter of 2009\u201310 , the club was bottom of the league and facing the real possibility of relegation from the Albanian Superliga , but there were seismic changes in terms of the ownership and the board , as a new president in the shape of Red Bull Albania CEO Agim Zeqo was appointed . A new 16-member board was also elected , and a host of new donors attached themselves to the club , including some of Albanias most successful businessmen , such as Samir Mane , Irfan Hysenbelliu and Grigor Joti . Journalist Blendi Fevziu was also named as a donor , alongside national Minister of Finance Ridvan Bode and the prefect of Kor\u00e7\u00eb , Niko Peleshi . The clubs short-term goal was to remain in the Albanian Superliga , and they planned to win the league the following season . In order to escape relegation , the club brought in Mirel Josa as new head coach , along with a host of new players , both from Albania and neighbouring countries . They finished the league in 10th place out of 12 teams , meaning they entered a relegation playoff with the third placed Albanian First Division side KS Kamza , which they won 1\u20130 through a second minute Klodian Asllani goal to remain in the Albanian Superliga .",
      "2010\u201311 .",
      "Ahead of the 2010\u201311 season , the squad was revamped and under the guidance of Shk\u00eblqim Mu\u00e7a as the head coach , new players were brought in , many of whom were Albanian internationals including Orges Shehi , Ditmar Bicaj , Endrit Vrapi , Jetmir Sefa and Bledi Shk\u00ebmbi who was named captain following his return to his hometown club . Other quality signings made Sk\u00ebnderbeu the favourites to win the title . They were defeated by KF Tirana in their first ever Albanian Supercup game , and they spent much of the season in second place in the league , behind pacesetters Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb . Shk\u00eblqim Mu\u00e7a was replaced by Shp\u00ebtim Duro as head coach in February and defeated Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb in his first game in charge to move closer to top spot , and he went on to guide the club to 11 wins in his 13 games in charge , to win the Albanian title for the first time since 1933 and to qualify for the UEFA Champions League qualifying round for the first time in their history . After winning the league for the first time in 78 years , club president Agim Zeqo said , It was a great season and it was great to see our city and our fans enjoy this title .

They continued a poor start to the season as they lost out to KF Tirana in the Albanian Supercup before the start of the Albanian Superliga season , where they also struggled . After only one win in their opening four games , head coach Shp\u00ebtim Duro was replaced by the Czech Stanislav Lev\u00fd , who became the clubs first foreign coach since Qemal Omari in the 1930s , who himself was of Albanian ancestry , making Lev\u00fd the clubs first truly foreign coach . He guided the club to a 14 match unbeaten run to reach the top of the table , and he only lost two games in charge as they narrowly beat Teuta Durr\u00ebs to the title with only a single point between the sides to claim the only Champions League spot once again . In the Albanian Cup , Sk\u00ebnderbeu reached their first final since 1976 , but they lost to KF Tirana as they continued their 100% losing record in Albanian Cup finals , having lost in 1958 , 1965 and 1976 before the 2012 final .",

In the Albanian Cup they were knocked out by Bylis Ballsh in the semi final after a 2\u20131 aggregate loss over two legs , a result which came as a surprise as Sk\u00ebnderbeu had defeated all five teams they had faced during their cup run and were considered the favourites .",

The game against Partizani Tirana was seen by attended by 5500 and there were no altercations between rival fans or any offensive chanting but the Albanian Football Association deemed the choreography of the Ujq\u00ebrit e D\u00ebbor\u00ebs to be worthy of a one match ban on supporters .",

      "Valladolid ( , ) is a city in Spain and the primary seat of government of the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n . It has a population of 309,714 people ( 2013 est. ) , making it Spains 13th most populous municipality and northwestern Spains biggest city . Its metropolitan area ranks 20th in Spain with a population of 414,244 people in 23 municipalities .",
      "The city is situated at the confluence of the Pisuerga and Esgueva rivers before they join the Duero , and located within five winegrowing regions : Ribera del Duero , Rueda , Toro , Tierra de Le\u00f3n , and Cigales .",
      "Valladolid was originally settled in pre-Roman times by the Celtic Vaccaei people , and later the Romans themselves . It remained a small settlement until being re-established by King Alfonso VI of Castile as a Lordship for the Count Pedro Ans\u00farez in 1072 . It grew to prominence in the Middle Ages as the seat of the Court of Castile and being endowed with fairs and different institutions as a collegiate church , University ( 1241 ) , Royal Court and Chancery and the Royal Mint . The city was briefly the capital of Habsburg Spain under Phillip III between 1601 and 1606 , before returning indefinitely to Madrid . The city then declined until the arrival of the railway in the 19th century , and with its industrialisation into the 20th century .",
      "The old town is made up of a variety of historic houses , palaces , churches , plazas , avenues and parks , and includes the National Museum of Sculpture as well as the houses of Zorrilla and Cervantes which are open as museums . Among the events that are held each year in the city are the famous Holy Week , Valladolid International Film Festival ( Seminci ) , and the Festival of Theatre and Street Arts ( TAC ) .",
      "Etymology .",
      "There is no direct evidence for the origin of the modern name of Valladolid .",
      "It is mentioned as Valledolit in the Primera Cr\u00f3nica General ; earlier documented variants include Valledolidi , Valleolide ( 1092 ) and Valleolit , Valleoleti , Valleoliti ( 1095 ) .",
      "One widely held etymological theory suggests that the modern name Valladolid derives from the Celtiberian language expression , meaning valley of waters , referring to the confluence of rivers in the area . Another theory suggests that the name derives from the Arabic expression ( , ) , which means city of al-Walid , referring to Al-Walid I . Yet a third claims that it derives from , meaning valley of the olives ; however , no olive trees are found in that terrain . Instead , in the south part of the city exist an innumerable amount of pine trees . The gastronomy reflects the importance of the ( pine nut ) as a local product , not olives . In texts from the middle ages the town is called Vallisoletum , meaning sunny valley , and a person from the town is a ( male ) , or ( female ) .",
      "The city is also popularly called , a nickname whose origin is not clear , but may refer to knights in the service of Joan of Arc , known as . Another theory is that comes from the fact that Pozzolana cement was sold there , the only city in Spain that sold it .",
      "Geography .",
      "Location .",
      "Valladolid is located at roughly 735 metres above sea level , at the centre of the Meseta Norte , the plateau drained by the Douro river basin covering a major part of the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula . The primitive urban core was built ex novo in the 11th century on a small elevation near the confluence of the Esgueva with the Pisuerga , on the left-bank of the later river . The city of Valladolid currently lies on both banks of the Pisuerga , a major right-bank tributary of the Douro .",
      "Climate .",
      "The city of Valladolid experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate ( Csa ) with influences of a cold semi-arid climate ( BSk ) . Valladolids climate features cool and windy winters due to altitude and an inland location . Fog is very typical in the morning during winter . Winters experience snow and low temperatures below freezing during cold fronts . Valladolids climate is influenced by the distance from the sea and its higher altitude .",
      "Valladolid is drier than Spains northern coastal regions , although there is year-round precipitation . Average annual precipitation is and the average annual relative humidity is 64% . In winter , temperatures very often ( almost every second day ) drop below freezing , often reaching temperatures as low as , and snowfall is common , while the summer months see average high temperatures of . The lowest recorded temperature in Valladolid was and the hottest on 19 July 1995 .",
      "History .",
      "Precedents .",
      "The Vaccaei were a Celtic tribe , the first people with stable presence on the sector of the middle valley of the River Duero documented in historical times .",
      "Remains of Celtiberian and of a Roman camp have been excavated near the city . The nucleus of the city was originally located in the area of the current San Miguel y el Rosarillo square and was surrounded by a palisade . Archaeological proofs of the existence of three ancient lines of walls have been found .",
      "During the time of Muslim rule in Spain , the Christian kings moved the population of this region north into more easily defended areas and deliberately created a no mans land as a buffer zone against further Moorish conquests . The area was captured from the Moors in the 10th century .",
      "Repopulation and growth .",
      "In 1072 Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile gifted the Lordship of Valladolid to Count Pedro Ans\u00farez . Entrusted with the repopulation of the area , Ans\u00farez led the foundation of the city along his wife . By 1084 the project for the foundation of the city was already underway . Ans\u00farez built a palace ( now lost ) and La Antigua church . Eylo founded three hospitals and the Churches of San Sebasti\u00e1n and San Nicol\u00e1s . Both co-founded the church of Santa Mar\u00eda . Valladolid was repopulated by people from the lands of Carri\u00f3n and Salda\u00f1a .",
      "In the 12th and 13th centuries , Valladolid grew rapidly , favoured by the commercial privileges granted by the kings Alfonso VIII and Alfonso X .",
      "Early Modern period .",
      "In 1469 , Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand of Aragon were married in the city ; by the 15th century Valladolid was the residence of the kings of Castile . In 1506 , Christopher Columbus died in Valladolid still convinced that he had reached the Indies in a house that is now a museum dedicated to him .",
      "From 1554 to 1559 , Joanna of Austria , sister of Philip II , served as regent , establishing herself in Valladolid , with the latter becoming the political center of the Hispanic Monarchy by that time .

It has also been keen to critically examine each new school or movement as it has arisen , whether it be German , Polish , Chinese , Canadian or otherwise . With a genuine concern for the art of cinema , for film-making and film-makers rather than the more obvious commercial or glamorous aspects of the industry , the festival has built up an identity of its own \u2013 equally attractive to enthusiasts , professionals and the media .",

      "U-66 was the seventh most successful U-boat in World War II .",
      "On 6 May 1944 , during her ninth patrol , she was sunk west of the Cape Verde Islands by depth charges , ramming and gunfire from Grumman TBF Avenger and Grumman F4F Wildcat aircraft of the US escort carrier and by the destroyer escort .",
      "Patrols .",
      "First .",
      "On 13 May 1940 , three days after the start of the invasion of France , U-66 departed her homeport of Kiel under the command of Richard Zapp , a future Knights Cross recipient , on her first patrol . After about 10 days she rounded the northern coast of Britain and made her way into the mid-Atlantic ocean . After another 20 days , U-66 headed for her new base at Lorient , on the French Atlantic coast ( one of the first to do so ) and where the U-boat was based for the rest of her career .",
      "Second .",
      "After refitting and refueling , U-66 set off to the Cape Verde islands . Following an uneventful six-day voyage , she came upon convoy SL-78 , a convoy designated to give supplies to Allied African countries . The convoy had been attacked just recently by and , one of which ( U-123 ) was in her flotilla . U-66 sank George J . Goulandris and Kalypso Vergotti , two Greek merchantmen of 4,345 and , respectively , west of the Canary Islands . She extended her tonnage sunk with the torpedoing of Saint Anselm on the next day , which was a British steam merchant ship of 5,614 tons . More than two weeks later , she sank Holmside , a 3,433-ton straggler from the convoy OG-67 northeast of the Cape Verde Islands . The remainder of the patrol was unsuccessful ; she returned to Lorient in about a month .",
      "Third .",
      "On 28 August , U-66 left Lorient for north-eastern South America . The patrol was mostly uneventful , but the boat found the Panamanian steam tanker I.C . White ( ) , off the eastern coast of Brazil on 24 September . After a two-day chase , U-66 hit the tanker with one torpedo . U-66 continued the remainder of the patrol without any further incident and returned to Lorient on 9 November .",
      "Fourth .",
      "U-66s fourth sortie was part of Operation Drumbeat , a German attempt to hinder American convoys off the east coast of the United States . U-66 , leaving on 25 December 1941 and in compliance with orders , positioned herself off Cape Hatteras on 15 January 1942 and started to hunt for a target . She found the 6,635-ton American steam tanker Allan Jackson three days later and sank her with two torpedoes north-east of Diamond Shoals , North Carolina . The next day she sank a Canadian passenger liner , , with two stern-launched torpedoes , killing 246 passengers and crew . Another five died in a lifeboat before 71 survivors were rescued five days later by . Three days later with two stern-launched torpedoes she hit Olympic , a Panamanian steam tanker which broke in two after one minute . Two days after that , Empire Gem and Venore ( an British motor tanker and an American steam merchant ship , the latter following the former ) , were both sunk by U-66 . Empire Gem was hit amidships and aft by two torpedoes , while Venore , 20 miles behind , had only one torpedo hit that set her boilers on fire . U-66 then continued eastward back to Lorient , where she arrived on 10 February .",
      "Fifth .",
      "On 21 March , U-66 left for what proved to be her most successful patrol , resulting in 43,956 gross metric tons sunk and 12,502 gross metric tons damaged in the Caribbean Sea . 24 days after departure she sank Korthion , a Greek steam merchantman just south of Barbados with one torpedo hit amidships . Two days later , the boat sank Amsterdam , a Dutch steam tanker , which split in two after being hit by two torpedoes , one amidships , and one in the engine room . Most of the survivors were picked up near Port of Spain , ( Trinidad ) by Ivan , a Yugoslavian steam merchant vessel . The next day U-66 attacked Heinrich von Riedemann , an 11,020-ton Panamanian motor tanker . The first torpedo severely damaged the steering control of her port engine and ruptured a tank of oil , making much of it leak out . 20 minutes after the first hit , just after the starboard engine was stopped , the ship was abandoned when the crew took to the lifeboats . An hour later U-66 hit her with a second torpedo , setting her afire . It extinguished itself within 25 minutes . 50 minutes later the submarine hit her with a third torpedo , which set the ship afire again . She remained that way for about 70 minutes before she finally sank . Nine days later U-66 sank the US Alcoa Partner with a torpedo and a shot from her deck gun .",
      "Sixth .",
      "After her fifth patrol , Richard Zapp left U-66 to take command of the 3rd U-boat Flotilla . This meant that Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Friedrich Markworth was in charge . The submarine started her sixth patrol with the sinking of Triglav , a Yugoslavian steamer , after depositing a sick crew-member in Spain . After a couple of weeks , U-66 ran across the 4,942-ton Brazilian merchant ship Tamandar\u00e9 , sinking her with a torpedo hit in her stern . The survivors were picked up by the . Two days after the attack on Tamandar\u00e9 , U-66 sank Weirbank , a British merchantman on 28 July 1942 , with the second of two torpedoes launched at her . Four days after her previous sinking , two mines from U-66 severely damaged two British motor torpedo boats that had left on a patrol from Port Castries , St . Lucia . Those two mines had been laid , along with four others , on 20 July . U-66 subsequently sank the 766 ton Polish Rozewie on 6 August and the American Topa Topa on the 29th . The next day she sank both the Panamanian Sir Huon and the American West Lashaway in separate attacks . A raft with survivors from West Lashaway was sighted by three aircraft on 18 September ; , one of the escorts of a small convoy went to investigate . Deciding that the raft could be a disguised U-boat , Vimy opened fire , luckily with no result . The rafts sail was hastily cut down , upon which the British destroyer rescued 17 people .",
      "U-66 also sank the Winamac on 31 August and the Swedish Peiping on 9 September . She returned to Lorient on 29 September .",
      "Seventh ( aborted ) .",
      "On 9 November 1942 , U-66 left Lorient on what should have been her 7th war patrol . Soon after departure , leaks were encountered , and she decided to return . On 10 November , the day before she returned , a British Wellington bomber , equipped with a Leigh Light , spotted her and dropped four depth charges . The U-boat escaped without serious damage .",
      "Seventh .",
      "U-66 left Lorient on 6 January 1943 for what was officially her seventh patrol . On 20 January , the ship landed an espionage agent on the coast of Mauritania , but the agent and two crewmen were immediately captured . Her first sinking came with the attack on the 113-ton French Joseph Elise on 1 February . On the 27th , U-66 attacked the 4,312-ton British coal merchant ship St . Margaret in mid-Atlantic near Bermuda , sinking her with one torpedo and , after several misses , a shell . Several survivors were captured and taken to the prison camp Marlag und Milag Nord . U-66 then returned to port , arriving on 24 March 1943 .",
      "Eighth .",
      "U-66s eighth patrol started after a quick refit on 7 April 1943 when she left Lorient . At 148 days , it was to be her longest . She first sank the 10,173-ton American Esso Gettysburg , which was carrying crude oil , on 10 June after unsuccessfully attempting to attack several other American tankers . On 2 July , she successfully sank the 10,195-ton Bloody Marsh ( this ship was on her maiden voyage ) , with a torpedo . The last ship encountered on the patrol was the 10,172-ton Cherry Valley , also American , which she sank on 22 July . U-66 then returned to Lorient .",
      "Ninth .",
      "On 16 January 1944 , U-66 left Lorient for what would be her last patrol and the last command of Oberleutnant zur See Gerhard Seehausen ( posthumously promoted to Kapit\u00e4nleutnant ) . A month and ten days after departure , U-66 sighted Silvermaple , a 5,313-ton British motor merchant in the convoy ST-12 . She was sunk after one torpedo hit . Four days later , the boat came upon the French 5,202-ton St . Louis , which she sank with two torpedoes off Accra , Ghana . The ship broke into three parts , which sank in less than 50 seconds . Four days after the sinking of St . Louis , on 5 March 1944 U-66 sank the 4,964-ton British John Holt with two torpedoes , and took the captain , Master Cecil Gordon Hime , and a passenger , Mr Elliott - an agent of the Holt Shipping Company , prisoner . These men were later lost with the U-boat . Nearly three weeks after the sinking of John Holt , the U-boat came across the 4,257-ton British Matadian , which she torpedoed and sank . After the attack , U-66 was forced to bottom out in the mud as British patrol craft engaged her . U-66 was supposed to be resupplied by , but this boat , a Milchkuh supply submarine , was sunk on 26 April .",
      "Sinking .",
      "On 1 May 1944 , U-66 came under attack by American ships from an antisubmarine hunter-killer group formed around . Three Fido homing torpedoes were dropped near the boat , and numerous aircraft from Block Island , along with smaller craft , were designated to hunt for her . On the morning of 6 May , the destroyer escort found the submarine . After an exchange of gunfire and torpedoes , Buckley , under the command of Lieutenant Commander Brent Abel , rammed the submarine .",
      "With the two vessels stuck fast , a party of Germans , under the command of U-66s first officer , Klaus Herbig , attempted to climb onto the American escorts forecastle to create a diversion while Seehausen and the remainder of the U-boats crew worked to free the boat . As American sailors saw the boarding party climbing on deck , hand-to-hand fighting broke out in which a number of Germans were killed or wounded before the U-boat was able to make good its escape . Five armed Germans remained on deck of the destroyer but they were quickly over-powered and taken prisoner . Buckleys 3-inch gun was unleashed on the U-boat as the Americans chased after her , but U-66 then turned and rammed Buckley near her engine room , damaging the ships starboard screw . Soon afterward , U-66 was scuttled on Seehausens orders to prevent her secret equipment from being captured . Buckley then began rescue operations , which lasted three hours .",
      "U-66 was lost at position with 24 dead and 36 survivors , all of whom were captured by Buckley . Seehausen was not among the survivors , who were later transferred to Block Island . For his act of ramming U-66 , Brent Abel received the Navy Cross .",

In April 2004 , Higgins entered the race , and narrowly defeated then-Erie County Comptroller Nancy Naples .

We oppose any cuts to Social Security benefits , including raising the retirement age . We also oppose any effort to privatize Social Security , in whole or in part .. . cutting Social Security benefits beyond the already scheduled increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67 would create even more needless hardship for millions of vulnerable Americans . This was in response to Obama giving the task of cutting government spending to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform on October 15 , 2010 . The letter also stressed that Social Security is prohibited by law from adding to the national budget deficit .",

      "Rio Haryanto",
      "Rio Haryanto ( born 22 January 1993 ) is an Indonesian racing driver who currently competes in Blancpain GT World Challenge Asia for T2 Motorsports . He raced for Manor in Formula One for the first 12 races of the 2016 Formula One season . As of 2021 , he is the first and only Indonesian driver to compete in Formula One .",
      "Career .",
      "Asian series .",
      "Haryanto was born in Solo . He began his car racing career competing in three Asian-based series during 2008 : the Asian Formula Renault Challenge , Formula Asia 2.0 , and Formula BMW Pacific . He was most competitive in the FAsia 2.0 series , winning two races to finish third overall in the championship behind expatriate European drivers Felix Rosenqvist and Matthias Beche .",
      "In 2009 he again competed in a variety of series , including the Australian Drivers Championship and the Asian Formula Renault Challenge once more . His main focus this year , however , was the Formula BMW Pacific championship , which he dominated with 11 victories from the 15 races ( although five of these races were won outright by invitational drivers who were not entered in the championship ) , driving for the Malaysian Meritus team . This included a perfect run of four outright victories , pole positions and fastest laps in the four consecutive races held at his home circuit of Sentul . He also competed in a round of the equivalent European FBMW series , himself a guest driver on this occasion .",
      "GP3 Series .",
      "Haryanto stepped up to the more competitive European racing scene full-time for 2010 by joining the Manor Racing team for the Formula One-supporting GP3 Series . His three teammates during the season were James Jakes , Adrien Tambay and Adrian Quaife-Hobbs . In an impressive first season at this level , he won a race at Istanbul Park and took two further podium placings to finish fifth place in the drivers championship , the leading Manor driver . His form was one of the surprises of the season , according to the Autosport magazine . He remained with the team for 2011 , now badged as Marussia Manor Racing , alongside Quaife-Hobbs and Matias Laine . Despite increasing his victory count to two , with wins at the N\u00fcrburgring and the Hungaroring , his inconsistency\u2014including a run of seven races without scoring points at the start of the year\u2014saw him slip to seventh place in the championship , behind Quaife-Hobbs . Both of his victories were in rainy conditions , giving him something of a reputation as a wet-weather specialist .",
      "Auto GP .",
      "In addition to his GP3 duties , Haryanto also drove for the DAMS team in the Auto GP series , competing in all but one round of the championship as it clashed with the GP3 schedule . Driving alongside Sergey Afanasyev and part-timer Tambay , he took a win at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia and finished seventh in the drivers standings . The efforts of Haryanto , Afanasyev , Tambay , and Haryantos substitute , Kevin Korjus , were enough for DAMS to win the teams championship .",
      "GP2 Series .",
      "Haryanto made his GP2 Series d\u00e9but with DAMS at the non-championship season finale at Yas Marina in 2011 . He was in the series full-time for 2012 with the Marussia-backed Carlin team , where he partnered Max Chilton . He was the first Indonesian to compete at this level of motorsport since Ananda Mikola competed in International Formula 3000 during 2000 and 2001 . In his first season of GP2 , Haryanto secured a single fastest lap , a single pole position\u2014in wet conditions at Spa , confirming his reputation as a wet-weather specialist\u2014and a best race finish of fifth in the feature race at Valencia , securing 14th place in the championship at seasons end .",
      "He raced in the 2013 GP2 Series for the Barwa Addax Team alongside teammate Jake Rosenzweig . On 30 June 2013 , he gained his first podium in the GP2 Series at Silverstone and the same time , first podium for the Barwa Addax Team in the 2013 GP2 season .",
      "For the 2014 GP2 Series he moved to EQ8 Caterham Racing , partnering with Alexander Rossi . On 24 May 2014 , he gained his second podium in the GP2 Series at Monaco and , at the same time , first podium in the 2014 GP2 season .",
      "Haryanto switched to Campos for the 2015 GP2 Series season . After taking second place at the feature race in Bahrain , Haryanto took his first win in GP2 in the following days sprint race . He achieved his second victory in the sprint race at the Red Bull Ring despite a damaged front wing . Haryanto finished the 2015 GP2 Series season in fourth place with 138 points .",
      "Formula One .",
      "Haryanto has been linked to the Virgin Racing/Marussia F1/Manor Racing team since his first GP3 season with Manor in 2010 , as he has driven for junior teams with its backing since then . In the autumn of that year , he won the right to test with Virgin at the end of the 2010 season due to his finishing position as the highest ranked Manor driver in the GP3 final standings . He tested for Virgin in Abu Dhabi on 16 November . Suffering gearbox problems , he posted the slowest time of the thirteen runners in the morning session . He did not receive the prize test in 2011 because teammate Adrian Quaife-Hobbs beat him in the standings on this occasion .",
      "Haryanto and 2012 GP2 Series teammate Max Chilton drove for Marussia in the first young driver tests of 2012 , held in-season at Silverstone . Running over the course of two days , Haryanto completed three hundred kilometres of testing , satisfying one of the conditions to be eligible for a superlicence and becoming the first Indonesian driver to qualify for one .",
      "Manor ( 2016 ) .",
      "On 18 February 2016 Haryanto was confirmed as a driver of Manor Racing for the 2016 Formula One season alongside 2015 DTM Champion Pascal Wehrlein . He made his debut at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix , however got off to a rocky start with an incident involving Romain Grosjean when they collided in the pit lane during practice . Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident , as well as two penalty points added to his licence . Haryanto retired from his debut race due to a drive link problem on the 18th lap . Amusingly however , Haryanto was the most-voted driver in F1s newly-introduced Driver of the Day vote , before the award went to Romain Grosjean , who scored points for the debuting Haas team .",
      "Haryanto was the second driver to be eliminated from qualifying for the 2016 Bahrain Grand Prix , ahead of Felipe Nasr . However , this meant a grid place of 20th due to Renaults Kevin Magnussen having to start from the pitlane after failing to stop for weighing during practice . He was the last car to finish the race , in 17th place and one lap down . He managed to beat the other Renault driver Jolyon Palmer to 21st in China , before he became tangled up in a first-lap crash in Russia that involved Nico H\u00fclkenberg and Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez . Haryanto repeated his Bahrain performance in Spain , with his next race in Monaco bringing him a career-best 15th , albeit 4 laps down and once again the last classified finisher . He remained the last classified car in the next two races , with 19th and 18th places , before a 16th-place finish in Austria brought attention to the gap in talent between himself and teammate Wehrlein , who scored Manors only point of the season in the same race . He spun off in the wet in Britain , whilst what would turn out to be his final two races again saw him the last classified finisher as his future became unclear due to a lack of sponsorship .",
      "On 10 August 2016 , Manor confirmed that they were demoting Haryanto to reserve driver due to the lack of sponsorship . This was because the promised funds from Indonesian Sport Ministry had been blocked by the Parliament , citing invalid procedure of funding procurements by the Sport Minister . Esteban Ocon was announced as his replacement . When the parent company of the team collapsed at the end of the season , Haryanto was the only driver of the team not to make the 2017 grid , with Ocon and Wehrlein moving to Force India and Sauber respectively .",
      "Endurance racing .",
      "Haryanto participated in the 2018 SIC888 Race at Shanghai International Circuit . He teamed up with fellow Indonesians , Anderson Tanoto and Audi R8 LMS Cup champion Andrew Haryanto , driving an Audi R8 LMS GT4 . The trio finished the 6-hour race in 5th position .",

      "Bohemond IV of Antioch",
      "Bohemond IV of Antioch , also known as Bohemond the One-Eyed ( ; 1175\u20131233 ) , was Count of Tripoli from 1187 to 1233 , and Prince of Antioch from 1201 to 1216 and from 1219 to 1233 . He was the younger son of Bohemond III of Antioch . The dying Raymond III of Tripoli offered his county to Bohemonds elder brother , Raymond , but their father sent Bohemond to Tripoli in late 1187 . Saladin , the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt and Syria , conquered the county , save for the capital and two fortresses , in summer 1188 .",
      "Raymond died in early 1197 , leaving a posthumous son , Raymond-Roupen . Raymond-Roupens mother , Alice , was the niece of Leo I of Cilicia who persuaded the Antiochene noblemen to acknowledge Raymond-Roupens right to succeed his grandfather . However , the Latin and Greek burghers proclaimed Bohemond heir to his father . After his father died in April 1201 , Bohemond seized Antioch with the support of the burghers , the Knights Templar and Hospitallers , and the Italian merchants .",
      "Bohemond made an alliance with Az-Zahir Ghazi , the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo , and Kaykaus I , the Seljuq sultan of Rum , who often invaded Cilicia during the following years , to prevent Leo I from attacking Antioch . Conflicts between Bohemond and the Latin Patriarchs of Antioch enabled Raymond-Roupen to seize Antioch in 1216 , but Bohemond regained the principality in 1219 . After Leo Is death , Bohemond tried to secure Cilicia to his younger son , Philip , but Constantine of Baberon , who had administered Cilicia during the previous years , imprisoned Philip in 1224 . Bohemond allied with Kayqubad I , sultan of Rum , but he could not prevent Philips murder in 1225 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Bohemond was the younger son of Bohemond III of Antioch by his first wife , Orgueilleuse of Harenc . He was born around 1175 . His mother was last mentioned in a charter issued in 1175 . Bohemonds widowed father married a relative of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos , Theodora , but he repudiated her shortly after Manuels death in 1180 . He married Sybil , an Antiochene noblewoman , described as a prostitute or sorcerer by 12th-century authors . She was a spy of Saladin , the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt and Syria . Aimery of Limoges , Latin Patriarch of Antioch , excommunicated Bohemonds father for his third marriage .",
      "Reign .",
      "Count of Tripoli .",
      "The childless Raymond III of Tripoli decided to bequeath his county to his godson , Raymond , who was Bohemonds elder brother . Bohemond III of Antioch sent Bohemond to Tripoli , because the union of Antioch and Tripoli under one monarch could jeopardize the defence of both crusader states . Raymond III of Tripoli ordered his vassals to do homage to Bohemond . The dying count , who was a member of the House of Toulouse , also prescribed that should another member of his family come from Toulouse , Bohemond should cede the County of Tripoli to him . Raymond died in late 1187 . Charters issued during the first years of Bohemonds rule imply that his elder brother was regarded a titular count of Tripoli for a while .",
      "After Saladin conquered almost the whole Kingdom of Jerusalem in the second half of 1187 , Queen Sibylla sought shelter in Tripoli , which became a center of her supporters . The noblemen who condemned her husband , Guy of Lusignan , for the fall of the kingdom , joined Conrad of Montferrat at Tyros . Saladin decided to invade the crusader states in Syria . He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188 , but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town . After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala ( present-day Tartus and Jableh in Syria ) in July , only Tripoli , Krak des Chevaliers , and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian rule in the county .",
      "Saladin released Guy of Lusignan who joined his wife . Guy , Sybilla , and their supporters left Tripoli and laid siege to Acre in August 1189 . The siege was the first sign of a new Christian offensive . Richard I of England could not reoccupy Jerusalem during the Third Crusade , but he ensured the survival of the Kingdom of Jerusalem before leaving the Holy Land on 9 October 1192 . Taking advantage of the crusade , Bohemonds father made a ten-year truce with Saladin on 30 October 1192 . The truce covered both Antioch and Tripoli .",
      "Bohemonds stepmother , Sybil , wanted to secure the succession of Antioch to her son , William . Leo , Lord of Armenian Cilicia exploited her ambitions . With her assistance , he captured and imprisoned Bohemond III in early 1194 . Leo also forced Bohemond III to surrender Antioch to him , but the Latin and Greek burghers formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from seizing the town . The commune proclaimed Bohemond IIIs elder son , Raymond , regent . Bohemond hurried from Tripoli to Antioch at the head of his army to help his brother , compelling the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia . Leo released their father only after Bohemond III renounced his claim to suzerainty over Cilicia .",
      "Raymond died in early 1197 . His widow , Alice , was Leo of Cilicias niece and heir . Bohemond III sent Alice and her posthumous son , Raymond-Roupen , to Leo , implying that he wanted to disinherit his grandson . Leo of Cilicia persuaded the papal legate , Conrad of Wittelsbach , Archbishop of Mainz , to visit Antioch . On the archbishops demand , Bohemond III declared Raymond-Roupen his heir and ordered the Antiochene noblemen to swear fealty to the boy . Raymond-Roupen was the only son of the first-born son of Bohemond III and thus heir by primogeniture , but Bohemond was Bohemond IIIs closest male relative and so heir by proximity of blood .",
      "In early 1198 , Bohemond marched to Antioch and gained the support of the military orders and the Italian merchants , promising new grants to them . The commune also acknowledged his claim to rule , because the burghers feared that the Armenians influence would increase if Raymond-Roupen succeeded his grandfather . Bohemond returned to Tripoli shortly after his claim was confirmed , because Leo of Cilicia broke into the principality to restore Bohemond III . Bohemond styled himself son of Prince Bohemond of Antioch and by the grace of God count of Tripoli to emphasize his right to inherit Antioch .",
      "War of Succession .",
      "Bohemond hurried to Antioch when his father died in April 1201 . The commune confirmed his right to rule . The military orders also supported him , but the noblemen who remained loyal to Raymond-Roupen fled to Cilicia . Leo of Cilicia besieged Antioch to assert Raymond-Roupens claim . Bohemond made an alliance with Az-Zahir Ghazi , the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo , and Kaykaus I , the Seljuq sultan of Rum , who forced the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia .",
      "Leo tried to gain the support of the Holy See against Bohemond , promising to unite the Armenian Church with Rome . Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch in late spring 1203 . Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate , stating that the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers . Gaetani mediated a reconciliation between Bohemond and the Hospitallers , but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement , because the Holy See could not make a judgement about feudal rights in the principality .",
      "In 1203 , Renoart of Nephin , Bohemonds vassal , married Isabel the heiress of Gibelcar , without his authorization . The High Court of Tripoli ordered the confiscation of Renoarts fiefs . However , he decided to resist and gained the support of Leo and Aimery , the king of Cyprus and Jerusalem . Bohemond traveled to Acre in summer 1204 to meet Marie of Champagne . Her husband , Baldwin I , had been recently crowned emperor in Constantinople . He did homage to her , acknowledging the suzerainty of the Latin emperors over Antioch . Marie tried to mediate a reconciliation between Bohemond and Leo of Cilicia , but she died in August .",
      "Renoart of Nephin pillaged the countryside and led his troops to Tripoli in late 1204 . Bohemond lost an eye in a battle at the gates of the town . He could only crush the rebellion after Aimery died in April 1205 . He captured both Nephin and Gibelcar before the end of the year , forcing Renart to flee to Cyprus . Before long , Bohemond returned to Antioch .",
      "Bohemond had already been on bad terms with the Latin patriarch of Antioch , Peter of Angoul\u00eame . Taking advantage of a conflict between the patriarch and the papal legate , Peter Capuano , Bohemond restored the Eastern Orthodox patriarch of Antioch , Symeon II , in early 1206 or 1207 . Peter of Angoul\u00eame and the papal legate were reconciled and the patriarch excommunicated Bohemond , Symeon and the commune with the approval of the Holy See . He also imposed an interdict on Antioch , but the burghers ignored his decision and visited the Greek churches .",
      "Peter of Angoul\u00eame helped Raymond-Roupens supporters to return from Cilicia to Antioch in late 1207 . Surprised by the coup , Bohemond sought refuge in the citadel . Although Leo of Cilicia also entered the town , Bohemond was able to muster his troops and defeat his enemies . He captured and imprisoned the Latin patriarch who refused to acknowledge him as the lawful prince . After Peter of Angoul\u00eame died of thirst , Pope Innocent III ordered Albert Avogadro , the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem , to excommunicate Bohemond . Bohemond continued to support the Eastern Orthodox patriarch and did not allow Peter of Ivrea , the new Latin patriarch of Antioch , to visit his see . He also debated the right of the Holy See to make a judgement about the succession in Antioch , stating that the principality was a fief of the Latin emperors of Constantinople .",
      "The Hospitallers made raids against Hama , Homs and Latakia from their castles in Bohemonds realms . Al-Adil I , the Ayyubid ruler of Damascus and Egypt , blamed Bohemond for the knights actions . Al-Adil broke into the County of Tripoli , forcing Bohemond to pay a compensation in 1208 or 1209 .",
      "Az-Zahir Ghazi invaded Cilicia to prevent Leo from attacking Antioch in 1209 . Cilician soldiers who tried to seize a caravan wounded the grand master of the Knights Templar Guillaume de Chartres , in a skirmish on the plains near Antioch in 1211 . Their action annoyed Pope Innocent who excommunicated Leo of Cilicia . Bohemond expelled the Eastern Orthodox patriarch from Antioch , allowing Peter of Ivrea to take charge of his see . John of Brienne , King of Jerusalem , sent reinforcements to Antioch to fight against the Armenians . Leo dispatched Raymond-Roupen to attack the Templars domains in Bohemonds principality in 1212 .",
      "A group of Assassins murdered Bohemonds eldest son , Raymond , in 1213 . At the time , the Assassins were tributaries to the Hospitallers and Bohemond suspected the Hospitallers had been involved in the murder . After Bohemond and the Templars laid siege their fortress at Khawabi , the Assassins sought assistance from Bohemonds old ally , Az-Zahir Ghazi . Az-Zahir Ghazi appealed to Al-Adil , although they had been enemies . Their alliance forced Bohemond to lift the siege and to send an apology to Az-Zahir Ghazi .",
      "Bohemond preferred to stay in Tripoli which caused discontent among the citizens of Antioch . Peter of Ivrea , the Hospitallers and Acharie of Sermin , who was the senechal of Antioch and head of the commune , started negotiations with Leo of Cilicia about the surrender of Antioch to Raymond-Roupen . They helped the Cilician troops to enter Antioch on 14 February 1216 . The Templars abandoned the citadel without resistance and Raymond-Roupen was installed as prince .",
      "Duke Leopold VI of Austria , who landed at Acre in late summer 1217 , invited Bohemond to join the Fifth Crusade . Bohemond and his vassals marched to Acre . However , the crusade ended in failure because of the lack of a united command . Bohemond left the Kingdom of Jerusalem together with Andrew II of Hungary and Hugh I of Cyprus in January 1218 . Andrew attended at the wedding of Bohemond and Hughs half-sister Melisende in Tripoli . During the same year , Moslem troops made a plundering raid against the County of Tripoli .",
      "Conflicts .",
      "In 1219 , a group of Antiochene noblemen rose up against Raymond-Roupen who had lost Leo of Cilicias support . Their leader , William Farabel , urged Bohemond to come to Antioch . Raymond-Roupen sought refuge in the citadel , but he was forced to leave Antioch . He entrusted the citadel to the Hospitallers . Bohemond hurried to Antioch and seized the principality . The Hospitallers abandoned the citadel without resistance .",
      "Before long , Bohemond granted Jabala ( which was still to be conquered ) to the Templars although Raymond-Roupen had promised the town to the Hospitallers . The papal legate , Cardinal Pelagius , brokered an agreement between the military orders , dividing the town between them . However , Bohemond remained hostile to the Hospitallers . After he confiscated their property in Antioch , Pelagius excommunicated him .",
      "Constantine of Baberon , the regent for Isabella of Cilicia , offered her hand to Bohemonds son , Philip , because he needed Bohemonds assistance against Kayqubad I , Sultan of Rum . Bohemond accepted the offer and his son married Isabella in June 1222 . Bohemond and Philip repelled a Seldjuq attack against Cilicia . Philips blatant favoritism towards his Frankish retainers enabled Constantine of Baberon to hatch a plot against him . Philip and his supporters were captured and imprisoned at the end of 1224 . Bohemond tried to ensure his sons liberation through negotiations . He appealed to Pope Honorius III , but the pope confirmed his excommunication and forbade the Templars to assist him . Bohemond persuaded Kayqubad I to invade Cilicia . Although Bohemonds son had already been poisoned , Constantine of Baberon promised that Philip would be released if Bohemond come to Cilicia . Shortly after Bohemonds departure , Shihab ad-Din Toghril , atabeg of Aleppo , broke into the Principality of Antioch . After learning of his sons death and Toghrils invasion , Bohemond hurried back .",
      "The Holy Roman Emperor , Frederick II , summoned the Christian rulers of Syria and the Holy Land to Cyprus . Bohemond joined him while Frederick was marching from Limassol to Nicosia in August 1228 . Frederick demanded an oath of fealty for Antioch and Tripoli from Bohemond , but Bohemond feigned a nervous breakdown and returned to Nephin . Bohemond again met Frederick in Acre in 1229 , but Bohemonds realms were not included in the peace treaty between Frederick and Al-Kamil , sultan of Egypt , on 18 February 1229 .",
      "At the Hospitallers request , Pope Gregory IX repeated the excommunication of Bohemond in March 1230 . He authorized Gerald of Lausanne , Patriarch of Jerusalem , to lift the ban if Bohemond agreed to make peace with the Hospitallers . With the mediation of Gerald and the Ibelins , Bohemond and the Hospitallers made a treaty which was signed on 26 October 1231 . Bohemond confirmed the Hospitallers right to hold Jabala and a nearby fortress and granted them money fiefs in both Tripoli and Antioch . The knights renounced the privileges that Raymond-Roupen had granted to them . Before long , Gerald of Lausanne lifted the excommunication and sent the treaty to Rome to be confirmed by the Holy See .",
      "John of Ibelin , who was the leader of Emperor Fredericks opponents in the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus , tried to convince Bohemond to support their cause . John sent his son , Balian , to Tripoli to negotiate with Bohemond , but the elderly Bohemond remained neutral in the conflict . Bohemond died in March 1233 , a few weeks before the popes confirmation of his treaty with the Hospitallers came to Tripoli . He was regarded as a great jurist by his contemporaries .",
      "Family .",
      "Bohemonds first wife , Plaisance , was the daughter of Hugh III Embriaco , Lord of Jabala , and Stephanie of Milly . The marriage secured Bohemonds position in the County of Tripoli . Raymond , the eldest son of Bohemond and Plaisance , was murdered at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa in 1213 at the age of 18 . Bohemond was succeeded by his second son , Bohemond , in both Antioch and Tripoli .

      "Servant of the People ( political party )",
      "Servant of the People ( ) is a centrist political party in Ukraine .",
      "It was formed in late 2017 and was officially registered on 31 March 2018 on the basis of the previously registered party of Decisive Changes . The party is named after the Ukrainian hit TV series Servant of the People . In the 2019 parliamentary election the party won 124 seats on the nationwide party list and 130 constituency seats . The current president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is a member of the party .",
      "History .",
      "Founding .",
      "Legally , the party is the successor of the Party of Decisive Change ( ) that existed since April 2016 and was founded by Eugene Yurdiga .",
      "The party was renamed in December 2017 after the eponymous Ukrainian hit TV series Servant of the People that starred Volodymyr Zelensky and was made by his TV production company Kvartal 95 . The rebranded/renamed partys first leader was the CEO of Kvartal 95 Ivan Bakanov . At the time Kvartal 95 created the party , they claimed it was important to do so to prevent others from stealing the name of the eponymous series for cynical political purposes . According to Zelensky in the summer of 2017 some rogues had almost registered a party called Servant of the People and that because of this Kvartal 95 had registered their Servant of the People party so voters would not be mislead to think they would vote for a party that was not related to the TV series of the same name . Early 2018 Zelensky stated that the party was not yet a political project , and said about its future : Lets see .",
      "In December 2017 4% of Ukrainians polled by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center declared their readiness to vote for a party named Servant of the People in parliamentary elections , and in May 2018 this number had grown to 5% ( the minimum necessary to pass Ukraines election threshold ) . When democracy watchdog Chesno tried to contact Zelensky and party representatives in September 2018 in an attempt to ask if the party would take part in elections a spokeswoman for Kvartal 95 responded Unfortunately , party representatives are unable to comment on your request . There is currently no information that might be of interest to you . The press service of Kvartal 95 could ( also ) not provide Chesno a picture of party leader Bakanov . Chesno was able to find out that the leadership of the party only consisted of people related to Kvartal-95 .",
      "Billboards advertising Servants of the People appeared on the streets of Ukrainian cities in November 2018 . Zelensky later admitted that these billboards were legally only advertising the third season of the TV series Servant of the People but were also part of his election campaign so his campaign could save a lot of money . The partys first financiers were either NGOs that did not have to report the origins of their donations or companies that all changed their addresses in the same week , this led Chesno to believe these companies were interconnected . Almost all of the 2018 funds were received on the eve of Zelenskys 2019 New Years speech in which he announced his candidacy in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election .",
      "Party winning the 2019 presidential and parliamentary election .",
      "In late December 2018 Zelensky was declared a presidential candidate from the party at the 2019 presidential election . While lagging behind in January 2019 , Zelensky began to lead the polls by March . He would go on to win the first round of the presidential elections , taking first place and moving on to the run off against incumbent President Poroshenko on 21 April 2019 , winning the election with over 73% of the votes cast . Zelensky stated that the party would not enter a coalition government with the Petro Poroshenko Bloc , nor with Opposition Platform \u2014 For Life .",
      "In his inauguration speech to parliament on 21 May 2019 President Zelensky dissolved parliament and decreed an early election to be held on 21 July 2019 . On 27 May 2019 Dmytro Razumkov was appointed as party chairman in place of Ivan Bakanov . Oleksandr Kornienko had been made head of the partys election headquarters , and Mykhailo Fedorov was installed as the partys chief of digital strategies.<ref Presidents Party Names New Head , Will Interview Candidates For July Elections , Radio Free Europe ( 27 May 2019 ) </ref> On 2 June 2019 , the registration of potential candidates to run for the party in majority constituencies during the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election ended . Party leader Razumkov assured on 7 June 2019 that no incumbent MPs would be on the party list for the 2019 parliamentary election , but that the election list would consist of new ambitious politicians .",
      "The party held its first congress on 9 June 2019 . It took place in Kyivs Hryshko National Botanical Garden and was attended by President Zelensky and party leader Razumkov , among others . During the congress the first names of the partys majority constituency candidates and the 97 candidates of the nationwide closed party list were made public . Well-known names in the nationwide party list were : Olympic athletes Olha Saladukha , Vadym Gutzeit and Zhan Beleniuk and long-term CEO of 1+1 Media Group Oleksandr Tkachenko . Three days later Gutzeit and two other candidates had withdrawn themselves from the election , whilst a fourth was excluded from the list after additional checks . During the post-primaries , press and activists highlighted the most controversial representatives of the party , such as Oleksandr Dubinsky and Max Buzhanskiy . Both of them were not withdrawn from the final list of the party after the registration deadlines . The party excluded seven candidates from its list on 7 July 2019 ; five candidates were removed \u201cas a result of information submitted [ to the party ] via the website and chat bot\u201d , whilst two others requested to be removed from the list , including the No . 31 candidate . On 19 July 2019 , the leader of the Movement of New Forces party Mikheil Saakashvili called on his supporters to vote for the Servant of the People party at the parliamentary election .",
      "In the ( 21 July ) 2019 parliamentary election the he top ten party candidates were Dmytro Razumkov , Ruslan Stefanchuk , Iryna Venediktova , Davyd Arakhamia , Halyna Yanchenko , Mykhailo Fedorov , Oleksandr Kornienko , Anastasia Krasnosilska , Oleksandr Tkachenko and Zhan Beleniuk . In the election the party won 124 seats on the nationwide party list ( 43.16% of the votes ) and 130 constituency seats . Several members of the political party UKROP ( a party that has openly been supported by Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi ) won constituency seats as candidates for Servant of the People ( the two parties had no formal allegiance ) . In parliament Davyd Arakhamia became the partys faction leader .",
      "Party since winning the 2019 parliamentary election .",
      "On 11 November 2019 Oleksandr Kornienko replaced Razumkov as party chairman .",
      "The party won about 25% of the votes in December 2019 local United territorial community elections ( non-aligned candidates gained 44% of the votes ) .",
      "In June 2020 the party started to create its local organisation by appointing Cell leaders . In May 2020 the party had no official registered local branch .",
      "In the 2020 Ukrainian local elections the party won more seats then the other parties participating , 17.59% of local seats were won by the party . Observers pointed out that the party ( as other national parties ) did suffer setbacks in Ukraines largest cities across the country , including the capital Kyiv . In Kyiv the party mayoral candidate Iryna Vereshchuk and the party itself finished in fifth place . While Servant of the People had been in the 2019 parliamentary election the most popular party among Kyivites with 36.46% . 225 Servant of the People candidates ( 30.74% of all elected mayors nominated by a political party ) were elected village , town or city mayors . Independent candidates won 661 mayoral elections . Although the party had not allowed incumbent MPs but only new ambitious politicians to be their candidate in the 2019 parliamentary election , in the 2020 Ukrainian local elections Servant of the People candidates were incumbent mayors and local council members and ( other ) former members of Party of Regions , Batkivshchyna , Petro Poroshenko Bloc and other political parties . In the elections held in places with a population of less than 10,000 voters the party won 2 seats .",
      "Ideology and positions .",
      "On 23 May 2019 , Ruslan Stefanchuk , Zelenskys representative in the Verkhovna Rada , announced that the party had chosen libertarianism as its core ideology . On 3 June 2019 , however , the head of the partys election office Oleksandr Kornienko claimed , go 20km or 100km out of Kyiv , and nobody will understand the issue of ideology there , who is right , left or centre here . The party will have its manifesto on its website , it will explain everything . After Kornienko was elected as head the party in early November 2019 , he stated that the then party ideology of libertarianism would be changed , which was needed to find a compromise within the party . He claimed that the new party ideology will be something between liberal and socialist views . At the February 2020 Party Congress , Kornienko stated that the partys ideology is Ukrainian centrism . According to him , this is an ideology that denies political extremes and radicalism . But it is creative centrism .",
      "In the election program for the 2019 parliamentary election , the party stated , we will introduce the most favored regime for foreign investors of Ukrainian origin . It also promised to introduce a mechanism for withdrawing deputies who have lost the confidence of the voters . The program also puts forward a number of direct democracy and anti-corruption proposals . The party has also vowed to expand Ukraines cooperation with the European Union and NATO . The party also claimed that its key goal is to achieve a higher than average European income and quality of life for Ukrainians .",
      "In early July 2019 , Ruslan Stefanchuk , number 2 in the partys election list , expressed his belief that Ukrainian language should be promoted ( in a process of the so-called Ukrainization ) but only quite mildly and that one needs to fight for the language to provide quality . Neither by bans , nor by persecution , but only by equality . When Ukrainian language content becomes more interesting and higher quality , then we will absolutely have another attitude . Meanwhile , the state should work out all mechanisms for that , he said .",
      "Critics .",
      "In March 2019 Ukrainian writer and intellectual Yuriy Andrukhovych believed that Volodymyr Zelenskys team was a light version of the Party of Regions .",
      "In December 2018 political commentator Mykhailo Basarab wrote on Den that Zelensky would bring the most trouble to pro-Russian politicians and populists , because he is their closest competitor and will attract part of the pro-Russian and demagogic voters .",

      "Mike Bongiorno",
      "Michael Nicholas Salvatore Bongiorno ( ; May 26 , 1924 \u2013 September 8 , 2009 ) was an Italian-American television host . After a few experiences in the US , he started working on Italian TV in the 1950s and was considered to be the most popular host in Italy . He was also known by the nickname il Re del Quiz ( The Quiz King ) , and the peculiarity of starting all his shows with his trademark greeting : Allegria ! ( Cheers! , Joy! ) .",
      "Early years .",
      "Bongiorno was born in New York City to parents of Italian descent . He moved to Turin ( his mothers native city ) , when he was young . His father was a Sicilian-American lawyer of partial Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb origin . During World War II Mike abandoned his studies and joined a group of Italian partisans . He was captured and spent seven months in the San Vittore prison in Milan and was then deported to a German concentration camp . He was liberated before the end of the war due to an exchange of war prisoners between the United States and Germany . He returned to New York and in 1946 started work at the radio headquarters of Il Progresso Italo-Americano ( The Italian-American Progress ) newspaper .",
      "Career .",
      "Bongiorno returned to Italy in 1953 . He appeared on the first day of official public TV transmissions in Italy with Arrivi e partenze ( Arrivals and Departures ) on the TV channel RAI . From 1955 to 1959 he hosted the quiz show Lascia o raddoppia? , the Italian version of USAs The $64,000 Question .",
      "Another program was Campanile Sera ( Bell Tower Evening , 1959\u20131962 ) , in which southern and northern Italian towns challenged each other with questions , and practical games played by citizens in the same towns .",
      "In 1963 Umberto Eco wrote an essay entitled Phenomenology of Mike Bongiorno , a bestseller in which he used advanced academic theories to shed light on Mike Bongiorno and his way of communicating . Eco held that Mike Bongiorno was so good at portraying himself as no better than average in every respect , that 100% of his audience could feel good about themselves .",
      "Beginning in 1963 , he hosted the first of eleven editions of the Sanremo Festival . Then he hosted the quiz programs Caccia al numero ( Number Hunting , 1962 ) , La Fiera dei Sogni ( Dream Fair , 1962\u20131965 ) and Giochi in Famiglia ( Games in Family , 1966\u20131969 ) . But the greatest success came with the quiz program Rischiatutto ( 1970\u20131974 ) , an adapted Italian version of Jeopardy! , with 20 to 30 million watchers every Thursday night , the highest audience in the history of Italian TV . Other programs hosted by Bongiorno were the news talk show Ieri e Oggi ( Yesterday and Today , 1976 ) and the quiz programs Scommettiamo ?

      "From 1991 to 2001 he hosted Bravo , Bravissimo , a festival featuring preteen musicians , dancers and singers from all over the world . He won 24 Telegatto , the Italian TV prize .",
      "Until 2005 he hosted Genius on Rete 4 , an afternoon quiz show aimed at 12- to 14-year-olds . In 2006 and 2007 he hosted his last quiz show Il Migliore ( Britains Brainiest Kid ) on Rete 4 . More recently , he was also a guest on the second episode of the Gianfranco Funaris show Apocalypse Show on Rai 1 . On December 13 , 2007 , Mike Bongiorno was awarded an honorary degree Honoris Causa by IULM University of Milan . On March 26 , 2009 Bongiorno signed for SKY Italia after Mediaset decided not to renew his contract , where he planned to host a new game show on SKY Uno called RiSKYtutto ( a modern edition of his popular show Rischiatutto ) , which had been scheduled to air in the autumn of 2009 .",
      "Death .",
      "On September 8 , 2009 , at the age of 85 , Mike Bongiorno died of a heart attack , while leaving the Hotel Metropole , Monte-Carlo after a short holiday with his wife Daniela Zuccoli .",
      "His body lay in repose for a few days at the Triennale in Milan before a state funeral was held in the Milan Cathedral on September 12 , 2009 . Many Italian TV stars such as Rosario Fiorello , Pippo Baudo , Fabio Fazio , Sandra Mondaini , Alba Parietti , Paola Barale , Carlo Conti , Gerry Scotti , Marco Columbro and several other entertainers attended the service which was held by Bishop Erminio De Scalzi .",

      "Luis Eduardo Aute",
      "Luis Eduardo Aute Guti\u00e9rrez ( 13 September 1943 \u2013 4 April 2020 ) was a Spanish musician , singer , composer , and film director .",
      "Biography .",
      "First years in the Philippines .",
      "Luis Eduardo Aute was born in Manila on 13 September 1943 . His father , a Catalan ( from Catalonia , Spain ) worked there for a tobacco company since 1919 and married a Spanish Filipina .",
      "In his childhood , Aute studied at the De La Salle School , where he learned English and Tagalog , which is used within his family . At an early age , he showed unusual ability as a painter and sketcher . Another childhood passion was cinema ; his interest in filmmaking was abetted by his parents giving him an 8 mm camera , which he used to produce home-made movies with his friends .",
      "At the age of eight , he made his first trip to Spain . In Madrid , he sang for the first time in public with the Hotel Aveneda orchestra , interpreting the song Las hojas muertas ( The Dead Leaves ) . At age 9 he watched On the Waterfront , a movie that had a powerful influence on him and inspired him to write his first poems in English . Another cinematic influence at that age was the movie Niagara , where he discovered the eroticism and sensuality of Marilyn Monroe .",
      "Return to Spain .",
      "In 1954 , after a short stay in Barcelona , Aute returned definitively to Madrid , where he studied at the Colegio Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Maravillas . At 15 , with his new guitar received as a birthday present , he performed at an end of school party , as part of a trio with two friends . Although he enjoyed music , art remained his primary passion . During these early years he was strongly influenced by German Expressionism and dedicated most of his time to painting , winning a silver medal in a Spanish Juvenile Art Contest .",
      "1960s and 1970s .",
      "Aute initially planned to be an architect but left school almost immediately to pursue a variety of career paths\u2014music , art , and film . He also wrote screenplays and several short stories ( science fiction ) . Aute spent more than a year in France after his military service in Catalan , working mainly in film . One of his first jobs was working as a translator and second assistant of director Joseph L . Mankiewicz for the film Cleopatra .",
      "Music .",
      "When he returned to Spain , he began writing songs for other artists like Massiel ( Rosas en el mar ) . His song Aleluya #1 became a huge hit in the United States when recorded in the United States by Ed Ames as Who Will Answer . Although his friends and colleagues encouraged him to record his own songs , Aute initially refused , saying he didnt enjoy performing publicly .",
      "Eventually , he pushed past his shyness and began a successful career with singles like Don Ram\u00f3n and Made in Spain . His first album was Di\u00e1logos de Rodrigo y Ximena in 1968 . By the 1970s , he was creating soundtracks for films directed by Jaime Ch\u00e1varri , Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga , Fernando Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez , Fernando M\u00e9ndez , and others .",
      "In 1977 , Aute performed in his first large public concert in Spain . Invited by the Cuban government to participate in the World Festival of Youth in Havana , Aute contracted tuberculosis and spent five months in Cuba recovering . This enforced downtime cemented his friendship with a Cuban musician , Silvio Rodr\u00edguez , whom he later shared a concert stage with . That concert , Mano a Mano , became the basis of an international best-selling album .",

In 1974 he wrote and directed A flor de piel , his last short film for over ten years .",
      "Poetry .",
      "Although hed written poetry in both English and Spanish as a youth , Aute made a big splash in 1970 when he published a poem and drawing in Poesia 70 that managed to get the magazine shut down in conservative , Franco-controlled Spain . In 1975 , he publishedLa matem\u00e1tica del espejo and followed it up a year later with Songs and Poems . In 1978 , he published La liturgia del desorden .",

He also developed a series called Animal , which combined poetry , art , and music .",
      "2000 to 2020 .",
      "Music .",
      "In 2000 , a number of Autes peers produced a tribute album called Mira que eres canalla , Aute as a tribute to him .

He also toured with an exhibit called Transfiguraciones that had venues in Cuba , Spain , Colombia , Ecuador , and Italy between 2004 and 2010 . This was followed by a retrospective of his work in Zaragoza . Rarely has a year gone by since his first exhibit in 1960 without an Aute show somewhere in the world .",

      "Alfred Drury",
      "Edward Alfred Briscoe Drury ( 11 November 1856 \u2013 24 December 1944 ) was an English architectural sculptor and artist active in the New Sculpture movement . During a long career Drury created a great number of decorative figures such as busts and statuettes plus larger monuments , war memorials , statues of royalty and architectural pieces . During the opening years of the 20th-century he was among the foremost architectural sculptors active in Britain and in that period created the series of works in central London for which he is perhaps now best known . These include the figures on the Old War Office building in Whitehall , elements of the facade of the Victoria and Albert Museum and four of the colossal statues on Vauxhall Bridge .",
      "Biography .",
      "Education and training .",
      "Drury was born in Islington , London but raised in Oxford , where his father was a pub landlord . Drury studied at the Oxford School of Art and then at the National Art Training School in South Kensington , where his teachers included Jules Dalou and , later , \u00c9douard Lant\u00e9ri . Drury won gold medals in National Art Competitions in 1879 , 1880 and 1881 before moving to Paris where he worked as an assistant to Dalou until 1885 . When he returned to London he worked as an assistant to the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm and began establishing himself as an independent artist . In 1885 Drury showed his first work at the Royal Academy , a terracotta copy of a sculpture by Dilou , The Triumph of Silenus . While his early exhibition pieces , such as 1886s The First Lesson , clearly showed the impact of his time in France , Drury soon became associated with the British New Sculpture movement . Both Circe , from 1895 , and Griselda of 1896 were typical of the allegorical female figures from mythology and literature that were key subjects of the movement and both sculptures were reproduced in several different sizes in both bronze and marble by Drury in subsequent years .",
      "Early commissions .",
      "Alongside work on his exhibition pieces , Drury also began undertaking architectural commissions . In 1897 , for example , he created a set of terracotta spandrels , representing Art and Design , for a coach builders premises , now demolished , at Hammersmith in London and is thought to have completed other projects outside of London at this time for which records have been lost . He is known to have completed the two low-relief bronze plaques , featuring the head of a river god and female figures , installed to mark the opening of the Blackwall Tunnel in 1897 . He collaborated with the architect Inigo Thomas on a decorative scheme for the gardens at Barrow Court near Bristol . Tasked with providing sculptures for twelve pillars along a boundary wall , Drury carved a sequence of female heads from a baby to that of an old women to represent the months of the year from January to December . Drurys original life-size bronze version of Circe was purchased for a park in Leeds and is now in Leeds City Museum . This led to him receiving several commissions in that city , including for the eight lamp standards representing Morning and Evening positioned in Leeds City Square . Drury was awarded a gold medal at the 1900 Paris International Exhibition for a version of Circe and for a bust of a child , The Age of Innocence . In 1905 Drury exhibited a new cast of the Evening head titled Spirit of the Night and in 1911 carved a marble version of the statue .",
      "The architect John Belcher hired Drury , and others , to create the external decoration for Electra House at Moorgate in central London in 1902 , and he also employed him , the following year , to sculpt external features for the nearby offices of the Royal London Friendly Society in Finsbury Square . For the latter scheme Drury carved several female faces and half-figures including a large keystone figure above the main entrance , consisting of the head of a woman wearing a bronze helmet and framed by oak and ivy branches . The model for this composition was shown at the Royal Academy in 1904 and was widely praised .",
      "Major works .",
      "By 1904 Drury had become established as one of the foremost architectural sculptors active in Britain at the time and this led to the series of commissions for which he is perhaps best known , for the War Office in Whitehall , for the facade of the Victoria and Albert Museum and for Vauxhall Bridge .",
      "For the Old War Office Building on Horse Guards Avenue and Whitehall , Drury created four groups of two seated , twice life-size , female figures in Portland stone during 1904 and 1905 . The pairs were The Sorrow of Peace opposite The Winged Messinger of Peace , the Horrors of War against the Dignity of War , Truth and Justice plus Victory and Fame . The artistic choices Drury made with the pairings and the amount of detail he incorporated into the carvings drew much attention in the newspaper coverage of the new building . For example , the War pairing contrasted a figure of Minerva holding a sword and shield with a more fearful figure holding a skull while some of the figures had gilded bronze attachments such as Victory who holds a small gilded statuette and Truth who has a gilded mirror . Although the works were 70 feet above street level it was reported that crowds of sightseers gathered to view them .",
      "In late 1904 the London County Council commissioned Drury and F . W . Pomeroy to each create four colossal bronze figures for niches on the piers supporting the new Vauxhall Bridge . For the eastern , downstream , side of the bridge Drury created four female figures representing the Fine Arts , holding a statuette and palette , Science holding a globe , Education and Local Government .",
      "By March 1905 Aston Webb , the architect of the Cromwell Road extension to the Victoria and Albert Museum had commissioned over twenty sculptors to provide statues , carvings and decorations for the facade of the building . Webb allocated what he considered the",
      "most prominent areas to Drury and George Frampton . The area over the main entrance arch was assigned to Frampton who created spandrel figures of Truth and Beauty for the space . The area under the arch and the remainder of the main entrance were allocated to Drury . Within the curve of entrance arch he created nine low-relief panels featuring kneeling or crouching female figures holding plaques with gold lettering that when read together form a quotation from Sir Joshua Reynolds . Below the arch , and immediately above the main entrance , is his statue of Albert , Prince Consort and above the arch is Drurys statue of Queen Victoria , carrying a staff and flanked by figures of St George and St Michael . Drurys work was singled out for praise in art press reviews when the overall scheme was completed in 1908 . The same year Webb commissioned Drury to produce a relief panel , of children at play , for the new offices of the Grand Trunk Railway Company in Cockspur Street in central London .",
      "Exhibition record .",
      "Drury was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1900 and a full Academician in 1913 . He exhibited works at the Academy each year from 1885 to 1942 and at the Royal Scottish Academy between 1903 and 1917 . He also showed works at the Aberdeen Artists Society , the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and at Leeds City Art Gallery on a regular basis . He was also a member of the International Society of Sculptors , Painters and Gravers . In 1932 Drury received the Royal Society of British Sculptors silver medal for his statue of Joshua Reynolds in the courtyard of Burlington House in London .",

      "Maurizio Sarri",
      "Maurizio Sarri ( ; born 10 January 1959 ) is an Italian professional football manager who most recently managed club Juventus .",
      "Sarri did not play football professionally , taking part as an amateur centre back and coach while working as a banker . In 2005 , he had his first Serie B job at Pescara . In 2014 , Sarri won promotion to Serie A with Empoli , and after preserving their place in the top flight he was hired by Napoli . He won several individual awards while managing the Naples-based club ; after finishing as league runners-up in 2017\u201318 , Sarri moved to English club Chelsea , where he won the UEFA Europa League in his only season with the club . He returned to Italy to coach Juventus in 2019 , with whom he went on to win the Serie A title in his first season , becoming the oldest manager to ever win the Serie A .",
      "Early life .",
      "Sarri was born in the Bagnoli district of Naples to workers at Italsider . He was raised in Castro ( province of Bergamo ) and then in Faella ( municipality of Castelfranco Piandisc\u00f2 , in the province of Arezzo ) , where he divided his time as an amateur footballer and banker for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena in Tuscany . His work as a banker saw him travel Europe , working in London , Z\u00fcrich and Luxembourg .",
      "A centre back , He completed the Italian Liceo classico in Figline Valdarno , having David Ermini as his deskmate .",
      "Sarri played only at an amateur level , in Figlines local team , having failed trials with Torino and Fiorentina . At the age of 19 , Montevarchi was close to signing Sarri but Figline asked for a compensation of 50 million lire , and the deal eventually collapsed . He later refused a move to Pontedera , and subsequently retired with Figline after struggling with injuries .",
      "Sarri used to work in the bank in the morning , and trained and played in games in the afternoon and evening . In 1990 , aged 30 , he transitioned into coaching , following the same schedule he adhered to for his entire work life . After gaining employment with minor side Tegoleto , he decided to quit his job to devote himself exclusively to his coaching career .",
      "Managerial career .",
      "Early career .",
      "Sarris first club as manager was U.S.D . Stia 1925 , whom he started coaching in 1990 in Seconda Categoria . In the following year he was appointed manager of fellow league team U.S . Faellese , and took the club up to the Promozione .",
      "Sarri subsequently worked for U.S.D . Cavriglia and U.S . Antella , taking both sides to the Eccellenza . In 1998 he was named manager of fellow league team A.C . Valdema , but was fired the following January . He took over U.S.D . Tegoleto in the same division in September 1999 .",
      "In 2000 , Sarri signed for Sansovino in Eccellenza , and achieved promotion to Serie D with the side in his first season ; he would remain two further seasons in charge of the club , reaching the play-offs in his last season . His successes with Sansovino caused Serie C2 side Sangiovannese to sign him in 2003 , where he remained for two seasons and took the club to Serie C1 in his first campaign .",
      "On 18 June 2005 , Sarri resigned from Sangiovannese , and was appointed manager of Serie B side Pescara on 9 July . After avoiding relegation , he left the club on 30 June 2006 and was appointed at the helm of fellow second division side Arezzo on 1 November , in the place of the sacked Antonio Conte . On 13 March 2007 , he was relieved from his duties , and Conte returned to the post .",
      "On 18 July 2007 Sarri joined Avellino in the second tier , but resigned on 23 August after severe altercations with the clubs board . On 31 December he replaced fired Davide Pellegrini at the helm of Hellas Verona , but was himself sacked the following 28 February after winning only one point during his six matches in charge .",
      "On 23 September 2008 , Sarri was named Perugia manager in the place of Giovanni Pagliari . Sacked on 15 February of the following year , he only returned to coaching duties on 24 March 2010 with Grosseto . On 6 July of that year Sarri was appointed manager of Alessandria in Lega Pro Prima Divisione , and reached the promotion play-offs , being knocked out in the semifinals by Salernitana .",
      "Sarri resigned from Alessandria on 24 June 2011 , and on 6 July 2011 , he was appointed at the helm of Sorrento . He coached the club through the first months of the season until the mid-season break , playing an attractive , slick brand of attacking football . Despite the clubs being in sixth place , he was dismissed on 13 December .",
      "Empoli .",
      "On 25 June 2012 , Tuscan Serie B club Empoli hired Sarri as their new coach . In his first season , he led the club to fourth place and the playoff final , before losing to local rivals Livorno .",
      "The following season , Sarri guided Empoli to second place in the final table and direct promotion to Serie A after six years away . In the 2014\u201315 Serie A , Empoli avoided relegation by coming 15th .",
      "Napoli .",
      "On 11 June 2015 , Sarri left Empoli and signed for the club of his city of birth , Napoli , replacing Rafael Ben\u00edtez , who left after missing out on a UEFA Champions League place .",
      "In his first season , Sarri brought in Elseid Hysaj , Pepe Reina , and Allan . The trio would go on to be first-team stalwarts for the following campaign , as Napoli finished runners-up to Juventus . Sarri extended his stay at the club until 2020 on 27 May 2016 . Two months later , Juventus would manage to sign Gonzalo Higua\u00edn from Napoli for \u20ac90 million in the summer , who had managed to equal the record for most goals scored in a singular Serie A season , with 36 . However , Sarri vetoed the possibility of spending the money on a like-for-like replacement , instead , spending sparingly on weaker positions in the side to improve on depth , while tinkering with his squad to compensate for the loss of Higua\u00edn . This was achieved through the positional change of Dries Mertens , originally a wide-forward , who was played more centrally the following season . This worked to great effect , as the Belgian netted 28 goals as the club finished third in 2017 , while Sarri was voted the leagues coach of the year , and received the Enzo Bearzot Award .",
      "Sarri , whose Napoli side had concluded the first half of the 2015\u201316 season Serie A in first place , gained the title Campioni dInverno ( Winter Champions ) for the first time in 26 years . Although Napoli ultimately ended the season in third place , the teams results in the first half of the season led him to believe he had constructed a side capable of winning the league the following season . Napoli would begin the 2017\u201318 season in hot form , setting a team record for most consecutive league victories , with 8 . It also took the club until December to register a league defeat , while waiting three months for another , registering ten straight victories in the process . The club also regained the title of Campioni dInverno from the previous campaign . Napoli finished the 2017\u201318 Serie A season in second place , four points behind Juventus . On 23 May 2018 , Sarri was replaced as head coach by Carlo Ancelotti .",
      "Chelsea .",
      "On 14 July 2018 , Sarri was appointed head coach of Chelsea , replacing Antonio Conte who was sacked the day before . In his first competitive game on 5 August , the team lost the Community Shield 2\u20130 to Manchester City at Wembley Stadium . The following week , he recorded his first win as Chelsea manager in a 3\u20130 league win away to Huddersfield Town . Sarri became the first head coach or manager to remain undefeated throughout his first 12 Premier League fixtures , until 24 November , where they lost 3\u20131 to Tottenham Hotspur .",
      "During the 2019 EFL Cup Final against cup holders Manchester City , with the match at 0\u20130 and a penalty shootout imminent , Sarri called for goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga to be substituted off for Willy Caballero ; formerly of City , and whose penalty saves won City the same competition in 2016 . However , Arrizabalaga refused to be substituted . An irate Sarri nearly stormed into the stadium tunnel , and was later held back by Chelsea defender Antonio R\u00fcdiger from confronting the keeper . Chelsea went on to lose the shoot-out 3\u20134 . After the game , both Arrizabalaga and Sarri said that the situation was a misunderstanding , with Sarri believing that Arrizabalaga was too injured with a cramp to continue , but Arrizabalaga felt okay to continue . On 29 May , Sarri won his first major trophy as a manager after Chelsea beat Arsenal 4\u20131 in the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final in Baku . Chelsea managed to win the title undefeated throughout the entirety of the Europa League campaign .",
      "At the end of the 2018\u201319 season , Chelsea announced that Sarri was departing to become manager of Juventus , with the club statement also mentioning his desire to be closer to his elderly parents in Italy .",
      "Juventus .",
      "On 16 June 2019 , Juventus announced the signing of Sarri on a three-year contract . In August 2019 , he was treated for pneumonia ; he would miss the first two matches of the 2019\u201320 season over Parma and Napoli .",
      "Under Sarris management , Juventus participated in the 2019 Supercoppa Italiana on 22 December following their league title victory in the previous season , where they lost 1\u20133 against Lazio at the King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh .",
      "On 17 June 2020 , Juventus suffered a 4\u20132 penalty shoot defeat to Sarris former club Napoli in the Coppa Italia Final , following a 0\u20130 draw after regulation time . On 26 July , Juventus secured a ninth straight Serie A title with a 2\u20130 home win over Sampdoria . The result saw Sarri win his first major trophy in Italian football , also saw him become the oldest manager to win the Serie A at the age of , breaking the previous record set by Nils Liedholm with Roma in 1982\u201383 ( 60 years and 219 days ) . On 8 August 2020 , one day after Juventus were eliminated from the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League in the round of 16 by Lyon , Sarri was sacked by the club .",
      "Style of management .",
      "From a tactical standpoint , Sarri is known for his intelligence , attention to detail , and his meticulous approach as a manager when it comes to preparing matches during weekly training sessions . He often has his team prepare many different plays on set-pieces . One of the main trademarks of his highly organised system is a four-man back-line ; his teams usually play a high defensive line and adopt the offside trap and a zonal marking system , as he requires his defensive players to be synchronised in their movements , anticipate plays , and look at the ball as a point of reference , not their opponents . Other key elements of Sarris line-up are the presence of a deep-lying playmaker who dictates play in front of the back-line , such as Jorginho , and overlapping attacking full backs , in order to provide width to his team , as his players often attack from the flank , looking to play quick exchanges and make runs in behind into the box rather than deliver crosses into the area , however . As such , he favours dynamic wingers in his team , as well as defenders and goalkeepers who are comfortable on the ball , in order to help his team retain possession , and hard-working players who can implement his high pressing game .",
      "On the ball , Sarris teams are known for playing an attractive , exciting , and attacking-minded brand of football , based on retaining possession , movement off the ball , and many quick , short passes on the ground ; this style has come to be known as Sarri-ball or liquid football in the media , while L\u00c9quipe has described it as vertical tiki-taka . The Italian encyclopaedia Treccani instead coined the term Sarrismo to describe the offensive and spectacular style of football that Sarris teams play . Sarris teams modern , innovative , and creative playing style , as well as their mentality , ability to move up the pitch quickly on counter-attacks and score many goals , has won praise from several pundits , players , and managers , including Pep Guardiola and Cesc F\u00e0bregas ; in 2018 , former manager Arrigo Sacchi praised the style employed by Sarris Napoli side as the most important thing seen in Italy in the last 20 years . However , despite receiving plaudits for his tactical approach to the game , he also initially came under criticism from some in the sport for his failure to win a title as a manager , until leading Chelsea to victory in the Europa League in 2019 ; he has also been accused in the media of being stubborn and tactically inflexible at times . When defending off the ball , Sarris teams often employ an aggressive use of energetic pressing , tight lines , and pressure high up the pitch in order to win back the ball quickly . Throughout his coaching career , Sarri has adopted several formations , such as the 4\u20133\u20131\u20132 or the 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 , but he later came to be known for using a free-flowing , possession based 4\u20133\u20133 system during his time with Napoli . During the 2016\u201317 season , following the departure of Gonzalo Higua\u00edn to rivals Juventus and an injury to the clubs main striker Arkadiusz Milik , Sarri frequently deployed Dries Mertens in a false nine role , seemingly positioned as a lone centre-forward , rather than as a left winger , where he had previously faced competition from Lorenzo Insigne for a starting role ; as a result of Sarris tactical change , Mertenss goalscoring output increased dramatically .",
      "Sarri received his coaching diploma in 2006 through the Technical Centre of Coverciano ; the title of his thesis was La preparazione settimanale della partita ( The weekly preparation of a match ) . One of his major influences as a coach is Arrigo Sacchi . Aside from his tactical prowess , Sarri is known for his outspokenness as a manager . He has also stood out for his attire ; unlike many other managers who wore suits in Italian football , he usually wore a tracksuit during matches . At Chelsea , he also adopted a more relaxed approach than his predecessor Antonio Conte when it came to his players diets and curfew before matches , which along with the changes in tactics to a more offensive-minded , possession game based on passing , helped create a more positive team environment ; Chelsea defender Antonio R\u00fcdiger has praised Sarri for the changes he implemented at the team . Regarding his management style , Sarri commented in his first press conference with Chelsea : My goal is to have fun as long as I am here and be competitive in all competitions until the end . Ours is not a sport but a game , and anybody who plays a game starts doing that when theyre young . It is fun . The child in each of us must be nurtured because this often makes us the best . I think if a team has fun often , the fans do too . This is very important , and then there are the high-level objectives , but we must start by having fun . This is important for us and our fans .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Sarri is a smoker and in 2018 , Napolis UEFA Europa League opponents , RB Leipzig , built a special smoking section in the locker-room area of their stadium , Red Bull Arena , specifically for him . He often chews on cigarette butts while on the touch-line .",
      "In addition to his native Italian , Sarri also speaks English albeit with the help of an interpreter in some English interviews .",
      "Controversy .",
      "During the 2015\u201316 season , Sarri found himself embroiled in a heated exchange with Roberto Mancini , then head coach of Inter Milan , in the final minutes of a Coppa Italia match on 20 January 2016 , where Mancini accused Sarri of directing a homophobic slur at him . Sarri responded to the accusations by saying that he was not a homophobe , stating what happens on the field , stays on the field . Sarri was consequently fined \u20ac20,000 and banned for two Coppa Italia matches by Lega Serie A for directing extremely insulting epithets at the coach of the opposing team .",
      "In March 2018 , Sarri came under further criticism in the media when he was accused of making sexist comments when responding to female reporter Titti Improta of Canale 21 , who had asked him in a post-match interview if he thought that Napolis title challenge had been compromised ; he subsequently apologised , later also adding that he had been joking .",
      "When asked about these two incidents in his first press conference with Chelsea in 2018 , Sarri expressed regret regarding his behaviour , commenting : These were mistakes , that is for sure . I think that those who know me very well cannot define me in this way \u2013 not homophobic or sexist or racist , absolutely not . I am an extremely open person , and I do not have these kinds of problems , and I hope to show this when I work here and live here .",

      "Audie Murphy",
      "Audie Leon Murphy ( 20 June 1925 \u2013 28 May 1971 ) was an American soldier , actor , songwriter , and rancher . He was one of the most decorated American combat soldiers of World War II . He received every military combat award for valor available from the U.S . Army , as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism . Murphy received the Medal of Honor for valor that he demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off a company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945 , then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition .",
      "Murphy was born into a large family of sharecroppers in Hunt County , Texas . His father abandoned them , and his mother died when he was a teenager . Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick cotton and find other work to help support his family ; his skill with a hunting rifle helped feed his family .",
      "After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 , Murphys older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military . Turned down initially for being underweight by the Army , Navy and the Marine Corps , he eventually was able to enlist in the Army . He first saw action in the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily ; then in 1944 he participated in the Battle of Anzio , the liberation of Rome , and the invasion of southern France . Murphy fought at Mont\u00e9limar and led his men on a successful assault at LOmet quarry near Cleurie in north-eastern France in October .",
      "After the war , Murphy embarked on a 21-year acting career . He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film To Hell and Back , based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name , but most of his roles were in westerns . He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith . Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter . He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona , and became a regular participant in horse racing .",
      "Suffering from what would today be described as post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow . He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills . In his last few years , he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example . Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971 , which was shortly before his 46th birthday . He was interred with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery , where his grave is one of the most visited .",
      "Early life .",
      "Audie Murphy was born on 20 June 1925 , in Kingston , a small rural community in Hunt County in northeastern Texas . He was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy ( 1887\u20131976 ) and his wife Josie Bell Murphy ( n\u00e9e Killian ; 1891\u20131941 ) . The Murphys were sharecroppers of Irish descent .",
      "As a child , Murphy was a loner with mood swings and an explosive temper . He grew up in northeastern Texas around the towns of Farmersville , Greenville , and Celeste , where he attended elementary school . His father drifted in and out of the familys life and eventually deserted them . Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day ( ) to help support his family ; he also became skilled with a rifle , hunting small game to help feed them . After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941 , he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store , garage and gas station in Greenville . Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Childrens Home , a Christian orphanage in Quinlan . After the war , he bought a house in Farmersville for his eldest sister Corinne and her husband , Poland Burns . His other siblings briefly shared the home .",
      "The loss of his mother stayed with Murphy throughout his life . He later stated :",
      "World War II service .",
      "Murphy had always wanted to be a soldier . After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 , he tried to enlist , but the Army , Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage . After his sister provided an affidavit that falsified his birth date by a year , he was accepted by the U.S . Army on 30 June 1942 . After basic training at Camp Wolters , he was sent to Fort Meade for advanced infantry training . During basic training , he earned the Marksman Badge with Rifle Component Bar and Expert Badge with Bayonet Component Bar .",
      "Mediterranean Theater .",
      "Murphy was shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco on 20 February 1943 . He was assigned to Company B , 1st Battalion , 15th Infantry Regiment , 3rd Infantry Division , which trained under the command of Major General Lucian Truscott . He participated as a platoon messenger with his division at Arzew in Algeria in rigorous training for the Allied assault landings in Sicily . He was promoted to private first class on 7 May and corporal on 15 July .",
      "When the 3rd Infantry landed at Licata , Sicily , on 10 July , Murphy was a division runner . On a scouting patrol , he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicatt\u00ec . Sidelined with illness for a week when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July , he rejoined them when they were assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement , while the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina .",
      "Murphy participated in the September 1943 mainland Salerno landing at Battipaglia . While on a scouting party along the Volturno River , he and two other soldiers were ambushed ; German machine gun fire killed one soldier . Murphy and the other survivor responded by killing five Germans with hand grenades and machine gun fire . While taking part in the October Allied assault on the Volturno Line , near Mignano Monte Lungo Hill 193 , he and his company repelled an attack by seven German soldiers , killing three and taking four prisoner . Murphy was promoted to sergeant on 13 December .",
      "In January 1944 , Murphy was promoted to staff sergeant . He was hospitalized in Naples with malaria on 21 January and was unable to participate in the initial landing at the Anzio beachhead . He returned on 29 January and participated in the First Battle of Cisterna , and was made a platoon sergeant in Company B following the battle . He returned with the 3rd Division to Anzio , where they remained four months . Taking shelter from the weather in an abandoned farmhouse on 2 March , Murphy and his platoon killed the crew of a passing German tank . He then crawled out alone close enough to destroy the tank with rifle grenades , for which he received the Bronze Star with V device .",
      "Murphy continued to make scouting patrols to take German prisoners before being hospitalized for a week on 13 March with a second bout of malaria . Sixty-one infantry officers and enlisted men of Company B , 15th Infantry , including Murphy , were awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge on 8 May .",
      "Murphy was awarded a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Bronze Star . American forces liberated Rome on 4 June , and Murphy remained bivouacked in Rome with his platoon throughout July .",
      "European Theater .",
      "During the first wave of the Allied invasion of southern France , Murphy received the Distinguished Service Cross for action taken on 15 August 1944 .",
      "After landing on Yellow Beach near Ramatuelle , Murphys platoon was making its way through a vineyard when the men were attacked by German soldiers . He retrieved a machine gun that had been detached from the squad and returned fire at the German soldiers , killing two and wounding one . Two Germans exited a house about away and appeared to surrender ; when Murphys best friend responded , they shot and killed him . Murphy advanced alone on the house under direct fire . He killed six , wounded two and took 11 prisoner .",
      "Murphy was with the 1st Battalion , 15th Infantry Regiment during the 27\u201328 August offensive at Mont\u00e9limar that secured the area from the Germans . Along with the other soldiers who took part in the action , he received the Presidential Unit Citation .",
      "Murphys first Purple Heart was for a heel wound received in a mortar shell blast on 15 September 1944 in northeastern France . His first Silver Star came after he killed four and wounded three at a German machine gun position on 2 October at LOmet quarry in the Cleurie river valley . Three days later , Murphy crawled alone towards the Germans at LOmet , carrying an SCR-536 radio and directing his men for an hour while the Germans fired directly at him . When his men finally took the hill , 15 Germans had been killed and 35 wounded . Murphys actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star . He was awarded a battlefield commission to second lieutenant on 14 October , which elevated him to platoon leader . While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October , the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group . Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper ; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes . At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence , the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and kept him out of combat until January . Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury .",
      "The Colmar Pocket , in the Vosges Mountains , had been held by German troops since November 1944 . On 14 January 1945 , Murphy rejoined his platoon , which had been moved to the Colmar area in December . He moved with the 3rd Division on 24 January to the town of Holtzwihr , where they faced a strong German counterattack . He was wounded in both legs , for which he received a second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart . As the company awaited reinforcements on 26 January , he was made commander of Company B .",
      "The Germans scored a direct hit on an M10 tank destroyer , setting it alight , forcing the crew to abandon it . Murphy ordered his men to retreat to positions in the woods , remaining alone at his post , shooting his M1 carbine and directing artillery fire via his field radio while the Germans aimed fire directly at his position . Murphy mounted the abandoned , burning tank destroyer and began firing its .50 caliber machine gun at the advancing Germans , killing a squad crawling through a ditch towards him . For an hour , Murphy stood on the flaming tank destroyer returning German fire from foot soldiers and advancing tanks , killing or wounding 50 Germans . He sustained a leg wound during his stand , and stopped only after he ran out of ammunition . Murphy rejoined his men , disregarding his own injury , and led them back to repel the Germans . He insisted on remaining with his men while his wounds were treated .",
      "For his actions that day , he was awarded the Medal of Honor . The 3rd Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions at the Colmar Pocket , giving Murphy a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for the emblem .",
      "On 16 February , Murphy was promoted to first lieutenant and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service from 22 January 1944 to 18 February 1945 . He was moved from the front lines to Regimental Headquarters and made a liaison officer .",
      "Decorations .",
      "The United States additionally honored Murphys war contributions with the American Campaign Medal , the European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with arrowhead device and 9 campaign stars , the World War II Victory Medal , and the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp . France recognized his service with the French Legion of Honor \u2013 Grade of Chevalier , the French Croix de guerre with Silver Star , the French Croix de guerre with Palm , the French Liberation Medal and the French Fourrag\u00e8re in Colors of the Croix de guerre , which was authorized for all members of the 3rd Infantry Division who fought in France during World War II . Belgium awarded Murphy the Belgian Croix de guerre with 1940 Palm .",
      "Brigadier General Ralph B . Lovett and Lieutenant Colonel Hallet D . Edson recommended Murphy for the Medal of Honor . Near Salzburg , Austria on 2 June 1945 , Lieutenant General A.M . Patch presented Murphy with the Medal of Honor and Legion of Merit for his actions at Holtzwihr . When asked after the war why he had seized the machine gun and taken on an entire company of German infantry , he replied , They were killing my friends .",
      "Murphy received every U.S . military combat award for valor available from the U.S . Army for his World War II service .",
      "Postwar military service .",
      "Inquiries were made through official channels about the prospect of Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States , but he never enrolled . According to author Don Graham , Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it , possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam .",
      "Murphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas , for temporary duty and reassignment . Upon arrival on 13 June , he was one of four assigned to Fort Sam Houston Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station and sent home for 30 days of recuperation , with permission to travel anywhere within the United States during that period . While on leave , Murphy was feted with parades , banquets , and speeches . He received a belated Good Conduct Medal on 21 August .",
      "He was discharged with the rank of first lieutenant at a 50 percent disability classification on 21 September and transferred to the Officers Reserve Corps .",
      "Post-traumatic stress .",
      "Since his military service , Murphy had been plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression , and he slept with a loaded pistol under his pillow . A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches , vomiting , and nightmares about the war . His medical records indicated that he took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares . During the mid-1960s , he recognized his dependence on the sedative Placidyl , and locked himself alone in a hotel room for a week to successfully break the addiction . Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness , and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming . His first wife , Dixie Wanda Hendrix , claimed he once held her at gunpoint . She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans . Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge . His poem The Crosses Grow on Anzio appeared in his book To Hell and Back , but was attributed to the fictitious character Kerrigan .",
      "To draw attention to the problems of returning Korean War and Vietnam War veterans , Murphy spoke out candidly about his own problems with posttraumatic stress disorder . It was known during Murphys lifetime as battle fatigue and shell shock , terminology that dated back to World War I . He called on the government to give increased consideration and study to the emotional impact of combat experiences , and to extend health care benefits to war veterans . As a result of legislation introduced by U.S . Congressman Olin Teague five months after Murphys death in 1971 , the Audie L . Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio , now a part of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System , was dedicated in 1973 .",
      "Texas Army National Guard .",
      "At the end of World War II , the 36th Infantry Division reverted to state control as part of the Texas Army National Guard , and Murphys friends , Major General H . Miller Ainsworth and Brigadier General Carl L . Phinney , were the 36ths commander and deputy commander respectively . After 25 June 1950 commencement of the Korean War , Murphy began a second military career and was commissioned as a captain in the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard . He drilled new recruits in the summer training camps , and granted the Guard permission to use his name and image in recruiting materials . Although he wanted to join the fighting and juggled training activities with his film career , the 36th Infantry Division was never sent to Korea .",
      "At his request , he transferred to inactive status on 1 October 1951 because of his film commitments with MGM Studios , and returned to active status in 1955 . Murphy was promoted to the rank of major by the Texas Army National Guard in 1956 and returned to inactive status in 1957 . In 1969 , his official separation from the Guard transferred him to the United States Army Reserve . He remained with the USAR until his transfer to the Retired Reserve in 1969 .",
      "Film career .",
      "Throughout an acting career spanning from 1948 to 1969 , Murphy made more than 40 feature films and one television series . When actor and producer James Cagney saw the 16 July 1945 issue of Life magazine depicting Murphy as the most decorated soldier , he brought him to Hollywood . Cagney and his brother William signed him as a contract player for their production company and gave him training in acting , voice and dance . They never cast Murphy in a movie and a personal disagreement ended the association in 1947 . Murphy later worked with acting coach Estelle Harman , and honed his diction by reciting dialogue from William Shakespeare and William Saroyan .",
      "Murphy moved into Terry Hunts Athletic Club in Hollywood where he lived until 1948 . Hollywood writer David Spec McClure befriended Murphy , collaborating with him on Murphys 1949 book To Hell and Back . McClure used his connections to get a $500 ( ) bit part in Texas , Brooklyn & Heaven ( 1948 ) for Murphy . The agent of Wanda Hendrix , whom Murphy had been dating since 1946 , got him a bit part in the Alan Ladd film Beyond Glory directed by John Farrow earlier that same year . His 1949 film Bad Boy gave him his first leading role . The films financial backers refused to bankroll the project unless Murphy was given the lead ; thus , Allied Artists put aside their reservations about using an inexperienced actor and gave him the starring role .",
      "Universal Studios signed Murphy to a seven-year studio contract at $2,500 a week ( ) . His first film for them was as Billy the Kid in The Kid from Texas in 1950 . He wrapped up that year making Sierra starring Wanda Hendrix , who by that time had become his wife , and Kansas Raiders as outlaw Jesse James . Universal lent him to MGM in 1951 at a salary of $25,000 to play the lead of The Youth in The Red Badge of Courage , directed by John Huston . Murphy and Huston worked together again in the 1960 film The Unforgiven .",
      "The only film Murphy made in 1952 was The Duel at Silver Creek with director Don Siegel . Murphy worked with Siegel one more time in 1958 for The Gun Runners . In 1953 , he starred in Frederick de Cordovas Column South , and played Jim Harvey in Nathan Jurans Tumbleweed , an adaptation of the Kenneth Perkins novel Three Were Renegades . Director Nathan Juran also directed Gunsmoke and Drums Across the River . George Marshall directed Murphy in the 1954 Destry , a remake of Destry Rides Again , based on a character created by author Max Brand .",
      "Although Murphy was initially reluctant to appear as himself in To Hell and Back , the 1955 adaptation of his book directed by Jesse Hibbs , he eventually agreed ; it became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time . To help publicize the release of the film , he made guest appearances on television shows such as Whats My Line? , Toast of the Town , and Colgate Comedy Hour . The Hibbs-Murphy team proved so successful in To Hell and Back that the two worked together on five subsequent films . The partnership resulted in Murphy appearing as John Phillip Clum in the 1956 western Walk the Proud Land , and the non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner . They worked together for the last time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail .",
      "Joseph L . Mankiewicz hired Murphy to play the titular role in the 1958 film The Quiet American . Murphy formed a partnership with Harry Joe Brown to make three films , starting with The Guns of Fort Petticoat ( 1957 ) . The partnership fell into disagreement over the remaining two projects , and Brown filed suit against Murphy .",
      "In 1957 Murphy was cast as The Utica Kid along with James Stewart and Dan Duryea in the western Night Passage .",
      "Murphy was featured in three westerns in 1959 : he starred opposite Sandra Dee in The Wild and the Innocent , collaborated as an uncredited co-producer with Walter Mirisch on the black and white Cast a Long Shadow , and performed as a hired killer in No Name on the Bullet , a film that was well received by critics . Thelma Ritter was his costar in the 1960 Startime television episode The Man . During the early 1960s , Murphy donated his time and otherwise lent his name and image for three episodes of The Big Picture television series produced by the United States Army . He received the 1960 Outstanding Civilian Service Medal for his cooperation in the episode Broken Bridge , which featured his visits to military installations in Germany , Italy , Turkey and the U.S . state of New Mexico to showcase the militarys latest weaponry .",
      "Writer Clair Huffaker wrote the 1961 screenplays for Murphys films Seven Ways from Sundown and Posse from Hell . Willard W . Willingham and his wife Mary Willingham befriended Murphy in his early days in Hollywood and worked with him on a number of projects .",
      "Willard was a producer on Murphys 1961 television series Whispering Smith , and co-wrote the screenplay for Battle at Bloody Beach that year . He collaborated on Bullet for a Badman in 1964 and Arizona Raiders in 1965 . The Willinghams as a team wrote the screenplay for Gunpoint as well as the script for Murphys last starring lead in the western 40 Guns to Apache Pass in 1967 . Murphy made Trunk to Cairo in Israel in 1966 .",
      "He first met director Budd Boetticher when Murphy requested to be his boxing partner at Terry Hunts Athletic Club . He subsequently appeared in the 1951 title role of Boettichers first western The Cimarron Kid . Boetticher wrote the script in 1969 for Murphys last film , A Time for Dying . Two other projects that Murphy and Boetticher planned to collaborate on \u2013 A Horse for Mr Barnum and When Theres Sumpthin to Do \u2013 never came to fruition .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Murphy married actress Wanda Hendrix in 1949 . Their divorce became final two years later in 1951 . Four days later , he married former airline stewardess Pamela Opal Lee Archer ( 7 October 1919/1920/1923 \u2013 8 April 2010 ) , with whom he had two sons : Terry Michael ( born 14 March 1952 ) , and James Shannon ( born 1954 ) .",
      "Murphy bred quarter horses at the Audie Murphy Ranch in what is now Menifee , California , and the Murphy Ranch in Pima County , Arizona .",
      "His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack , and he invested large sums of money in the hobby . Murphys gambling left his finances in a poor state . In 1968 , he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes . In spite of his financial difficulties , Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes , mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market .",
      "In May 1970 , he was arrested in Burbank , California , charged with battery and assault with intent to commit murder in a dispute with a dog trainer . He was accused of firing a shot at the man , which he denied . Murphy was cleared of the charges .",
      "Death and commemorations .",
      "On 28 May 1971 , Murphy was killed when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into Brush Mountain , near Catawba , Virginia , west of Roanoke in conditions of rain , clouds , fog and zero visibility . The pilot and four other passengers were also killed .",
      "The aircraft was a twin-engine Aero Commander 680 flown by a pilot who had a private-pilot license and a reported 8,000 hours of flying time , but who held no instrument rating . The aircraft was recovered on 31 May . After her husbands death , Pamela Murphy moved into a small apartment and got a clerk position at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles , where she remained employed for 35 years .",
      "In 1975 , a court awarded Murphys widow , Pamela , and their two children $2.5 million in damages because of the accident .",
      "On 7 June 1971 , Murphy was buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery . In attendance were Ambassador to the U.N . George H . W . Bush , Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland , and many of the 3rd Infantry Division . Murphys gravesite is in Section 46 , headstone number 46-366-11 , located across Memorial Drive from the Amphitheater . A special flagstone walkway was later constructed to accommodate the large number of people who visit to pay their respects . It is the cemeterys second most-visited gravesite , after that of President John F . Kennedy .",
      "The headstones of Medal of Honor recipients buried at Arlington National Cemetery are normally decorated in gold leaf . Murphy previously requested that his stone remain plain and inconspicuous , like that of an ordinary soldier . The headstone contains the birth year 1924 , based upon purportedly falsified materials among his military records . In 1974 , a large granite marker was erected just off the Appalachian Trail at at 3,100 elevation , near the crash site .",

      "Wheel of Fortune ( American game show )",
      "Wheel of Fortune ( often known simply as Wheel ) is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin that debuted in 1975 . The show features a competition in which contestants solve word puzzles , similar to those used in Hangman , to win cash and prizes determined by spinning a giant carnival wheel . The current version of the series , which airs in nightly syndication , premiered on September 19 , 1983 . It stars Pat Sajak and Vanna White as host and co-host . The original version of Wheel was a daytime series on NBC from January 6 , 1975 , to June 30 , 1989 , then on CBS from July 17 , 1989 , to January 11 , 1991 , and again on NBC from January 14 , 1991 , until it was cancelled on September 20 , 1991 , thereby co-existing with the nighttime version from 1983 to 1991 .",
      "The network version was originally hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford . Woolery left in 1981 , and was replaced by Sajak . Sajak left the network version in January 1989 to host his own late-night talk show , while remaining as host of the nighttime Wheel . Sajak was replaced in daytime by Rolf Benirschke , who was in turn replaced by Bob Goen when the network show moved to CBS ; Goen remained as host for the second NBC run . Stafford left in 1982 , and was replaced by White , who remained on the network show for the rest of its run . Sajak and White have hosted the nighttime version since its inception in 1983 . Jim Thornton has been the shows off-camera announcer since 2010 . Charlie ODonnell served as the shows announcer from its debut until 1980 , and again from 1989 until his death in 2010 . Jack Clark announced from 1980 to his death in 1988 , with M . G . Kelly succeeding him until ODonnells return .",
      "Two spin-off versions exist as well . The first was Wheel 2000 , a version featuring child contestants which aired simultaneously on CBS and Game Show Network between 1997 and 1998 ; this versions hosts were David Sidoni and Tanika Ray , the latter in the role of a CGI hostess named Cyber Lucy . The second , Celebrity Wheel of Fortune , began airing on ABC on January 7 , 2021 .",
      "Wheel of Fortune ranks as the longest-running syndicated game show in the United States , with 7,000 episodes taped and aired as of May 10 , 2019 . TV Guide named it the top-rated syndicated series in a 2008 article , and in 2013 , the magazine ranked it at No . 2 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever . The program has also come to gain a worldwide following with sixty international adaptations . The syndicated series 38th season premiered on September 14 , 2020 , and Sajak became the longest-running host of any game show , surpassing Bob Barker , who hosted The Price Is Right from 1972 to 2007 .",
      "Gameplay .",
      "Main game .",
      "The core game is based on Hangman . Each round has a category and a blank word puzzle , with each blank representing a letter in the answer , and punctuation revealed as needed . Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories , and this list has evolved over the course of the series . Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016 . In such rounds , a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category . Contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword by saying them in any order , but contestants may not repeat or add any word ( such as and ) while solving the crossword . The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces , most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900 , plus a top dollar value : $2,500 in round 1 , $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3 , and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds . The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn , both of which forfeit the contestants turn , with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round . Each game features three contestants , or occasionally , three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper . The left scoreboard from the viewers perspective is colored red , the center yellow , and the right blue , with the contestants positions determined by a random selection prior to taping .",
      "A contestant spins the wheel to determine a dollar value and guess a consonant . Calling a correct letter earns the value before the corresponding flipper , multiplied by the number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle . It also allows the contestant to spin again , buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250 , or attempt to solve the puzzle . Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so , until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed . Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt , if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle , calls a letter that has already been called in that round , fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping , or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle . The only exception is the Free Play wedge , on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence , call a free vowel , or attempt to solve the puzzle , with no penalty for a move that would normally result in a lost turn .",
      "In the first three rounds , the wheel contains a Wild Card and a Gift Tag . The Wild Card may be used to call an additional consonant after any turn ( for the amount that the contestant has just spun ) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there . The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from , or $1,000 in cash courtesy of the sponsoring company . A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize . All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges , so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle . The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which , if won and taken to the bonus round , offers an opportunity to play that round for $1 million . A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash , prizes , or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card , which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it . Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds , but it does take away the Wild Card and/or million dollar wedge if either was claimed in a previous round . Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ( $2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams ) have their scores increased to that amount .",
      "Each game also features five toss-up puzzles , which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time , and award cash to whoever rings in with the right answer . The first puzzle , worth $1,000 , determines who the host interviews first ; the second , worth $2,000 , determines who spins first in round 1 . The third through fifth , collectively the Triple Toss-Up , take place prior to the fourth round . In the Triple Toss-Up round , three consecutive Toss-Up puzzles are played , each having the same category and a common theme . Solving any of these awards $2,000 cash , while solving the third also earns the right to start the fourth round . Contestants may only ring in once for each toss-up puzzle , and no cash is awarded if all three contestants fail to solve the puzzle , or if the last letter is revealed . In this case , the contestant closest to the host goes first . In addition to the toss-ups , each game has a minimum of four rounds , with more played if time permits . Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants clockwise from the contestant who began round 1 .",
      "Round 2 features two mystery wedges . Calling a correct letter after landing upon one offers the contestant the chance to accept its face value of $1,000 per letter , or forfeit that amount to flip over the wedge and see whether its reverse side contains a $10,000 cash prize or Bankrupt . Once either mystery wedge is flipped over , the other becomes a standard $1,000 space and cannot be flipped . Round 3 is a prize puzzle , which offers a prize ( usually a trip ) to the contestant who solves it . Starting with season 31 in 2013 , an Express wedge is also placed on the wheel in round 3 . A contestant who lands on this space and calls a consonant that appears in the puzzle receives $1,000 per appearance . The contestant can then either pass and continue the round normally , or play and keep calling consonants for $1,000 each ( without spinning ) and buying vowels for $250 . The Express play ends when the contestant either calls an incorrect letter ( which has the same effect as landing on a Bankrupt wedge ) or solves the puzzle .",
      "The final round is always played at least in part in a speed-up format , in which the host spins the wheel ; each consonant in that round is worth the value at the red contestants arrow plus $1,000 . If this spin lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt , it is edited from the broadcast and the host spins the wheel again . Vowels do not add or deduct money from the contestants scores in the speed-up round . The contestant in control calls one letter , and if it appears in the puzzle , the contestant is given three seconds to attempt to solve . Play proceeds clockwise , starting with the contestant who was in control at the time of the final spin , until the puzzle is solved . The three-second timer does not begin until the hostess has revealed all instances of a called letter and moved aside from the puzzle board , and the contestant may offer multiple guesses on his/her turn . After the speed-up round , the contestant with the highest total winnings wins the game and advances to the bonus round . Contestants who did not solve any puzzles are awarded a consolation prize of $1,000 ( or $2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams ) .",
      "If a tie for first place occurs after the speed-up round , an additional toss-up puzzle is played between the tied contestants . The contestant who solves the toss-up puzzle wins $1,000 , and advances to the bonus round .",
      "Bonus round .",
      "Since season 35 , the winning contestant chooses one of three puzzle categories before the round begins ( prior to season 35 , the category and puzzle were predetermined ) . After doing so , the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize . The puzzle is revealed , as is every instance of the letters R , S , T , L , N , and E . The contestant provides three more consonants and one more vowel . A contestant holding the Wild Card may then choose a fourth consonant . After any instances of those letters are revealed , the contestant has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle . The contestant can offer multiple guesses , as long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires . Whether or not the contestant solves the puzzle , the host opens the envelope at the end of the round to reveal the prize at stake . Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts ( with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000 ) , a vehicle ( or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams ) , and a top prize of $100,000 .",
      "If the contestant has the Million Dollar Wedge , the $100,000 envelope is replaced with a $1,000,000 envelope . The $1,000,000 prize has been awarded three times : to Michelle Loewenstein ( October 14 , 2008 ) , Autumn Erhard ( May 30 , 2013 ) , and Sarah Manchester ( September 17 , 2014 ) . Contestants who win the $1,000,000 may receive it in installments over 20 years , or in a lump sum of that amounts present value . If the contestant did not land on the $1,000,000 , the host reveals the location of the envelope on the prize wheel after the bonus round .",
      "Previous rules .",
      "Originally , after winning a round , contestants spent their winnings on prizes that were presented onstage . At any time during a shopping round , most often if the contestant did not have enough left to buy another prize , a contestant could choose to put his or her winnings either on a gift certificate or on account for use in a later shopping round . However , a contestant lost any money on account by landing on Bankrupt or failing to claim it by not winning subsequent rounds . The shopping element was eliminated from the syndicated version on the episode that aired October 5 , 1987 , both to speed up gameplay and to alleviate the taxes paid by contestants . However , the network version continued to use the shopping element until the end of its first NBC run on June 30 , 1989 .",
      "Before the introduction of toss-up puzzles at the start of the 18th syndicated season in 2000 , the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1 , with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round . In addition , if a tie for first place occurred , an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round . If a tie for first place occurred on the daytime version , all three players returned to continue the game on the next episode , and it counted as a single appearance . The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge , which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel . It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge . Free Spin was retired , and Free Play introduced , at the start of the 27th syndicated season in 2009 . Between September 16 , 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013 , the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge , which had been in several different rounds in its history . The jackpot began at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it . To claim the jackpot , a contestant had to land on the wedge , call a correct letter , and solve the puzzle all in the same turn . In later years , it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot , regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn .",
      "The network version allowed champions to appear for up to five days originally , which was later reduced to three . The syndicated version , which originally retired contestants after one episode , adopted the three-day champion rule at the start of the seventh season in 1989 . In 1996 , this was changed to have the top three winners from the weeks first four shows returned to compete in the Friday Finals . When the jackpot wedge was introduced , it began at $10,000 instead of $5,000 on Fridays . The rules allowing returning champions were eliminated permanently beginning with the syndicated episode aired September 21 , 1998 , and contestants appear only on a single episode , reverting to the pre-1989 rules .",
      "Before December 1981 , the show did not feature a permanent bonus round . However , two experimental bonus rounds were attempted before then . In 1978 , some episodes featured a round known as the Star Bonus , where a star-shaped token was placed on the wheel . Contestants who picked up the token played an additional round at the end of the game to win one of four prizes , whose value determined the difficulty of the puzzle . The contestant provided four consonants and a vowel , and was given 15 seconds to attempt solving . In one week of episodes airing in March 1980 , contestants who won the main game were given 30 seconds to attempt solving a puzzle for a chance to win a luxury automobile , in a week called Super Wheel Bonus Week . When the current bonus round was introduced in 1981 , no letters were provided automatically . The contestant asked for five consonants and a vowel , and then had fifteen seconds to attempt solving the puzzle . Also , bonus prizes were selected by the contestant at the start of the round . The current time limit and rules for letter selection were introduced on October 3 , 1988 . Starting on September 4 , 1989 , the first episode of the seventh syndicated season , bonus prizes were selected by the contestant choosing from one of five envelopes labeled W , H , E , E , and L . One prize was always $25,000 in cash , and the rest were changed weekly . Any prize that was won was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week . During seasons 16 through 18 ( 1998\u20132001 ) , the $25,000 remained in-place the entire week of shows regardless if it was won . At the start of season 19 on September 3 , 2001 , there were three car envelopes and two $25,000 envelopes , which were available the entire week of shows . These envelopes were replaced with the bonus wheel on October 22 , 2001 .",
      "Conception and development .",
      "Merv Griffin conceived Wheel of Fortune using inspiration from Hangman after recalling long car trips as a child , on which he and his sister played Hangman . After he discussed the idea with Merv Griffin Enterprises staff , they thought that the idea would work as a game show if it had a hook . He decided to add a roulette-style wheel because he was always drawn to such wheels when he saw them in casinos . He and MGEs then-president Murray Schwartz consulted an executive of Caesars Palace to find out how to build such a wheel .",
      "When Griffin pitched the idea for the show to Lin Bolen , then the head of NBCs daytime programming division , she approved , but wanted the show to have more glamour to attract the female audience . She suggested that Griffin incorporate a shopping element into the gameplay , and so , in 1973 , he created a pilot episode titled Shoppers Bazaar , with Chuck Woolery as host and Mike Lawrence as announcer . The pilot started with the three contestants being introduced individually , with Lawrence describing the prizes that they chose to play for . The main game was played to four rounds , with the values on the wheel wedges increasing after the second round . Unlike the show it evolved into , Shoppers Bazaar had a vertically mounted wheel , which was spun automatically rather than by the contestants . This wheel lacked the Bankrupt wedge and featured a wedge where a contestant could call a vowel for free , as well as a Your Own Clue wedge that allowed contestants to pick up a rotary telephone and hear a private clue about the puzzle . At the end of the game , the highest-scoring contestant played a bonus round called the Shoppers Special where all the vowels in the puzzle were already there , and the contestant had 30 seconds to call out consonants in the puzzle .",
      "Edd Byrnes , an actor from 77 Sunset Strip , served as host for the second and third pilots , both titled Wheel of Fortune . These pilots were directed by Marty Pasetta , who gave the show a Vegas feel that more closely resembled the look and feel that the actual show ended up having , a wheel that was now spun by the contestants themselves , and a lighted mechanical puzzle board with letters that were now manually turnable . Showcase prizes on these pilots were located behind the puzzle board , and during shopping segments a list of prizes and their price values scrolled on the right of the screen . By the time production began in December 1974 , Woolery was selected to host , the choice being made by Griffin after he reportedly heard Byrnes reciting A-E-I-O-U to himself in an effort to remember the vowels . Susan Stafford turned the letters on Byrnes pilot episodes , a role that she also held when the show was picked up as a series .",
      "Personnel .",
      "Hosts and hostesses .",
      "The original host of Wheel of Fortune was Chuck Woolery , who hosted the series from its 1975 premiere until December 25 , 1981 , save for one week in August 1980 when Alex Trebek hosted in his place . Woolerys departure came over a salary dispute with show creator Merv Griffin , and his contract was not renewed . On December 28 , 1981 , Pat Sajak made his debut as the host of Wheel . Griffin said that he chose Sajak for his odd sense of humor . NBC president and CEO Fred Silverman objected as he felt Sajak , who at the time of his hiring was the weatherman for KNBC , was too local for a national audience . Griffin countered by telling Silverman he would stop production if Sajak was not allowed to become host , and Silverman acquiesced .",
      "Sajak hosted the daytime series until January 9 , 1989 , when he left to host a late-night talk show for CBS . Rolf Benirschke , a former placekicker in the National Football League , was chosen as his replacement and hosted for a little more than five months . Benirschkes term as host came to an end due to NBCs cancellation of the daytime Wheel after fourteen years , with its final episode airing on June 30 , 1989 . When the newly formatted daytime series returned on CBS on July 17 , 1989 , Bob Goen became its host . The daytime program continued for a year and a half on CBS , then returned to NBC on January 14 , 1991 and continued until September 20 , 1991 when it was cancelled for a second and final time .",
      "Susan Stafford was the original hostess , serving in that role from the premiere until October 1982 . Stafford was absent for two extended periods , once in 1977 after fracturing two vertebrae in her back and once in 1979 after an automobile accident . During these two extended absences , former Miss USA Summer Bartholomew was Staffords most frequent substitute , with model Cynthia Washington and comedian Arte Johnson also filling in for Stafford .",
      "After Stafford left to become a humanitarian worker , over two hundred applicants signed up for a nationwide search to be her replacement . Griffin eventually narrowed the list to three finalists , which consisted of Summer Bartholomew , former Playboy centerfold Vicki McCarty , and Vanna White . Griffin gave each of the three women an opportunity to win the job by putting them in a rotation for several weeks after Staffords departure . In December 1982 , Griffin named White as Staffords successor , saying that he felt she was capable of activating the puzzle board letters ( which is the primary role of the Wheel hostess ) better than anyone else who had auditioned . White became highly popular among the young female demographic , and also gained a fanbase of adults interested in her daily wardrobe , in a phenomenon that has been referred to as Vannamania . White also hosted the daytime version until its cancellation in 1991 , except for one week in June 1986 when Stafford returned so that White could recover after her fianc\u00e9 , John Gibson , died in a plane crash .",
      "Sajak and White have starred on the syndicated version continuously as host and hostess , respectively , since it began , except for very limited occasions . During two weeks in January 1991 , Tricia Gist , the girlfriend and future wife of Griffins son Tony , filled in for White when she and her new husband , restaurateur George San Pietro , were honeymooning . Gist returned for the week of episodes airing March 11 through 15 , 1991 , because White had a cold at the time of taping . On an episode in November 1996 , when Sajak proved unable to host the bonus round segment because of laryngitis , he and White traded places for that segment . On the March 4 , 1997 episode , Rosie ODonnell co-hosted the third round with White after ODonnells name was used in a puzzle .",
      "On April 1 , 1997 , Sajak and Alex Trebek traded jobs for the day . Sajak hosted that days edition of Jeopardy ! in place of Trebek . Trebek presided over a special two-contestant Wheel celebrity match between Sajak and White , who were playing for the Boy Scouts of America and the American Cancer Society , respectively . Lesly Sajak , Pats wife , was the guest hostess for the day . In January and February 2011 , the show held a Vanna for a Day contest in which home viewers submitted video auditions to take Whites place for one episode , with the winner determined by a poll on the shows website . The winner of this contest , Katie Cantrell of Wooster , Ohio ( a student at the Savannah College of Art and Design ) , took Whites place for the second and third rounds on the episode that aired March 24 , 2011 .",
      "In November 2019 , three weeks of episodes were taped with White hosting in Sajaks place while he recovered from intestinal surgery . During her time as hostess , several guests appeared at the puzzle board , including costumed performers of Mickey and Minnie Mouse ( during the Secret Santa shows ) , and Maggie Sajak ( Sajaks daughter ) .",
      "Announcers .",
      "Charlie ODonnell was the programs first and longest tenured announcer . In 1980 , NBC was discussing cancelling Wheel and ODonnell agreed to take the position as announcer on The Toni Tennille Show . The network decided against the cancellation but ODonnell decided to honor his commitment and left the series . His replacement was Jack Clark , who added the syndicated series to his responsibilities when it premiered in 1983 and announced for both series until his death in July 1988 . Los Angeles radio personality M . G . Kelly was Clarks replacement , starting on the daytime series in August 1988 and on the syndicated series when its new season launched a month later . Kelly held these positions until ODonnell was able to return to the announcer position , doing so after his duties with Barris Industries came to an end at the end of the 1988\u201389 television season . ODonnell remained with the series until shortly before his death in November 2010 . Don Pardo , Don Morrow , and Johnny Gilbert have occasionally served as substitute announcers .",
      "After ODonnells death , the producers sought a permanent replacement , and a series of substitutes filled out the rest of the season , including Gilbert , John Cramer , Joe Cipriano , Rich Fields , Lora Cain , and Jim Thornton . For the shows twenty-ninth season , which began in 2011 , Thornton was chosen to be the shows fourth announcer .",
      "Production staff .",
      "Wheel of Fortune typically employs a total of 100 in-house production personnel , with 60 to 100 local staff joining them for those episodes that are taped on location . Griffin was the executive producer of the network version throughout its entire run , and served as the syndicated versions executive producer until his retirement in 2000 . Since 1999 , the title of executive producer has been held by Harry Friedman , who had shared his title with Griffin for his first year , and had earlier served as a producer starting in 1995 .",
      "On August 1 , 2019 , Sony Pictures Television announced that Friedman would retire as executive producer of both Wheel and Jeopardy ! at the end of the 2019\u201320 season . On August 29 , 2019 , Sony Pictures Television announced that Mike Richards will replace Friedman at the start of 2020\u201321 season .",
      "John Rhinehart was the programs first producer , but departed in August 1976 to become NBCs West Coast Daytime Program Development Director . Afterwards , his co-producer , Nancy Jones , was promoted to sole producer , and served as such until 1995 , when Friedman succeeded her . In the 15th syndicated season in 1997 , Karen Griffith and Steve Schwartz joined Friedman as producers . They were later promoted to supervising producers , with Amanda Stern occupying Griffiths and Schwartzs former position .",
      "The shows original director was Jeff Goldstein , who was succeeded by Dick Carson ( a brother of Johnny Carson ) in 1978 . Mark Corwin , who had served as associate director under Carson , took over for him upon his retirement at the end of the 1998\u201399 season , and served as such until he himself died in July 2013 ( although episodes already taped before his death continued airing until late 2013 ) . Jeopardy ! director Kevin McCarthy , Corwins associate director Bob Cisneros , and Wheel and Jeopardy ! technical director Robert Ennis filled in at various points until Cisneros became full-time director in November 2013 . Ennis returned as guest director for the weeks airing October 13 through 17 and November 17 through 21 , 2014 , as Cisneros was recovering from neck surgery at the time of taping . With the start of the 33rd season on September 14 , 2015 , Ennis was promoted to full-time director .",
      "Production .",
      "Wheel of Fortune is owned by Sony Pictures Television ( previously known as Columbia TriStar Television , the successor company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises ) . The production company and copyright holder of all episodes to date is Califon Productions , Inc. , which like SPT has Sony Pictures for its active registered agent , and whose name comes from a New Jersey town where Griffin once owned a farm . The rights to distribute the show worldwide are owned by CBS Media Ventures , into which original distributor King World Productions was folded in 2007 .",
      "The show was originally taped in Studio 4 at NBC Studios in Burbank . Upon NBCs 1989 cancellation of the network series , production moved to Studio 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles , where it remained until 1995 . Since then , the show has occupied Stage 11 at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City . Some episodes are also recorded on location , a tradition which began with two weeks of episodes taped at Radio City Music Hall in late 1988 . Recording sessions usually last for five or six episodes in one day .",
      "Set .",
      "Various changes have been made to the basic set since the syndicated versions premiere in 1983 . In 1997 , a large video display was added center stage , which was then upgraded in 2003 as the show began the transition into high-definition broadcasting . In the mid-1990s , the show began a long-standing tradition of nearly every week coming with its own unique theme . As a result , in addition to its generic design , the set also uses many alternate designs , which are unique to specific weekly sets of themed programs . The most recent set design was conceived by production designer Renee Hoss-Johnson , with later modifications by Jody Vaclav . Previous set designers included Ed Flesh and Dick Stiles .",
      "Shoppers Bazaar used a vertically mounted wheel which was often difficult to see on-screen . Ed Flesh , who also designed the sets for The $25,000 Pyramid and Jeopardy! , redesigned the wheel mechanism , in which the wheel lays flat while a camera zooms in from above . The first incarnation of the wheel was mostly made of paint and cardboard , and has since seen multiple design changes . Until the mid-1990s , the wheel spun automatically during the opening and closing of the show . The current incarnation , in use since 2003 , is framed on a steel tube surrounded by Plexiglas panels and contains more than 200 lighting instruments . It is held by a stainless steel shaft with roller bearings . Altogether , the wheel weighs approximately . The wheel , including its light extensions , is in diameter .",
      "The shows original puzzle board had three rows of 13 manually operated trilons , for a total of 39 spaces . On December 21 , 1981 , a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows ( 11 , 13 , 13 , and 11 trilons ) was adopted . This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed at the beginning and end of the round . Each trilon had three sides : a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle , a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed , and a side with a letter on it . While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle , with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present , a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants . On February 24 , 1997 , the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows ( 12 on the top and bottom rows , 14 in the middle two ) . To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay , the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it . The computerized board obviated the stop-downs , allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company .",
      "Although not typically seen by viewers , the set also includes a used letter board that shows contestants which letters are remaining in play , a scoreboard that is visible from the contestants perspective , and a countdown clock . The used letter board is also used during the bonus round , and in at least one case , helped the contestant to see unused letters to solve a difficult puzzle .",
      "Accommodations for COVID-19 pandemic .",
      "In March 2020 , Sony suspended production of the show due to the COVID-19 pandemic . In August 2020 , taping resumed with new safety measures . Taping is currently ongoing .",
      "New episodes tape without studio audiences ; only essential staff and crew are allowed on stage . Personal protective equipment is also provided to everyone behind the scenes for their safety . All staff and crew undergo testing on a regular basis , while contestants are tested before they step onto the set . Additionally , social distancing measures are enforced both on the set and off stage , and Sajaks and the players podiums have thus been widened to allow for greater distance during gameplay . Contestants spin the wheel with a white , tube-like device that fits over the wheels pegs so they do not have to touch the wheel directly ; Sajak also spins the wheel with his own device during the final spin . During the bonus round , Sajak picks up the prize envelope instead of the contestant and remains at the bonus wheel for the duration of the round .",
      "These new episodes began airing September 14 , 2020 when the shows 38th nighttime season premiered . Many season 37 episodes were taped before the pandemic began and before public health authorities had started enforcing current safety regulations . Because these episodes do not employ cautionary measures and were only aired in the middle of the crisis , they were broadcast with a message at the beginning stating that they had been taped before the pandemic started ( as not to mislead audiences into thinking incorrectly that the producers were ignoring public health advice ) .",
      "Music .",
      "Alan Thicke composed the shows original theme , which was titled Big Wheels . In 1983 , it was replaced by Griffins own composition , Changing Keys , to allow him to derive royalties from that compositions use on both the network and syndicated versions . Steve Kaplan became music director starting with the premiere of the 15th syndicated season in 1997 , and continued to serve as such until he was killed when the Cessna 421C Golden Eagle he was piloting crashed into a home in Claremont , California , in December 2003 . His initial theme was a remix of Changing Keys , but by the 18th syndicated season ( 2000\u201301 ) , he had replaced it with a composition of his own , which was titled Happy Wheels . Since 2006 , music direction has been handled by Frankie Blue and John Hoke . Themes they have written for the show include a remix of Happy Wheels and an original rock-based composition .",
      "In addition to Changing Keys , Griffin also composed various incidental music cues for the syndicated version which were used for announcements of prizes in the shows early years . Among them were Frisco Disco ( earlier the closing theme for a revival of Jeopardy ! which aired in 1978 and 1979 ) , A Time for Tony ( whose basic melody evolved into Think! , the longtime theme song for Jeopardy! ) , Buzzword ( later used as the theme for Merv Griffins Crosswords ) , Nightwalk , Struttin on Sunset , and an untitled vacation cue .",
      "Audition process .",
      "Anyone at least 18 years old has the potential to become a contestant through Wheel of Fortunes audition process . Exceptions include employees and immediate family members of ViacomCBS , Sony Pictures Entertainment , or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries ; any firm involved in supplying prizes for the show ; and television stations that broadcast Wheel and/or Jeopardy! , their sister radio stations , and those advertising agencies that are affiliated with them . Also ineligible to apply as contestants are individuals who have appeared on a different game show within the previous year , three other game shows within the past ten years , or on any version of Wheel of Fortune itself .",
      "Throughout the year , the show uses a custom-designed Winnebago recreational vehicle called the Wheelmobile to travel across the United States , holding open auditions at various public venues . Participants are provided with entry forms which are then drawn randomly . Individuals whose names are drawn appear on stage , five at a time , and are interviewed by traveling host Marty Lublin . The group of five then plays a mock version of the speed-up round , and five more names are selected after a puzzle is solved . Everyone who is called onstage receives a themed prize , usually determined by the spin of a miniature wheel . Auditions typically last two days , with three one-hour segments per day . After each Wheelmobile event , the most promising candidates are invited back to the city in which the first audition was held , to participate in a second audition . Alternatively , a participant may submit an audition form with a self-shot video through the shows website to enter an audition . Contestants not appearing on stage at Wheelmobile events have their applications retained and get drawn at random to fill second-level audition vacancies . At the second audition , potential contestants play more mock games featuring a miniature wheel and puzzle board , followed by a 16-puzzle test with some letters revealed . The contestants have five minutes to solve as many puzzles as they can by writing in the correct letters . The people who pass continue the audition , playing more mock games which are followed by interviews .",
      "Broadcast history .",
      "Wheel of Fortune premiered on January 6 , 1975 , at 10:30 am ( 9:30 Central ) on NBC . Lin Bolen , then the head of daytime programming , purchased the show from Griffin to compensate him for canceling the original Jeopardy ! series , which had one year remaining on its contract . Jeopardy ! aired its final episode on the Friday before Wheels premiere . The original Wheel aired on NBC , in varying time slots between 10:30 am and noon , until June 30 , 1989 . Throughout that versions run , episodes were generally 30 minutes in length , except for six weeks of shows aired between December 1975 and January 1976 which were 60 minutes in length . NBC announced the cancellation of the show in August 1980 , but it stayed on the air following a decision to cut the duration of The David Letterman Show from 90 to 60 minutes . The network Wheel moved to CBS on July 17 , 1989 , and remained there until January 14 , 1991 . After that , it briefly returned to NBC , replacing Lets Make a Deal , but was canceled permanently on September 20 of that year .",
      "The daily syndicated nighttime version of Wheel premiered on September 19 , 1983 . From its debut , the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart . The show came from humble beginnings : King World chairmen Roger , Michael , and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show , and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York , Los Angeles , or Chicago , Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days . Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning , but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it , and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households . Soon , Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show , and at the beginning of the 1984\u201385 season , Griffin followed up on the shows success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy! , hosted by Alex Trebek . The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy ! siphoned ratings from the periods three longest-running and most popular game shows , Tic-Tac-Dough , The Jokers Wild , and Family Feud , to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986 . At this point , Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history , and at the peak of the shows popularity , over 40 million people were watching five nights per week . The series , along with companion series Jeopardy! , remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011 . The program has become Americas longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication , second to the version of The Price Is Right which began airing in 1972 . In 1992 , the show began airing on most of the owned-and-operated stations for ABC , currently known as the ABC Owned Television Stations . The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans , and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants .",
      "The popularity of Wheel of Fortune has led it to become a worldwide franchise , with over forty known adaptations in international markets outside the United States . Versions of the show have existed in such countries as Australia , , Denmark , France , , Italy , Malaysia , New Zealand , the Philippines , Poland , Russia , Spain , the United Kingdom , and . The American version of Wheel has honored its international variants with an occasional theme of special weeks known as Wheel Around the World , the inaugural episode of which aired when the 23rd syndicated season premiered on September 12 , 2005 .",
      "Between September 1997 and January 1998 , CBS and Game Show Network concurrently aired a special childrens version of the show titled Wheel 2000 . It was hosted by David Sidoni , with Tanika Ray providing voice and motion capture for a CGI hostess named Cyber Lucy . Created by Scott Sternberg , the spin-off featured special gameplay in which numerous rules were changed . For example , the shows child contestants competed for points and prizes instead of cash , with the eventual winner playing for a grand prize in the bonus round .",
      "In November 2020 , ABC ordered a prime time spin-off show , Celebrity Wheel of Fortune , with Richards as executive producer and Sajak and White as hosts , which premiered on January 7 , 2021 . Each hour-long episode consists of two complete games , with the same three celebrities playing on behalf of designated charities in both . In May 2021 , ABC renewed Celebrity Wheel of Fortune for a second season .",
      "Reception .",
      "Wheel of Fortune has long been one of the highest-rated programs on U.S . syndicated television . It was the highest-rated show in all of syndication before it was dethroned by Two and a Half Men in the 28th season ( 2010\u201311 ) . The syndicated Wheel shared the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show with Jeopardy ! in 2011 , and Sajak won three Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Game Show Host\u2014in 1993 , 1997 , and 1998 .

In August 2006 , the show was ranked number 6 on GSNs list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows .",
      "Wheel was the subject of many nominations in GSNs Game Show Awards special , which aired on June 6 , 2009 . The show was nominated for Best Game Show , but lost to Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? ; Sajak and White were nominated for Best Game Show Host , but lost to Deal or No Deals Howie Mandel ; and ODonnell was considered for Best Announcer but lost to Rich Fields from The Price Is Right . One of the catchphrases uttered by contestants , Id like to buy a vowel , was considered for Favorite Game Show Catch Phrase , but lost to Come on down! , the announcers catchphrase welcoming new contestants to Price . The sound effect heard at the start of a new regular gameplay round won the award for Favorite Game Show Sound Effect . The sound heard when the wheel lands on Bankrupt was also nominated . Despite having been retired from the show for nearly a decade by that point , Changing Keys was nominated for Best Game Show Theme Song . However , it lost to its fellow Griffin composition , Think ! from Jeopardy !",
      "A hall of fame honoring Wheel of Fortune is part of the Sony Pictures Studios tour , and was introduced on the episode aired May 10 , 2010 . Located in the same stage as the shows taping facility , this hall of fame features memorabilia related to Wheels syndicated history , including retired props , classic merchandise , photographs , videos , and a special case dedicated to Whites wardrobe . Two years later , in 2012 , the show was honored with a Ride of Fame on a double-decker tour bus in New York City .",
      "Merchandise .",
      "Numerous board games based on Wheel of Fortune have been released by different toy companies . The games are all similar , incorporating a wheel , puzzle display board , play money and various accessories like Free Spin tokens . Milton Bradley released the first board game in 1975 . In addition to all the supplies mentioned above , the game included 20 prize cards to simulate the shopping prizes of the show , with prizes ranging in value from $100 to $3,000 . Two editions were released , with the only differences being the box art and the included books of puzzles . Other home versions were released by Pressman Toy Corporation , Tyco/Mattel , Parker Brothers , Endless Games , and Irwin Toys .",
      "Additionally , several video games based on the show have been released for personal computers , the Internet , and various gaming consoles spanning multiple hardware generations .

      "Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi ( literally The Football Club of Helsinki ) , commonly known as HJK Helsinki , or simply as HJK , is a professional football club based in Helsinki , Finland . The club competes in the Finnish Veikkausliiga . Founded in 1907 , the club has spent most of its history in the top tier of Finnish football . The clubs home ground is the 10,770-seat Bolt Arena , where they have played since 2000 .",
      "Generally considered as Finlands biggest club , HJK is the most successful Finnish club in terms of championship titles with 30 . The club has also won 14 Finnish Cups and 5 Finnish League Cups . Many of Finlands most successful players have played for HJK before moving abroad . The club has also similar success with womens Kansallinen Liiga .",
      "HJK is the only Finnish club that has participated in the UEFA Champions League group stage . In 1998 , they beat Metz in the play-off round to clinch their place in the competition for the following season . HJK has also participated in the UEFA Europa League , in 2014\u201315 , defeating Rapid Wien in the play-off round . The clubs highest score in a European competition came during the 2011\u201312 season , with a 13\u20130 aggregate victory over Welsh champions Bangor City , which included a 10\u20130 home win .",
      "HJKs traditional kit colours have long been blue and white striped shirts with blue shorts and socks . The clubs crest has been nearly untouched for a century , it has only undergone one minor font change in order to modernize it .",
      "History .",
      "The club was founded as Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi \u2013 Helsingfors Fotbollsklubb in 1907 by Fredrik Wath\u00e9n . The founding meeting was held at a bowling alley in Kaisaniemi Park in May . The first ever competitive fixture was played against Eken\u00e4s IF in Eken\u00e4s . HJK won 2\u20134 .",
      "Early on , HJK became popular amongst Finnish-speaking students , while Swedish-speaking students preferred to play mainly for Unitas or HIFK . In late 1908 , after a heated debate , the language was switched to unilingually Finnish and this resulted in many Swedish-speaking members switching over to HIFK and other clubs , although a few chose to stay .",
      "In 1909 , the colours blue and white were chosen to support the fennoman movement and bandy was introduced as the clubs second official sport . The club moved from Kaisaniemi Ground to the new El\u00e4intarha Stadium . At the end of the year , Fredrik Wathen was forced to leave his post as the clubs chairman due to illness .",
      "In 1910 , Lauri Tanner became the longest-running club chairman to date . The same year , the clubs first international match was played , against Eriksdals IF from Stockholm in Kaisaniemi . The first championship title was won in 1911 . In 1915 , the club moved to newly build T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6n Pallokentt\u00e4 . In 1916 , tennis was introduced as the third official sport in HJK , and it was played in the club until the early 1920s . During the Finnish Civil War in 1918 , two HJK club members , fighting for the Whites , were killed .",
      "In 1921 , the first bandy championship was won and during the following five seasons , HJK reached five finals , winning three more titles . Bowling was added to the clubs repertoire in 1925 , but the bowlers formed their own club , Helsingin Keilaajat , the following year . In 1928 , ice hockey became an official sport and the first championship was won in 1929 . League format was introduced to Finnish football in 1930 but HJK failed to qualify for the first season . In 1931 , HJK played their first season in the league , however at the end of the season , they were relegated .",
      "During World War II , HJK lost 22 members serving in the military , of which nine fell in the Winter War , twelve in the Continuation War and one in the Lapland War . In 1943 , handball was introduced as the clubs sixth official sport . HJK won one silver and two bronze medals in handball during the following three seasons but did not gain further success . Handball was first of HJKs sports where women also competed . The womens team played a total of 22 seasons at the highest level ; their highest finish was fourth .",
      "In 1963 , HJK played their last ever season in the second level of the football pyramid , winning 20 out of 22 matches and scoring 127 goals . In 1964 , the newly promoted club won their tenth championship title and the following season , in 1965\u201366 , they played their first European Cup match , against Manchester United at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium . However , a 2\u20139 aggregate loss resulted in HJKs elimination from the competition .",
      "In 1966 , the club secured their first ever cup title by winning KTP 6\u20131 in the final in front of 7,000 spectators . Bandy section was disbanded in the late 1960s . The last official sport , figure skating , was added into the clubs repertoire in 1966 , was abolished in 1972 . The ice hockey section was also disbanded in 1972 and the last season in handball was played in 1978 . Hereafter , HJK therefore only participated in football following 69 years as a multisport club .",
      "The 1998\u201399 season saw HJK become the first and , to date , only Finnish club to play in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League after defeating Metz in the second qualifying round . The club also managed a respectable five points in their group , defeating Benfica at home and earning draws at home to 1 . FC Kaiserslautern and away to Benfica . They lost to PSV twice and to Kaiserslautern away .",
      "The clubs current home stadium , the Telia 5G -areena , was opened in 2000 . The 20th championship title was won in 2002 and in 2008 , the club won its tenth Finnish Cup title . The 2009 season was the start of a championship run that resulted in six titles in a row from 2009 to 2014 .",
      "In 2014 , HJK became the first Finnish club to play in the UEFA Europa League group stage after defeating Rapid Wien in the play-off round . HJK , with wins over Torino and Copenhagen at home , finished third in their group with six points .",
      "HJK made several acquisitions during the winter of 2015 , including C\u00f3rdoba forward Mike Havenaar , J-league playmaker Atomu Tanaka and Birmingham City holding midfielder Guy Moussi . With the new signings on their side , HJK began the season on a high by winning the league cup , a feat they had not accomplished since 1998 . HJK also played its first local derby against HIFK since April 1972 , drawing 1\u20131 . However , HJK could not replicate the league success they had enjoyed for the last six seasons , finishing the 2015 season in third place , behind champions SJK and runners-up RoPS .",
      "During the 2017 campaign the club lost only three games , which resulted in a domestic double .",
      "Crest and colours .",
      "Badge .",
      "In 1910 HJK arranged competition to find a crest for club but club board wasnt happy with proposals . Crest was finally designed by Osmo Korvenkontio in 1913 , it has only gone through minor changes during history .",
      "Colours .",
      "First kit of HJK was plain white shirt , black shorts and black socks with few white horizontal stripes on top . In 1909 HJK introduced its trademark blue and white striped shirt . Blue and white colours were homage to fennoman movement . Black trunks still remained for decades . Shirt was changed to unicolour blue for season 1973 due to pressure from sponsors . In attempt to professionalize hockey department club had fallen in to financial despair and sponsors demanded more visibility for their adds . Clubs financial situation had improved by 1986 and due fans demands shirt was changed back to striped by the end of the year and has remained so ever since .",

      "Supporters and rivalries .",
      "Historically HJK had a wide support within Finnish speaking , prosperous middle class of Helsinki . The clubs supporters were often nationalistic after the fashion of almost every other Finnish FA club at the time . Leftist working class clubs played their own leagues and competitions under the Finnish Workers Sports Federation . However , The club remained open to all honorable citizens regardless of their native language , race or social class , and always had members from other communities as well . Before the 1970s HJK came to be known especially as a T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6an club due to most of their activity taking place in this particular district .",
      "During recent decades the clubs old image as a prosperous , middle class group from T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 has largely disappeared due to social changes in Finland as well as migration from inner city to housing projects built during the mass migration from the countryside during the 1960s and the 1970s .",
      "The Helsinki Derby and other local rivalries .",
      "HJKs main rivals in Helsinki were widely considered to be Kiffen , HPS and HIFK . In the past these were the four big clubs from Helsinki . The clubs were mainly separated by language , HJK and HPS being Finnish speaking clubs whereas HIFK and KIF were Swedish speaking . These four clubs competed also in bandy , ice hockey and handball . The support for HJK mainly came from around the inner city and after 1940s also from T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 , in its early years HPS Support came from same areas as HJK . Later in 1940s and 1950s when HJK support shifted more towards T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 area , HPS gained more support in Vallila and Alppila districts , this was mostly due their youth activities taking part in those particular areas , these boundaries were not strict however and each of the four clubs had support , players and members across the city . HJK were already founding youth teams to new suburbs in 1960s and their reputation as a T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6an club was short lived . KIF and HPS were both struggling to survive and were both relegated to lower leagues after 1964 season and rapidly lost their support . KIF made a brief two season stint to first level in 1977\u201378 . While both KIF and HPS are still active as of 2020 , they have spend their recent decades playing in lower levels , HPS focusing more on youth football in northern Helsinki .",
      "HJK and HIFK share the biggest rivalry being two of the oldest and most successful clubs . Both were also successful in Bandy which was major winter sport in the first half of the 20th century , KIF and HPS gained lesser success . Also in Ice Hockey clubs faced numerous times and played more seasons in first level than HPS or KIF . A match between these two clubs is called as Stadin derby . Language was the biggest separating factor between the clubs , HIFK was the club of choice for the Swedish speaking population of the city and HJK for the Finnish speaking . In 2015 HIFK was promoted back to the top flight after 40 years of struggling in the lower leagues having played their last season in the top division in 1972 . Since HJK ceased their activity in other sports during the 1960s and 1970s the rivalry faded away on a large scale and in recent decades many even supported both clubs at the same time , HJK in football and HIFK in ice hockey . However , due to the rise of the Finnish supporter scene in the 2000s , there is a high tension between the most vocal supporters .",
      "HJK shared a short but fierce rivalry with FC Jokerit around the late 1990s and the early 2000s . Jokerit were well supported due to their popular ice hockey section and the clubs also competed against each other in ice hockey in the late 1960s and the early 1970s .",
      "Multiple Helsinki based clubs have played in the league but due to their short term visits and relatively low support base large scale rivalries were never born . Some notable clubs were Ponnistus , FinnPa , Pallo-Pojat and Helsingin Toverit .",
      "Helsinki-Lahti rivalry .",
      "HJK has competed against Lahti based clubs from the 1960s , between 1964 and 1980 HJK and Lahden Reipas had a minor rivalry as both clubs gained good success winning some titles and were also generally well supported . Reipas also won seven cup titles against one of HJK . Reipas was relegated after 1980 season . More notable rivalry was against Kuusysi from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s . Between 1981 and 1992 HJK won six league titles against Kuusysis five , both clubs also won the cup twice , facing two times in the finals ( which were both won by HJK ) . Both clubs also performed well in the European competitions . In 1996 both the Lahti clubs merged and FC Lahti was born , HJK and FC Lahti matches are more known from outside pitch activities , some crowd disturbances and small fights have occurred which otherwise are rare in Finnish football . Due to a relatively short distance between the two cities , these matches often draw more notable away support than others .",
      "HJK-Haka rivalry .",
      "HJK and Valkeakosken Haka are the two most successful clubs in Finnish football , HJK with 27 league and 12 cup titles and Haka with 9 league and 12 cup titles . The match is also considered as urban vs . rural rivalry as HJK is a club from Finlands biggest city Helsinki and Haka is representing the small town of Valkeakoski .",

      "Walt Disneys Comics and Stories",
      "Walt Disneys Comics and Stories , sometimes abbreviated WDC&S , is an American anthology comic book series featuring characters from The Walt Disney Companys films and shorts , including Donald Duck , Scrooge McDuck , Mickey Mouse , Chip n Dale , Lil Bad Wolf , Scamp , Bucky Bug , Grandma Duck , Brer Rabbit , Winnie the Pooh , and others . With more than 700 issues , Walt Disneys Comics & Stories is the longest-running Disney comic book in the United States , making it the flagship title , and is one of the best-selling comic books of all time .",
      "The book was originally published by Dell Comics ( 1940-1962 ) , and there have been many revivals over the years , continuing the same legacy numbering . The revivals have been published by Gold Key Comics ( 1962\u20131984 ) , Gladstone Publishing ( 1986\u20131990 ) , Disney Comics ( 1990\u20131993 ) , back to Gladstone Publishing ( 1993\u20131999 ) , Gemstone Publishing ( 2003-2008 ) , Boom ! Studios ( 2009-2011 ) and IDW Publishing ( 2015\u2013present ) .",
      "Publication history .",
      "The precursor to WDC&S was Mickey Mouse Magazine , published in several incarnations from 1933 to 1940 . WDC&S itself was launched by Dell in October 1940 , and initially consisted of reprints taken from the Disney comic strips Donald Duck , Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphony reformatted for comic books and colored . The first original story created for WDC&S was The Flying Gauchito illustrated by Walt Kelly in #24 ( Aug . 1942 ) ; the story adapted a cartoon short included in The Three Caballeros , released in 1944 .",
      "The comics anthology format usually began with a 10-page story featuring Donald Duck and for most of the run ended with a serial or single story featuring Mickey Mouse . The most popular issues featured the Donald Duck ten-pagers written and drawn by Carl Barks , who began the run with issue # 31 ( April 1943 ) . Barks stopped producing original stories after issue #312 ( September 1966 ) , but his stories have been continually reprinted up to the present . Almost all of these stories co-starred Donalds nephews , Huey , Dewey and Louie , with frequent guest appearances by Barks creation Uncle Scrooge , as well as the Beagle Boys , Gyro Gearloose , and Gladstone Gander .",
      "Bucky Bug stories began in issue #20 ( May 1942 ) with a series of newspaper reprints from the Silly Symphony comic strip ; original Bucky stories started later , in issue #39 ( December 1943 ) . Bucky stories were monthly through 1950 ; were not seen for several decades , then returned on an occasional basis from 1988 to the present , with a mixture of old and new material .",
      "Lil Bad Wolf stories began in issue #52 ( January 1945 ) and remained a regular feature for more than ten years , continuing to appear in the majority of issues even after the continuous run stopped . Carl Buettner ( 1945\u20131946 ) , Gil Turner ( 1948\u20131956 ) , and Dick Matena ( 2005\u20132008 ) are generally regarded as the most notable Wolf creators featured in the title . More recently ( 2003\u2013present ) , Big Bad Wolf has often supplanted his son as title character of the stories .",
      "Many 1940s issues featured Mickey Mouse serials by Floyd Gottfredson which were reprinted from the Mickey Mouse daily newspaper comic strips . Later , Paul Murry took over drawing original Mickey Mouse serials , with stories written by Carl Fallberg and Don Christensen among others . The 1980s saw numerous Murry reprints ; the 1990s and more recent times have seen new Mickey Mouse stories written by Noel Van Horn and drawn by Cesar Ferioli , as well as some Gottfredson serials not previously anthologized in comic book format .",
      "By the mid-1950s the title was the best selling comic book in the United States , with a monthly circulation of over three million . Mark Evanier describes the high circulation as the product of an aggressive subscription push . Various premiums were offered for new subscribers , including a mini-poster attributed to Walt Kelly advertised on the back cover of WDC&S #100 from January 1949 .",
      "In many 1980s issues , as well as scattered issues from 2006 onward , new Daan Jippes and/or Freddy Milton Donald Duck stories lead off the title . Issues #523 , 524 , 526 , 528 , 531 , and 547 ( all 1987\u20131990 ) featured lead-off stories drawn ( and usually written ) by Don Rosa , while most issues from 1993\u20132005 featured lead-offs by William Van Horn .",
      "Walt Kelly of Pogo fame did the cover art for many issues between #34 and #118 and provided interior art for issues # 34\u201341 and 43 .",
      "Walt Disneys Comics and Stories has been the longest running Disney-based comic book in history , making it their flagship title . After reaching its 600th issue , it converted to prestige format and remained that way until the end of Gemstone Publishings run at issue #698 .",
      "Boom Studios published the title from 2009 until 2011 ( issues #699 to #720 ) .",
      "IDW Publishing began publishing the comic in July 2015 , continuing the number sequence from #721 .",
      "IDWs last issue of Walt Disneys Comics and Stories was #743 , published in September 2018 . At that point , IDW renamed the title to Disney Comics and Stories , restarting the numbering from #1 , but also keeping the legacy numbering ( #744 ) , which appears in the indicia in the contents page . Some of the titles run has been collected in the Timeless Tales collection . IDW has been publishing the new title on an approximately bimonthly schedule , with #7 coming out in September 2019 .",
      "Numbering .",
      "While the issues are now referred to with sequential numbers , the format for the first ten years of the comic was to use the volume and number . For example , issue #100 ( Jan 1949 ) was labeled Vol . 9 No . 4 . The title started using whole numbers with issue #124 , in January 1951 .",

      "The construction of the new werk was started in 1300 . It was completed after ten years in 1310 . The style of a keep matches the common Norman tower type of the time . Contrary to some literature , the tower was built in this form from the beginning . The fire in the 1360s destroyed most of the wooden elements and it had to undergo major reconstruction .",
      "The original roof was made of lead , and was replaced by copper in 1474 . This was again replaced in 1558 by a tiled roof and by a new copper roof following that . The copper was then used for military purposes in 1916 reconstructed later .",
      "The original purpose was to host troops to defend the ships entering and leaving the Elbe from sea and beach pirates . The tower was also refuge for the farmers on the island during storm surges and survivors of shipwrecks over the centuries .",
      "The tower marked the most northern measuring point for the triangulation of the Kingdom of Hannover by Carl Friedrich Gauss in July 1825 . Parts of this triangulation net were depicted on the back of last series of the 10 Deutsche Mark note ( 1989\u20132001 ) .",
      "The tower of Neuwerk is officially Hamburgs oldest building . A church in Sinstorf is actually older , but only part of Hamburg since the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937 .",
      "The tower is protected under cultural heritage management since 1924 and the surrounding dwelling hill since 1971 . It is used as viewpoint , guesthouse and restaurant .",
      "Lighthouse .",
      "Before the tower was turned into a lighthouse in 1814 , the dangerous reef and sandbank of Scharh\u00f6rn was marked by multiple beacons and bearing aids , most importantly the Scharh\u00f6rnbake . The most important was the bearing of wooden beacons north-west end of Neuwerk and its tower to find the smaller beacon in the open sea . Todays Nord-Bake still shows the form of a beacon to overshadow an open fire once the ships reached this bearing .",
      "The Carta Marina shows a fire beacon on Nuge uirk as early as 1539 , but other sources mention the open coal fire beacon not until 1644 : It was a navigational aid during night time . This required 1000 tons of imported Scottish coal a year starting from 1761 . This coal contained more bitumen and burned much brighter than the usual German hard coal .",
      "The tower was only turned into a lighthouse on December 20 , 1814 . The first lamp was made of 21 hollow wick oil lamps with parabolic reflectors and burned on colza oil and kerosene starting 1870 . A fresnel lens of measuring a focal length of 700 mm was installed 1892 together with a five-wick kerosene lamp , to improve the brightness even further . This lens is still used today . The lamp was again improved in 1908 , to be first electrified in 1942 . Electricity was needed to shut down the light quickly during World War II . The kerosene lamp were kept in place as there was no emergency power supply and upgraded to propane in 1949 . The luminous intensity was stated in 1952 to be 5700 Hefner lamps ( HK ) 13200 seaside , 1000 for the green and 550 for the red light . The reach of the 1000 watt lamp was roughly 30 kilometers . Is could be seen from Heligoland under good conditions . The classic electric lamp was replaced by a Halogen lamp in fall 2007 . On February 10 , 2014 it was replaced by LED .",
      "Although belonging to Hamburg , the lighthouse was operated by the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt Cuxhaven , which is responsible for the Elbe estuary . As the lighthouse was non-essential for shipping it was decommissioned on January 1 , 2014 and turned over to the Hamburg Port Authority . On February 10 , 2014 it was officially shut down after almost 200 years in operation and continues as a private light under the authority of Hamburg.The original light characteristic Blk . ( 3 ) w . r . gn . 20 s 16\u201311 sm was switched to a steady white lamp with a reach of barely 3 nautical miles .",
      "The original open coal beacon was replaced by the small lighthouse after the great lighthouse started operating and functioned together with him as leading lights . This allowed for safe passage from north-west over the Vogelsandsteert . The forementioned open fire beacon , the great and small lighthouses and todays Nord-Bake all were established on the same bearing . The small lighthouse was torn down in 1909 .",
      "Usage .",
      "Apart from the floors for the guesthouse for the Hamburg state guests , the tower is home to the warden , a restaurant and their personnel . The former teacher Heinrich Gechter initiated the use as a hostel for schools of Winterhude in 1920 , which switched to the neighboring barn 1924 . The attic was also home the bird warden from the Verein Jordsand for many years .",
      "In the 1600s Royal Protestant Imperial Count Palatine Johann Rist resided at Neuwerk ."

      "Engels ( ) , formerly known as Pokrovsk and Kosakenstadt , is a city in Saratov Oblast , Russia . It is a port located on the Volga River across from Saratov , the administrative center of the oblast , and is connected to it with a bridge . It is the second-largest city in Saratov Oblast with a population of . Historically an important center for Volga Germans , the city was known jointly as Pokrovsk in Russian and as Kosakenstadt in German , until it was renamed after Friedrich Engels in 1931 .

It was granted official town status and renamed Pokrovsk ( ) in 1914. . At that time , the town was commonly known as Kosakenstadt ( Cossacks Town ) in German , alongside its official Russian name . During the Russian Civil War the region came under control of the communist Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic , and in 1918 it became the capital of the newly established Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the RSFSR . Pokrovsk/Kosakenstadt was renamed Engels in 1931 , in honour of German communist philosopher Friedrich Engels ; however , it was already labelled as such in 1920 on Stanfords General Map of the World . The Volga German ASSR was disestablished in 1941 following the German invasion of the Soviet Union , and the city became part of Saratov Oblast . Its German inhabitants suffered persecution as Soviet authorities feared they could be spies for Nazi Germany . All Germans were expelled from Engels , with most being sent to far away in Siberia and the Kazakh SSR . On August 26 , 2011 , a monument in honor of the Russian-German victims of repression within the Soviet Union was unveiled in the city .",

      "History .",
      "In Sweden , the Master-General of the Ordnance ( Generalf\u00e4lttygm\u00e4stare ) was an appointment for a member of the Krigskollegium ( Board of Warfare ) from 1675 and the head of the Artillery Office ( Artillerikontoret ) from 1682 to 1794 and from 1807 to 1897 . The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for the central administration of the artillery , the procurement and care of the armys weapons and ammunition , and for the land defence ( lantf\u00f6rsvaret ) stock supplies , the so-called Ordnance Storage ( Tygf\u00f6rr\u00e5det ) . Earlier , he was called Riksf\u00e4lttygsm\u00e4stare . Between 1782 and 1865 , the Master-General of the Ordnance was the head of the Ordnance Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration , with , among others , the Deputy Chief of Ordnance and two Tygm\u00e4stare ( Master of the Ordnance ) of regimental officers or captains rank , as subordinates .",
      "The Master-General of the Ordnance was head of the artillery until 1898 . That year a change was carried out through which the artillery regiments and corps were placed under the command of the commander of each army division , while the Master-General of the Ordnance retained the command over the Artillery Staff and the artillery workshops and ordnance staff . However , he still had the obligation to inspect the artillerys exercises , and his complete title was therefore the Master-General of the Ordnance and Inspector of Artillery . He also served as head of the Artillery Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration . As Inspector , he was responsible for the artillery in the same way as the Inspectors of the Infantry and the Cavalry , and also commanded and supervised the Swedish Army Artillery School ( Artilleriets skjutskola , ArtSS ) .",
      "As Master-General of the Ordnance , it was imperative for him to pay constant attention to the improvement of firearms with associated ammunition and equipment , and for that purpose at the Kings request to employ or attempt to arrange for them . Furthermore , he would submit to the King for review and establishing proposals for new or changed weapon designs and more . Finally , he would oversee operations at artillery factories and ordnance establishments and oversee manufacturing of weapons , ammunition and artillery equipment for the needs of the army . To his assistant , the Master-General of the Ordnance and the Inspector of Artillery in the latter capacity had at his disposal certain personnel from the Artillery Staff . This personnel , which together formed the Artillery Inspectorate ( Artilleriinspektionen ) , was made up partly of the head of the Artillery Staff , who also served as commander of the Swedish Army Artillery School , and partly of the chief of staff of the Artillery Inspectorate , a major of the Artillery Staff , with the subordinate Equipment Department and the Inspectors Office Department . The personnel in the departments consisted of Artillery Staff officers and commissioned officers .",
      "In 1936 , the Master-General of the Ordnances role as Inspector of Artillery ceased and in 1937 he became the head of the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps . In 1968 the post was eliminated .",

      "Major General Comte Albert-Marie Edmond Gu\u00e9risse GC , KBE , DSO ( 5 April 1911 \u2013 26 March 1989 ) was a Belgian Resistance member who organized French and Belgium escape routes for downed Allied pilots during World War II under the alias of Patrick Albert Pat OLeary , the name of a Canadian friend . His escape line was dubbed the Pat OLeary Line .",
      "Biography .",
      "Gu\u00e9risse was born in Brussels , and qualified in medicine at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles before joining the Belgian Army . Gu\u00e9risse was M\u00e9decin-Capitaine with a Belgian cavalry regiment during their eighteen-day campaign in May 1940 . He managed to escape to England through Dunkirk . At Gibraltar , he joined the crew of a former French merchant ship , Rhin , which had been renamed to serve in the Mediterranean on clandestine missions . He secured entry into the British Royal Navy and was commissioned as Lieutenant Commander Patrick Albert OLeary RNVR of French-Canadian origin . The Canadian identity attempted to explain his not-quite British accent in English , and his not-quite French accent in French , in order to protect his family in occupied Belgium if he was captured . He had a six-week undercover training session with Naval Intelligence . Until April 1941 , he was serving mainly as a conducting officer , escorting agents ashore in small boats through the surf , whilst the large vessel lay some distance offshore . This was skilled work , exposed to physical dangers from the sea-conditions and operational dangers from the Vichy security services .",
      "On 25 April 1941 , during a mission to place Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) agents in Collioure , on Roussillon coast in southern France , Gu\u00e9risse and three crewmen from HMS Fidelity were arrested by the Vichy French coast guard and taken to a camp for British military prisoners at Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort near N\u00eemes . Helped by fellow British officers , OLeary escaped in early June 1941 . He went to Marseilles where everyone at the Fort knew there was an escape organisation run by a man named Ian Garrow and soon made contact . At this point his intention was make his way to Gibraltar and resume his original naval service . Events were to dictate otherwise because Garrow wanted OLeary to stay and help with the organisation since he was a military officer , he had undercover training and unlike Garrow , spoke French fluently . Consequently , a request was sent to London that he stay , which was approved and confirmed by a BBC radio message received on 2 July 1941 . Fidelity was lost with all hands when torpedoed in the South Atlantic on 31 December 1942 . OLeary immediately began his job : within a four-month period , he helped about fifty men escape from the prison of St Hippolyte du Fort , then moved them down the line back to England through the Pyrenees .",
      "When the Vichy France authorities captured Garrow in October 1941 , Gu\u00e9risse took over as chief of the escape network . Along with others such as Nancy Wake , he smuggled a German uniform to Garrow in his cell in Mauzac concentration camp , which helped Garrows escape on 6 December 1941 . At this point the British decided it was time for Garrow to return to London , so OLeary continued in command and expanded the reach of the escape lines operations . The line carried over 600 escapees to Spain and back to Britain .",
      "In January 1943 , the escape line was infiltrated and betrayed by French turncoat Roger le Neveu , an associate of Harold Cole ; Gu\u00e9risse was arrested in Toulouse in March . En route to prison he managed to get one of the younger members , Fabien de Cortes , to escape and warn the British . After his arrest the line was taken over by Marie Dissard . Gu\u00e9risse told nothing to the Gestapo interrogators when he was tortured and then was sent to a series of concentration camps , including Mauthausen . No one , neither in the network , nor the French police nor the Gestapo , ever knew OLearys true identity .",
      "In the summer of 1944 , he was at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in Alsace with another SOE agent , Brian Stonehouse . At the camp he witnessed the arrival of four other female SOE agents , Andr\u00e9e Borrel , Vera Leigh , Diana Rowden , and Sonya Olschanezky , who were all executed and disposed of in the crematorium in an attempt to make them disappear without a trace , under the programme of Night and Fog . After the war , Gu\u00e9risse and Stonehouse were able to testify at the Nazi war crimes trials as to the womens fate .",
      "Finally , Gu\u00e9risse was taken to the Dachau concentration camp , tortured again and then sentenced to death . However , when SS guards surrendered before the Allied advance , OLeary took command and refused to leave until the Allies agreed to take care of the inmates . On 30 April 1945 , he was chosen as the first president of the International Prisoners Committee that administered the camp after liberation .",
      "From its founding in 1956 until his death he served many terms as president of the Comit\u00e9 International de Dachau , and regularly gave the keynote speech at the May memorial ceremonies .",
      "In 1946 , he was appointed a member of the War Crime Commission at Nuremberg . In November 1946 he was demobilized from the Royal Navy and resumed his real name and rejoined the Belgian army , returning to his former regiment . In 1951 , he volunteered as a medical officer for the Belgian United Nations Corps in Korea during the Korean War where he was wounded while going to rescue a wounded soldier under enemy fire . He became the head of the medical service of the Belgian Army and retired in 1970 , in the rank of major general .",
      "Personal life .",
      "In his personal life , he married Sylvia Cooper-Smith in 1947 ; they had a son , Patrick . Sylvia Gu\u00e9risse predeceased her husband .",
      "He was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre .",
      "Awards and decorations .",
      "General Gu\u00e9risse received 37 decorations , from a variety of nations . In 1946 , the British recognised his war service with the award of the George Cross . This was the highest possible award of the British Commonwealth nations for actions not in combat and only the Victoria Cross ( the equivalent award for bravery in actual combat ) takes precedence .",
      "In the UK it is the convention for the post-nominal letters for both these awards to be appended to the surname even for general usage , i.e . to refer to : Gu\u00e9risse , GC . Recognising his military service as a whole , the British later also conferred on Albert-Marie Gu\u00e9risse , GC , an honorary knighthood ( KBE ) .",
      "Similarly , the King of Belgium recognised the lifetime service of General Gu\u00e9risse with the grant of a peerage in 1986 , in the rank of Count ( comte ) . His motto : Honores non-quaero , fidelis sum ( Honors I do not seek , faithful I am ) .",
      "Death .",
      "General Count Albert-Marie Gu\u00e9risse died in Waterloo , Belgium on 26 March 1989 , aged 77 .",

      "Athletic Club Omonoia Nicosia ( , \u0391\u03a3\u039f\u039b ; Athlitikos Sillogos Omonoias Lefkosias , ASOL ; Omonia is Greek for amity ) is a Cypriot professional football club based in Nicosia . The club was established on 4 June 1948 . The football team of AC Omonia joined the Cyprus Football Association in 1953 . On 14 June 2018 the football team of AC Omonoia became a professional for-profit football company .",
      "Omonoia is the most popular and the most historically successful football clubs in Cyprus , having won 21 national championships , 14 cups and 16 super cups . Omonia holds an outstanding record of 14 championships in two decades ( between 1970\u20131989 ) , a record of being either champion or runner-up 14 times in a row in the championship ( between 1973-1986 ) , and the record of having won the Cypriot Cup four times in a row ( between 1980 and 1983 ) .",
      "The AC Omonia also operates basketball , volleyball , cycling and futsal . The latter one is being particularly successful , having won the league and cup in three consecutive years since 2011 .",
      "History .",
      "Creation and early years ( 1948\u20131953 ) .",
      "On 23 May 1948 , the governing board of APOEL football club sent a telegram to the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics ( Greek : \u03a3.\u0395.\u0393.\u0391.\u03a3. ) , with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition . In its telegram , the board stated its wish for what it described as the communist mutiny to be ended . Club players considering this action as a specifically political comment on the Greek Civil War distanced themselves from the board and were duly expelled from APOEL .",
      "On 4 June 1948 , Dr . Mattheos Papapetrou organized a meeting in Nicosia that led to the creation of Omonia . Many players expelled from APOEL were present at the meeting and joined the new club . Along with other left-wing teams such as Nea Salamina , Alki Larnaca and Orfeas Nicosia , Omonia helped create in December 1948 the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation . Omonia took part in the CAFF league until 1953 , having won four out of five played championships and five out of five played cups . Omonia was then accepted by the Cyprus Football Association to participate in the Cypriot First Division",
      "Beginnings in the Cypriot First Division ( 1953\u20131969 ) .",
      "After joining the Cypriot First Division in 1953 , Omonia only placed seventh out of nine teams in the 1953\u201354 season , barely avoiding relegation . During that decade , the clubs best placing came during the 1956\u201357 season when the club finished in the third position .",
      "The team would make its closest push for the title during the 1959\u201360 season after finishing second , one point behind Anorthosis Famagusta . The following year , after seven seasons in the First Division , the club would win its first title in 1960\u201361 season . Omonia , in that season , would score 91 goals in 24 matches on their way to their first ever Cyprus First Division title . Omonia won their second title during the 1965\u201366 season .",
      "Golden era ( 1970s\u20131980s ) .",
      "Omonia won its first trophies of the decade in 1972 , when the club won both the league and the cup . Led by a young Sotiris Kaiafas , Omonia won seven league titles in the 1970s , six of them were consecutive ( 1974\u20131979 ) . At the end of the decade , Omonia had a total of nine championship titles and three cups . At the end of the 1979 season , Omonia trailed its arch-rival APOEL by two championships . In 1976 , Sotiris Kaiafas would go on and win the European Golden Shoe for his single-season 39-goal performance . In 2003 , he was awarded the UEFA Jubilee Awards for the Best Cypriot Footballer of the 20th century .",
      "The 1980s was a successful decade for the club as it won an additional seven Cypriot League Championship titles including another five consecutive in 1981 , 1982 , 1983 , 1984 , 1985 , and in 1987 and in 1989 . As the 1980s came to an end , Omonia had won 14 Cypriot championship titles , becoming the most successful team on the island at the time .",
      "General decline ( 1990s ) .",
      "The 1990s would prove to be less successful than the previous two decades . During this time , Omonia only mustered one Cypriot League title during the 1992\u201393 season . It would be eight years before Omonia would see its next title . In 1997 , Omonia signed the German Rainer Rauffmann , who would later become the second top goalscorer ever for the club . With the help of other Omonia great and then captain , Costas Malekkos , and a young Costas Kaiafas ( the son of Sotiris Kaiafas ) , Rauffmann would become top scorer of the Cypriot First Division in 1997\u201398 , 1998\u201399 , 1999\u201300 and 2000\u201301 seasons and led Omonia to two titles .",
      "Revival ( 2000s ) .",
      "After a disappointing eight seasons , the 2000s decade began with a trophy . Omonia celebrated its 18th Cypriot league championship title in 2001 . Now captained by Costas Kaiafas , Omonia would win its 19th Cypriot League Championship again in 2003 . Since 2003 , however , the team would stumble and be without a title for the next several years . After numerous seasons of poor signings and underachieving , Omonias reigns would be taken over by new chairman and team president , Miltiadis Neophytou in 2008 .",
      "The team would soon be put back on track starting in 2006 , beginning with the signing of Cyprus international goalkeeper Antonis Georgallides . Omonia would continue its star-studded signings by acquiring Cypriot stars that had been playing abroad , such as Elias Charalambous and Stathis Aloneftis . Omonia would then make headlines with the shocking signing of all-time leading scorer for Cyprus , Michalis Konstantinou . In 2009 , Omonia would also sign another Cypriot star , Konstantinos Makrides . En route , Omonia would also acquire young Cypriot hopefuls , 21-year-old Dimitris Christofi and 20-year-old Georgios Efrem . Efrem , who had been playing on the youth team of Arsenal and later Scottish side Rangers , would be the final piece to the puzzle needed to win its 20th Cypriot league championship . After putting the proper pieces in place , Omonia did just that . During the 2009\u201310 season , led by the new captain , Elias Charalambous , Omonia would not lose a single derby , including play-offs matches against either , APOEL , Anorthosis Famagusta nor Apollon .",
      "Head coach Takis Lemonis left the club after disappointing results and Du\u0161an Bajevi\u0107 became the new coach in October 2010 , but was fired in April 2011 . He was replaced by Neophytos Larkou . Omonia would not be able to repeat as Champion during the 2010\u201311 regular season , and instead had to settle with finishing second , despite the addition of yet another young Cypriot rising star , Andreas Avraam . The club , however , was to end on a positive note : under interim coach Neophytos Larkou , Omonia defeated Apollon Limassol in the Cyprus Cup final to win their 13th cup title .",
      "Omonia spent a difficult year but won their 14th cup starring Andr\u00e9 Alves , who scored the winning goal against AEL Limassol . Under the guidance of newly-appointed director of football Nickolas Danskalou , Omonia finished second in the Championship and third after the playoff rounds , all but assuring they would qualify for the second round of the 2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League .",
      "Financial crisis ( 2012\u20132018 ) .",
      "Head coach Neophytos Larkou left the club in September 2012 and Toni Savevski was then appointed as coach . The team began the season with a great win but found its second success after several games . A disappointing first round proved enough to exclude the club from contesting for the championship or the cup . The team managed better results in the second round , finishing the season in third place . Thousands of fans answered the presidents call to donate as much as they could and the financial issues of the club improved . Omonias final match ended in a 3\u20131 victory over AEK Larnaca . Omonia was knocked out in the semi-finals of the cup by AEL Limassol .",
      "In 2013 , Omonia began the new season with Savevski as manager , but he was sacked halfway beside positive results . Miguel \u00c1ngel Lotina was hired as the replacer but was sacked just 37 days later . Kostas Kaiafas , ex-player was then appointed as the new coach . The clubs financial difficulties returned despite the massive fundraiser organized the previous season . Omonia ended fifth in the league , finishing its worst season in 56 years since 1957\u201358 .",
      "In August 2014 , Omonia was knocked out of the Europa League playoff stages by Dynamo Moscow . The club issued a complaint to UEFA regarding the refereeing of the match by Alexandru Tudor . In early September , the club stopped supplying the fans group Gate-9 with tickets resulting in the groups abstention from matches . Two weeks later , after a meeting between the president and the coach , it was decided that tickets were to be supplied again to Gate-9 . Omonia finished fourth in the league . The team was eliminated from the Cypriot Cup semi-finals by APOEL .",
      "The team ended the 2015\u201316 campaign in 4th place . During this season it reached the final of the Cypriot Cup but lost to Apollon Limassol . The 2016\u201317 season saw the club finish 5th . This meant that for the 1st time in 15 years the club would not be able to play in European qualification matches .",
      "Following a general assembly at the end of the season Antonis Tzionis was elected as the new club president .",
      "While the 2017\u201318 campaign began with high expectations Omonia ended the season in 6th place . The season was the worst in the clubs history in terms of defeats and goals conceded . Despite this the club sold a total of 95,222 tickets during the season , more than any other team in the league .",
      "Papastavrou era ( 2018\u2013present ) .",
      "The decline of the clubs football department and the financial difficulties it faced convinced many that a change in the way the club was being run was needed . In May 2018 a general assembly was called and members voted to hand the football department over to Stavros Papastavrou , an American-based Cypriot businessman . Papastavrou plans to invest 5 million euros into the club over the next few years and will invest more over the 20-year period that he will be in charge . He has stated that he will provide funds for the development of the clubs academies and training grounds and that the potential creation of a new stadium will be considered .",
      "The club finished the 2018\u201319 campaign in 6th place and was knocked out of the Cypriot Cup by Apollon Limassol in the second round . Manager Yannis Anastasiou was replaced by Henning Berg in June 2019 .",
      "The 2019\u201320 Cypriot season was abandoned in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . At the time of its abandonment Omonoia was tied with Anorthosis Famagusta on points , but was ranked first due to a better head to head record and thus qualified for the first qualifying round of the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League season . The club would go on to win their 21st league title the following season to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the second successive season .",
      "Name .",
      "Omonia is the Greek word for amity , showing the contrast of the club for discord and disruption .",
      "Colours and badge .",
      "Omonias club colours are green , white and red . Their current alternate kit is red . This is because of the Clubs close association with AKEL , the popular left-wing party of the island . Omonias badge has a green shamrock in a white circle . Green colour symbolises hope and white colour happiness",
      "Stadium .",
      "Since 23 October 1999 , Omonia has been using the 22,859-seat New GSP Stadium , the largest stadium in Cyprus . They share the stadium with local rival APOEL . Omonia played in the Makario Stadium from 1978 until 1999 and in Old GSP Stadium from 1953 to 1978 . When the club was first created , it used the Goal Stadium ( 1948\u20131953 ) .",
      "Supporters .",
      "Omonia supporters are known for their left-leaning , socialist character , expressing Cypriotism with over 80% stating in a survey that they associate themselves with the Progressive Party of Working People.However , its followers recognize their nation which is Greek . They love Cyprus and the Cypriots but they consider that they are Greeks of Cyprus and they are proud of it . In addition , they believe that the Greeks who live in Greece are their brothers and that they are the same since they all have the same mentality , religion and language . Omonia is also traditionally regarded as the club of Cypruss working-class . Many of Omonias supporters can be seen waving banners bearing Che Guevaras image . Gate-9 , the teams ultras group , was established in 1992 . The group occupies the North stand at the GSP stadium during home games . Gate 9 has established relations with other left wing supporters such as those of Hapoel Tel Aviv and Standard Li\u00e8ge .",
      "Omonia holds the record for the most league tickets sold by a Cypriot team in a single season ( 162,061 during the 2009\u201310 campaign ) . The club also holds the Cypriot record for the highest average attendance in a season ( 11,003 during the 2003\u201304 campaign ) .",
      "Financial crisis and 2013 Pan-Cypriot fundraiser .",
      "By the end of February 2013 , Omonia was struggling to meet the UEFA criteria due to the economic crisis that had engulfed the club . The clubs president then decided to start a fundraiser and called for the supporters of the club to donate as much as they could . Hundreds of events were organised island wide with the motto ; \u0395\u0399\u039c\u0391\u0399 \u039f\u039c\u039f\u039d\u039f\u0399\u0391 \u0394\u0397\u039b\u03a9\u039d\u03a9 \u03a0\u0391\u03a1\u03a9\u039d meaning , IM WITH OMONIA , I DECLARE MYSELF PRESENT . Current and former players contributed by signing autographs and selling club merchandise . Although the situation at the beginning was described as grim , money poured in from all over the island and from abroad including England and the United States . In about a month-and-a-half , \u20ac3.5 million was collected from the clubs supporters .",

      "Federal Office for Migration and Refugees",
      "The Bundesamt f\u00fcr Migration und Fl\u00fcchtlinge ( Federal Office for Migration and Refugees , BAMF ) is a German federal agency under the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of the Interior . It is located in the former S\u00fcdkaserne ( South Barracks ) in Nuremberg . It is the central migration authority in Germany and is responsible for registration , integration and repatriation of migrants . It carries out asylum proceedings and decides about asylum applications .",
      "History .",
      "The office was founded on 12 January 1953 as Bundesdienststelle f\u00fcr die Anerkennung ausl\u00e4ndischer Fl\u00fcchtlinge ( Federal Office for the Recognition of Foreign Refugees ) in Langwasser , Nuremberg .",
      "On 18 September 2015 , during the European migrant crisis , Frank-J\u00fcrgen Weise , president of the German employment office Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit ( Federal Agency for Employment ) , was appointed also as chief of BAMF ; since he was not allowed to have a further paid function , he served as a head of the agency without any additional payment . Officially , the vice president of the agency took over the tasks of the office head .",
      "In 2017 BAMF reported that of the 340 000 migrants who participated German language courses during 2016 , less than half at 113 050 received a passing grade . The authority had no idea why .",
      "2000-2018 Bribe scandal .",
      "The BAMF is alleged to have accepted bribes for granting asylum and following these allegations 18,000 asylum approvals since 2000 are to be reviewed . The Bremen office was stripped of its authority to process applications and 13 other offices are being investigated on suspicion of irregularities . Preliminary results of the revision from March 2019 showed , that asylum-proceedings had been violated in 145 cases . Prosecutors assumed at that point , that a single administrator of the BAMF had collaborated with two private lawyers and arranged preferential treatment for the clients they reported to her . Love was cited as the likely motive .",
      "Statistics .",
      "BAMF is in charge of the Central Register of Foreign Nationals ( AZR ) . It is also the national data supplier for the Eurostat in the field of asylum statistics . BAMF publishes data updated on a monthly basis concerning developments in the asylum applications filed in Germany , on the ten countries of origin with the highest number of applicants arriving , as well as on the decisions made concerning the asylum applications , and statistical data on transfer requests that have been filed in the Dublin Procedure .",
      "Structure .",
      "Arrival centres",
      "The arrival centres are the central entry point when it comes to the asylum procedure . It is in the arrival centres that all the steps are carried out under one roof which are necessary for the asylum procedure . This includes the medical examination by the L\u00e4nder , the recording of the personal data and the identity check , the application , the interview and the BAMF decision on the asylum application , as well as the initial advice on access to the labour market by the local Employment Agency .",
      "Branch offices/regional offices",
      "It is in the branch offices that BAMF carries out the asylum procedure , with the filing of the application , the interview and the decision on more complex cases . Some branch offices , known as \u201cregional offices\u201d , offer a point of contact for the organisations operating integration activities , and are responsible for the integration work on the ground .",
      "Decision-making centres",
      "It is in the decision-making centres that the decision is taken on the asylum applications which are ready to be decided on of those applicants who have already been interviewed . This particularly relates to applications lodged by individuals from unsafe countries of origin such as Syria , Iraq and Eritrea . The decision-making centres thus take some of the strain from the arrival centres and branch offices .",
      "International cooperation .",
      "BAMF operates as Germanys national contact point for the European Asylum Support Office ( EASO ) , the European Migration Network ( EMN ) and the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund ( AMIF ) .",
      "Governance .",
      "Budget .",
      "BAMF is funded by the Federal Ministry of the Interior . In 2017 , the agency had an annual budget of around 780 million euros .",

Representative for Floridas 13th congressional district , based in Pinellas County , from 2014 to 2017 . A former Republican , he previously served as general counsel to his predecessor , Bill Young . He won the race for Youngs seat in a special election against Democrat Alex Sink . He was subsequently reelected in November 2014 , winning 75 percent of the vote , but was unseated in 2016 by former Governor Charlie Crist after court-ordered redistricting made his district more Democratic . Since leaving office , Jolly has become a prominent Republican critic of U.S . president Donald Trump . In September 2018 , Jolly announced he had left the Republican Party .",
      "Early life .",
      "Jolly was born in Dunedin , Florida , the son of Judith and Lawson Jolly , a Baptist pastor . He received his B.A . degree from Emory University in 1994 and his J.D . degree from the George Mason University School of Law in 2001 .",
      "Early career .",
      "He worked for Republican U.S . Representative Bill Young full-time from 1995 to 2006 in various positions , with a brief break for six months in 2001 when he worked at a Washington securities firm . In 2002 , Jolly became Youngs general counsel and held that position until he left in 2006 . He served as the personal attorney for Youngs family as well .",
      "In 2007 , Jolly joined Washington , D.C . firm Van Scoyoc Associates as a lobbyist and in 2011 , he left Van Scoyoc to open his own firm , Three Bridges Advisors . He made political donations to both Republicans ( about $36,000 ) and Democrats ( about $30,000 ) during his time as a lobbyist . Jolly had his name removed from the Lobby Registry to run for the vacant House seat . At the time , Jolly was working as vice president of the Clearwater-based investment company Boston Finance Group .",
      "Jolly and his first wife bought a condo in Indian Shores , Florida , in 2005 and a house in Washington , D.C . in 2007 . His divorce from his wife Carrie was finalized on January 16 , 2014 , and Jolly married Laura Donahoe on July 3 , 2015 .",
      "In July 2018 , Jolly became Executive Vice President and Principal of Shumaker Advisors Florida , LLC , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Shumaker , Loop , and Kendrick law firm , at their Tampa office .

      "Political career .",
      "Jolly formerly opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act but stated on an interview with MSNBC that during unemployment he had a new appreciation for its use as a safety net . He is pro-life . Speaking about firearms policy , Jolly said : I do believe the Second Amendment is a fundamental right , but I dont believe its beyond the reach of regulation , and I believe its appropriate to look at regulations that ultimately keep the guns out of the hands of criminals . He supports the Balanced Budget Amendment , and says he would have voted to raise the debt limit in early 2014 .",
      "Jolly supports sending special operations forces overseas , securing the border , increasing the vetting process for legal immigrants , and increasing surveillance of suspected domestic terrorists . In February 2014 , Jolly introduced the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Protection Act .",

      "On July 21 , 2014 , Jolly announced his support for the legality of same-sex marriage , stating : I believe in a form of limited government that protects personal liberty . To me , that means that the sanctity of one\u2019s marriage should be defined by their faith and by their church , not by their state . He said As a matter of my Christian faith , I believe in traditional marriage .",
      "In April 2016 , Jollys United States Senate campaign spokesperson Sarah Bascom confirmed that the campaign had made edits to his Wikipedia page to remove information about Jolly , including references to the Church of Scientology and his lobbying activities , alleging that it presented a public negative narrative against him , and accused an unnamed rival campaign of adding propaganda to the article . Jolly called it a careless staff mistake and said that he stands by his record and wants the public to be fully informed .",
      "Jolly was ranked as the 48th most bipartisan member of the U.S . House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress ( and the fourth most bipartisan member of the U.S .

      "Since leaving office , Jolly has participated regularly as a political commentator on cable news sources such as CNN and MSNBC ; in this capacity he has been critical of President Donald Trump and has fueled speculation that he would run for public office again .

Jolly faced Democratic nominee Alex Sink and a libertarian candidate , Lucas Overby , in the special election . The race received national attention as possibly forecasting the mid-term elections that were coming in November of that year and became the most expensive Congressional race in history , with around $11M spent , $9M of it by outside groups . During the campaign there was friction between the National Republican Congressional Committee and Jolly ; the RNC thought Jollys campaign was inept , and Jolly criticized the negative ads run by the RNC . and voters were generally unhappy with the overwhelming number of attack ads on both sides .",

      "On July 20 , 2015 , Jolly announced that he was giving up his seat to run for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Marco Rubio , who was not running for reelection due to his bid for the U.S . presidency . As of August 2015 , it appeared that Jolly would face several opponents in the August 30 , 2016 Republican primary election , including U.S . Representative Ron DeSantis and Lieutenant Governor of Florida Carlos L\u00f3pez-Cantera . However , on June 17 , 2016 , after Rubio reversed his decision , Jolly withdrew from the Senate race to run for re-election to the House , citing unfinished business .",
      "2016 general election .",
      "In his bid for a second full term , Jolly faced former Florida Governor and St . Petersburg resident Charlie Crist , a former Republican who had turned Democratic after a brief stint as an independent . He found himself in a district that had been made significantly more Democratic after a court threw out Floridas original congressional map . Notably , it absorbed a heavily Democratic portion of southern Pinellas County , including almost all of St . Petersburg . Previously , some of the more Democratic portions of St . Petersburg had been in the Tampa-based 14th District .",
      "Ultimately , Jolly lost to Crist by 51.9% to 48.1% . Jollys defeat ended a 62-year hold on this St . Petersburg-based district by the GOP . William Cramer won the seat for the Republicans in 1954 , handing it to Young in 1970 . The district had changed numbers seven times during this period , from the 1st ( 1955-1963 ) to the 12th ( 1963-1967 ) to the 8th ( 1967-1973 , 1983-1993 ) to the 6th ( 1973-1983 ) to the 10th ( 1993-2013 ) to the 13th ( 2013-present ) ."

The pilot show , pilot series , and 16 subsequent series , totalling 290 episodes in all , were originally broadcast between April 1957 . and August 1972 .",
      "Cast .",
      "In addition to Clitheroe himself , the shows stars included Peter Sinclair playing his Scottish granddad , Patricia Burke as his mother ( in some early shows the part was played by Ren\u00e9e Houston ) , and Diana Day as his long-suffering sister , Susan ( the sister , originally called Judith Clitheroe , was played in the earliest episodes by Judith Chalmers ) . Jimmys father never appeared , and his absence was never addressed .",
      "Oldham comedian Danny Ross played Alfie Hall , Susans half-witted , tongue-tied boyfriend , who was often drawn into Jimmys reckless schemes . He joined the show in 1960 , replacing Susans original boyfriend , played by Peter Goodwright .",
      "Tony Melody played Mr ( Horatio ) Higginbottom ( his first name was almost never used ) , normally known as Higgie , a taxi driver \u2014 Granddads drinking buddy , and father of Jimmys pal Ozzie . Higginbottom was always threatening to give Jimmy a good hiding for things he had done to Ozzie . Ozzie himself was rarely heard , save as an indistinct background voice in occasional early episodes ( such as The Trouble with Higginbottom ) .",
      "Several actors regularly played supporting roles in the show , including Leonard Williams ( who played both Mr Craythorpe and Harry Whittle until 1962 ) , Brian Trueman ( who played Harry Whittle from 1966 ) , and Rosalie Williams . Deryck Guyler , who had appeared in supporting roles in some early episodes , spent two years as a regular on the show , replacing Leonard Williams after the latters death .",
      "Famous guest stars included John Laurie , later best known as Private Fraser in Dads Army , playing Grandads Scottish brother , Angus , and Mollie Weir as Anguss wife ( she was well known on radio from ITMA and Life with the Lyons ) , who appeared together on at least two occasions every year from 1962 until 1970 .",
      "The lost 1956 pilot episode guest starred Irene Handl and Robert Moreton , as Jimmys aunt and uncle , with Anthea Askey as his girl cousin ( playing the roles which would eventually evolve into his Mother , Grandfather and Sister ) , and Eddie Leslie .",
      "In the 1957 pilot series , actors who appeared in guest roles included John Broadbent , Violet Carson , Fred Fairclough , Fred Ferris , Tom Harrison , Jack Howarth , Shirley King , Eddie Leslie , Bob Monkhouse , Herbert Smith , Jack Watson , and Patrick Wells .",
      "Of the 290 broadcasts aired between 1956 and 1972 , the BBC has retained 57 complete tapes ( in the BBC Sound Archive and at BBC Manchester ) , together with edited BBC Transcription Service vinyl discs preserving a further 118 episodes , making 175 recordings in all . However , almost no complete episodes exist prior to 1st January 1970 ( i.e . from the Pilot series and Series 1 to 13 ) .",
      "For the period 1956 to 1969 , supplementing the edited Transcription Service discs , 58 episodes are currently known to exist as off air recordings made by listeners , many of variable sound quality , some of which are incomplete . An on-going project exists to locate and restore the approximately sixty entirely missing episodes , for which no recording of any sort is known , and to locate better quality and more complete recordings for the others .",
      "Production .",
      "Jimmy Clitheroe was 35 years old when he started playing the part on radio , but ( in the variety theatres and , later , on television ) he could pass as an 11-year-old boy because he had never grown physically beyond that age . Although in later years his lined face gave his real age away , this was not apparent on radio .",
      "Created by James Casey in 1956 , the show was produced in Manchester , originally by the North Region studios of the BBC Home Service . But after two series were aired on North Region only , in 1959 the show was deemed sufficiently popular to be moved to the national transmitters of the BBC Light Programme .",
      "The radio show was recorded in front of a studio audience , and there were frequently gales of laughter at Jimmys schoolboy humour , or at Alfies mangling of the English language as he tried to explain something , only to make it even less clear , as well as ( to the mystification of home listeners ) Alfie Halls physical comedy , when he performed one of his trademark falls or other sight-gags .",
      "Jimmy always wore a schoolboy blazer and cap in the role , even at radio recordings , to maintain the illusion that he was 11-years-old . In the beginning ( and , in fact , for many years ) , his high-pitched voice sounded astonishingly young . And real kids never appeared on the show , as this would have shattered the carefully crafted illusion that he was a child ( the shows popularity overseas arose , in part , because audiences unfamiliar with British showbusiness believed he really was a child ) . So he discussed his pal Ozzie , and his schoolboy friends in the Black Hand Gang ( who would punish any member caught in the company of a girl ) , but the characters he spoke about were never actually heard themselves .",
      "The show ( apart from the 1957 pilot series ) was written by James Casey and Frank Roscoe ( occasionally by Ronnie Taylor , who had written the pilot series ) , and from 1958 was also produced by James Casey .",
      "Following transmission , the BBC mainly preserved the series as 154 recordings on vinyl discs , sold overseas to Commonwealth radio stations by their commercial arm , BBC Enterprises ( currently trading as BBC Worldwide and BBC Radio International ) . Altogether , the BBC retains 175 episodes , as a mixture of complete original recordings on magnetic tape and 25 minute edits on vinyl disc .",
      "Plot elements .",
      "Misunderstandings are the essence of the character-driven plots . Jimmy is depicted as frequently eavesdropping , or listening at keyholes , and as mishearing or misunderstanding what he overhears . Even when trying to do a good deed ( as when he believes Grandad has stolen money from a local shop , which he is actually only minding for the bowling club ) , he usually messes up , with the assistance of the disaster-prone Alfie .",
      "Another frequent scenario is some variation on one of Jimmys many money-making schemes , intended to finance another visit to the sweetshop , or the purchase of a new pair of roller-skates , or somesuch , but which inevitably leads to disaster .",
      "Jimmys comedy technique involves much use of a popular style known ( then as now ) as insult humour . He refers to his teachers by comic nicknames , such as Hum-ya Pete , Whistling Willie and Tick-Tock Tillie . Mr Higginbottom is frequently likened to a rampaging grizzly-bear . And Grandads Scottish ancestry is endlessly mocked , with much talk of haggis and playing the bagpipes in the bath , and he is portrayed as a man who lives only for his beer . Jimmys sister , Susan , is typically referred to as Scraggy-neck , Sparrow-legs , or occasionally the Octopus ( for her clinches with boyfriend Alfie ) .",
      "Alfie is endlessly mocked also \u2014 often countering by threatening to thump Jimmy ! Its Alfie who Jimmy refers to in his catchphrase , Dont some mothers ave em! ? Mr Higginbottom is also mocked whenever he appears : among other things , his house is said to be a rat-infested dump . But Jimmy treads carefully in this , because the bad-tempered Higginbottom is known for his hair-trigger temper . Higginbottoms son , the much-maligned Ozzie , is a fat kid who Jimmy calls his best friend.. . while frequently thrashing him , mocking him , and involving him in his wild schemes .",
      "The one person who escapes Jimmys ready wit is his mother . In real life , his father had died and he was devoted to his widowed mother ; so he wouldnt stand for either his real mother , or his radio mother , being mocked . She is the calm centre around which the chaos revolves .",
      "Susan occasionally turns the tables on her little brother ( Jimmy was only ) , in return . In the episode Enough to Make a Kitten Laugh , Susan tricks Jimmy into buying back a lost kitten that he had sold to Ozzie , by offering a reward for it in the local newspaper ( under an assumed name ) , but warns Mr Higginbottom that Jimmy wants it back , so that he has to pay double what Ozzie had paid him . But when Jimmy discovers the trick , he gets the last laugh , selling the kitten ( at a profit ) to an employee at the newspaper , who then turns up at home to demand the reward shes offered .",
      "After the end credits , Jimmy would usually deliver a short epilogue , addressed to the audience , tying up loose ends in the plot and , frequently , reporting that Grandad has given him the ( expected ) good spanking for the trouble he caused .",

      "Old Hansen Planetarium",
      "The Old Hansen Planetarium at 15 South State Street in Salt Lake City , Utah has served many functions throughout its history . Originally built in 1904 as the Salt Lake City Public Library , the building was renovated in 1965 to become the Hansen Planetarium . After the planetarium closed and was replaced by the Clark Planetarium in 2003 , the building was remodeled into the O.C . Tanner Company Flagship jewelry store , which opened in 2009 . The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 .",
      "Salt Lake City Public Library .",
      "The first public library in Salt Lake City opened in 1898 and was located in the top floor of the Salt Lake City and County Building . After the library quickly outgrew the venue , the city began looking for a location to build a new library . A group of women called the Ladies Literary Society helped out by persuading the mining millionaire John Quackenbos Packard to donate land and money for the new building , which cost $100,000 at the time . The new library opened in 1905 with librarian Joanna Sprague , for whom the Sprague branch of the Salt Lake City Public Library system , also listed on the National Register of Historic Places , is now named . The building would continue to serve as the main branch library until October 1964 , when a new library building was constructed at 209 East 500 South .",
      "When the building was constructed , it was described as a combination of the Doric and Ionian styles of architecture , and would later be classified in the Beaux Arts style . It was designed by Heins & LaFarge of New York City , and the local supervising architect was Frederick A . Hale . The library was three stories tall with a two-story entrance pavilion constructed of oolite limestone and of floor space . The roof was slightly flared , and the roofline was broken by a large carved stone gable with a center arched window and four decorated pilasters . The entrance pavilions sides were curved around the spiral staircases at both ends of the entrance foyer . The pavilion was divided into three sections by four columns ; each bay contained oak double doors leading to the foyer . After going through the foyer , the main reading room is revealed . In the center of the room stood a librarians desk made of steel and topped by golden oak , the same finish of the interior of the entrance foyer . On the upper floor , the main auditorium contained seating for 350 people .",
      "Hansen Planetarium .",
      "After the new library was constructed in 1964 , Gail Plummer , professor of speech and drama at the University of Utah and chairman of the Salt Lake City Library board , expressed interest in converting the old library into a planetarium . Plummer had several conversations with Mrs . Beatrice M . Hansen , wife of the late George T . Hansen , in which Mrs . Hansen decided to fund the project . In 1965 she donated $400,000 to the city to build the planetarium in memory of her deceased husband . After Mrs . Hansens death the building was renamed the Mr . and Mrs . George T . Hansen Planetarium , Space Science Library and Museum in honor of the couple . During its operation , the planetarium attracted 20% of the population of the city and had the highest per capita attendance of any planetarium in the nation . The Hansen Planetarium continued operation until April 2003 , when it outgrew the building and was replaced by the Clark Planetarium in The Gateway .",
      "When the Hansen Planetarium occupied the building , the center doors of the entrance pavilion were replaced by a large sheet of glass , and the center part of the steps was replaced with a fountain . A mezzanine was added above the second floor in the entrance pavilion for exhibit in the planetarium . The same firm that did the original millwork for the 1904 building worked on these new additions . The local architect for the additions was Wesley Budd . A large dome was also added onto the rear wall of the building to give the planetarium extra space for its exhibits .",
      "O . C . Tanner Company .",
      "After four years of lying vacant , the O . C . Tanner Company bought the building in 2007 for $1.2 million . Before Tanner came along , two referendums to fund the empty building were rejected , but the jeweling companys clear plan got the votes it needed . The company spent two years and $24 million renovating the building , which opened in September 2009 . The company itself supplied a majority of the funds ( $13\u201315 million ) , and the remainder came from the community .",
      "Upon the companys purchase of the building , O.C . Tanners staff decided to try to mimic the original architecture as closely as possible . Because of this , the dome at the rear of the building was removed . Instead of simply demolishing the dome , however , it was systematically dismantled and donated to the Zions Gateway to the Stars planetarium in Orderville , Utah . Also , the front staircase was restored to its original condition by removing the fountain in the center , which , coincidentally , was donated by O . C . Tanner himself .",
      "Only three of the four walls\u2014the sides and front\u2014were preserved in Tanners restoration . Since the back had already been altered by the Hansen Planetarium and there were no original images of that wall from the 1905 building , Curtis Bennett , vice president of the companys retail operations , was allowed a little freedom with that design . The rear wall now consists of glass and stone , both etched with images of the buildings history . The rear wall contains the largest laser stone-carving project in the world with 18 panels covering and weighing in all . The bottom of the rear wall contains repeated images from the library in 1905 , the top contains images of a galaxy ( signifying the Hansen Planetarium ) , and the middle contains an image of the founder of the company , O.C . Tanner . The image on the glass is a dot-matrix image , but the stone imaging required a new process developed specifically for this building .",
      "Inside the building , a new limestone spiral staircase was built with a Flora Cascade chandelier hanging in the center of the spiral . The chandelier was designed by Sharon Marston and includes about 4,000 strands of fiber optics , more than 14,000 interwoven shapes made of white polymer and steel , and about 3,000 golden and amber glass leaves . Weighing and extending from the ceiling , the chandelier stretches nearly the entire height of the building .",

      "The 108th Training Command ( Initial Entry Training ) is a United States Army Reserve unit headquartered in Charlotte , North Carolina . At its activation , the unit was designated as the 108th Airborne Division , but in 1952 was redesignated the 108th Infantry Division . In 1956 , the division was again reorganized , this time to the designation as the 108th Division ( Institutional Training ) . Under the U.S . Army Reserve Transformation of 2005 , the 108th was reorganized to is current structure as the 108th Training Command ( Initial Entry Training ( IET ) ) . The command is currently one of the largest in the Army Reserve , commanding and coordinating 9,000 soldiers .",
      "The 108th Training Command ( IET ) is a subordinate unit in the United States Army Reserve ( USAR ) which is a federal reserve force of the United States Army . Together , the USAR and the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) constitute the Reserve Components ( RC ) of the United States Army .",
      "Over its 75-year history , the 108th Division frequently has been called upon to pilot several new missions for the Army and Army Reserve . Over the years , the division has played an important role in pioneering and developing several training methods and policies still in use today .",

      "The 108th Division was activated in 1946 as the 108th Airborne Division of the United States Army Reserve and was headquartered in Atlanta , Georgia . Manning during this period was relatively small and funding for airborne training , equipment , and airlift support was minimal .",
      "In 1952 , the division was reorganized into an infantry division and its headquarters was moved to its present location in Charlotte , North Carolina with all its subordinate units located in either North or South Carolina . In 1954 , the division helped test a new method of rifle qualification known as trainfire . In 1956 , the division was selected to serve as a prototype for an Army Training Division . This meant reorganizing again to conduct basic and advanced individual training , should the division be called to active duty .",

      "In the 1960s , the division established its own drill sergeant school patterned after the active component school . In 1968 , the 108th Division was restructured under its current brigade concept . During the Vietnam era , 108th Division soldiers during annual training were used to conduct interim training for soldiers waiting to begin basic training . In the 1980s the division developed an updated and more practical mobilization plan . During those same years the division began conducting basic training by themselves at Fort Jackson under new Mobilization Army Training Center and Provisional Training concepts .",

The soldiers assisted in the retraining of individual soldiers at Fort Jackson who were recalled up to military duty . In late 1993 , the 108th Division accepted the mission to pilot a new concept in Army training called Future Army Schools Twenty-first Century . This not only expanded the geographic size of the 108th Division to add the states of Georgia and Florida , but added 10 new US Army Reserve Forces schools to the divisions force structure . Those schools were later reorganized into functionally aligned school brigades .",
      "This gave the 108th Division a new mission . While keeping its mission of conducting initial entry training for new soldiers entering the Army , it now conducts specialized skill training for thousands of soldiers , both officers and enlisted , in the southeastern part of the United States .",
      "In 1996 the 108th Division was assigned another completely new mission to conduct Reserve Officer Training Corps training at three colleges and universities in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina .

      "Regius Professor of Civil Law ( Oxford )",
      "The Regius Chair of Civil Law , founded in the 1540s , is one of the oldest of the professorships at the University of Oxford .",
      "Foundation .",
      "The Regius Chair of Civil Law at Oxford was founded by King Henry VIII , who established five such Regius Professorships in the University , the others being the chairs of Divinity , Physic ( Old English for Medicine ) , Hebrew and Greek . The stipend attached to the position was then forty pounds a year . Henry VIII put an end to the teaching of Canon law at both Oxford and Cambridge . Under statutes of 1549 , the Regius Professor of Civil Law was to lecture four times a week between the hours of eight and nine in the morning on the Pandects , on the Code , or on the ecclesiastical laws of England . The requirement to give four lectures a week was repeated in the statutes of 1564 and of 1576 . The professor was also to moderate at disputations in law .",
      "The exact date of the chairs foundation is uncertain . Some sources say that John Story , the first professor , was appointed in about 1541 . No foundation document survives , but in 1544 Robert Weston was recorded as acting as Storys deputy .",
      "The holder of the Regius Professorship is still chosen by The Crown and is still appointed to teach Roman law , its principles and history , and some other branches of the law .",
      "First Professor .",
      "It is uncertain when the first Regius Professor , the Blessed John Story , was first appointed . The History of the University of Oxford says that it was by a signed bill , c . 1541 , adding that , together with Robert Weston , Story was reappointed for life by letters patent dated 26 February 1546 . Payments to Story as professor of Civil Law are found in the accounts of the Treasurer of the Court of Augmentations for the periods Michaelmas 1546 to Michaelmas 1550 , part of 1553 , and 1556\u20131557 , and for fees and annuities in issues of the Exchequer for 1553\u20131557 .",
      "Story had a tempestuous career . Elected to parliament in 1547 , in 1548 he opposed the anti-Roman Catholic laws of King Edward VI , was imprisoned , and on release fled to the Seventeen Provinces . The reign of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary from July 1553 to November 1558 brought Story back into public life . He became a member of parliament again , and after Marys death opposed the Act of Supremacy of 1559 . He was again imprisoned , escaped , was recaptured , and fled again to the Low Countries , where he became a subject of Philip II of Spain . He was kidnapped by agents of Queen Elizabeth I , imprisoned in the Tower of London , where he was tortured , and finally in 1571 was hanged , drawn and quartered .",
      "Story was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1886 .",
      "Period of decline .",
      "Although prestigious , the Regius Chair has not always been effective for teaching purposes . In 1846 , a Select committee of the House of Commons began to inquire into the state of legal education in the United Kingdom , and its report later the same year showed the emptiness of the title of Regius Professor of Civil Law at Oxford at that time . Dr Joseph Phillimore , who had held the Chair since 1809 and who continued to hold it until his death in 1855 at the age of eighty , admitted in a series of evasive replies to the Select Committee that his subject had not been taught at Oxford for almost a hundred years . Dr Philip Bliss , Registrar of the University , revealed that the University had no examinations in any legal science . Although the degree of Bachelor of Civil Law was still awarded , the disputations which led to such an award were an empty formality .",
      "One of Phillimores eighteenth century predecessors , Robert Vansittart , a noted antiquarian and rake , was appointed Regius Professor in 1767 and held the chair until his death in 1789 . He published antiquarian works , was a close acquaintance of Samuel Johnson , William Hogarth and Paul Whitehead , and was a participant in the debauchery of the Hellfire Club . Vansittarts successor , Thomas Francis Wenman ( 1745\u20131796 ) , Regius Professor from 1789 until his death , is described in the Dictionary of National Biography as one of the few students of natural history at Oxford and was drowned in the River Cherwell on 8 April 1796 , while collecting botanical specimens .",
      "Modern period .",
      "After the death of Phillimore in 1855 , the situation improved somewhat . Although the next professor , Sir Travers Twiss , held degrees in Mathematics and Literae Humaniores , he came to the post directly from three years as professor of international law at Kings College , London , where the teaching of law was taken more seriously than at Oxford . His international reputation led to Leopold II , king of the Belgians asking him to draft the constitution of the Congo Free State .",
      "Twiss was succeeded in 1870 by James Bryce , 1st Viscount Bryce , a distinguished historian and Liberal politician who for a period combined the Regius chair of civil law with holding office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and who resigned the chair only in 1893 , a year after joining William Ewart Gladstones Cabinet .",
      "In 1955 , the distinguished German academic lawyer David Daube ( 1909\u20131999 ) , a native of Freiburg im Breisgau , became the first foreign-born Regius Professor of Civil Law at Oxford since the 17th century . He was later a professor-in-residence at the University of California , Berkeley .",
      "Daube was succeeded in 1971 by Tony Honor\u00e9 ( born 1921 ) , a jurist known for his work on ownership , causation and Roman law , who remained in post until 1988 . Although born in London , he was brought up in South Africa , fought in the Second World War and was severely wounded at the First Battle of El Alamein . His contributions to legal philosophy include sixteen books and more than a hundred articles .",
      "In 1988 , Peter Birks was appointed , holding office until his death in 2004 . He was a specialist on the law of Restitution .",
      "After a vacancy of more than a year , Professor Boudewijn Sirks was appointed in December 2005 and took up the post in 2006 , his previous career having been in teaching philosophy and law at the universities of Leiden , Amsterdam , Utrecht , and Frankfurt .",
      "In 2015 , Sirks was succeeded by Wolfgang Ernst .",

      "City of Rocks National Reserve",
      "The City of Rocks National Reserve , also known as the Silent City of Rocks , is a United States National Reserve and state park in south-central Idaho , approximately north of the border with Utah . It is widely known for its enormous granite rock formations and excellent rock climbing .",
      "The rock spires in the City of Rocks and adjacent Castle Rocks State Park are largely composed of granitic rock of the Oligocene Almo pluton and Archean Green Creek Complex . City of Rocks is also a popular rock climbing area , with over 1,000 traditional and bolt-protected routes . In the 1980s , it was home to some of the most difficult routes in the country , mostly developed by Idaho climber Tony Yaniro . Climbers in the region refer to the area as simply The City .",
      "During the 1840s and 1850s , wagon trains on the California Trail left the Raft River valley and traveled through the area and over Granite Pass into Nevada . Names or initials of emigrants written in axle grease are still visible on Register Rock , and ruts from wagon wheels can be seen in some of the rocks .",
      "History .",
      "In 1849 , an emigrant party with James Wilkins encamped at the city of the rocks on the California Trail just north of the Great Salt Lake Desert . Signatures in axle grease on rock faces can be seen today . One emigrant saw the distant rocks in August like water thrown up into the air from numerous artificial hydrants . Beginning in 1843 , City of Rocks was a landmark for emigrants on the California Trail and Salt Lake Alternate Trail and later on freight routes and the Kelton , Utah to Boise , Idaho stage route .",
      "The areas historical and geological values , scenery , and opportunities for recreation led to its designation as City of Rocks National Reserve in 1988 . This unit of the National Park System is managed cooperatively by the National Park Service and the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation .",
      "Native American history .",
      "The Shoshone and Bannock tribes hunted the buffalo that once roamed in the City of Rocks area and gathered the nuts of the pinyon pine trees . The arrival of horses in the Americas in the 16th century and swelling European immigration disrupted the Shoshone-Bannock homelands and traditional way of life . They grew to resent the intruders but could do little to stop them . Most emigrants on the California Trail saw no Native Americans , but some of their journals record smoke rising from high hills and the surrounding mountains .",
      "In 1826 , Peter Skene Ogden and his Snake River brigade of beaver trappers were the first Euro-Americans to note the City of Rocks . Having few beaver , the area was ignored until 1843 , when growing streams of wagons began flowing through the area in the summer .",
      "California Trail .",
      "After many attempts to find a wagon route to California early California settlers like Joseph B . Chiles and mountain men such as Joseph R . Walker found the route up the Raft River , through the City of Rocks , over Granite Pass and down a series of streams like Goose Creek and Thousand Springs to the Humboldt River . From the junction of the Humboldt near todays Wells , Nevada they could follow the Humboldt west to the Sierra Nevada ( U.S. ) and on to California . Both Chiles , Walker and later John C . Fremont led settlers over this route . Later wagon parties seldom used guides but followed the tracks of the early pioneers wagons or the wagons in front of them . By 1850 so many people were on the trail that it was often like a long traveling village crawling its way to California . Newspapers and independent publishers in the east or mid-west often published emigrant guides that could be bought for little money from several different authors by 1850 . The City of Rocks and the nearby Granite Pass ( Idaho ) marked roughly half way to California for the emigrants and their loaded wagons . By 1846 , some emigrants headed for Oregons Willamette Valley also used this route as part of the Applegate Trail . This rugged cutoff was little used in later years .",
      "In 1848 Samuel J . Hensley , a pioneer that accompanied Joseph B . Chiles in 1842 , pioneered the Salt Lake Cutoff from Salt Lake City north of the Great Salt Lake when he traveled east while returning to Missouri . The Salt Lake cutoff rejoined the main California Trail near the City of Rocks . Settlers using the Salt Lake Cutoff traveled about the same number of miles as settlers going by way of Fort Hall and west along the Snake River valley route . In 1852 , some 52,000 people passed through the City of Rocks on their way to join the California Gold Rush .",
      "When the California Trail was first opened in 1843 , Granite Pass , near City of Rocks provided the pass that allowed an easy connection with streams and creeks that provided the needed water and grass for their teams along the way between the Raft River and the Humboldt River . After 1850 the Pass initially became part of Utah Territory , and in 1872 an Idaho-Utah boundary survey error establishing the Utah-Idaho boundary . placed Granite Pass in Idaho Territory . With the completion of the first transcontinental railroad on 9 May 1869 , the overland wagon routes began to pass into history . However , wagons and stage lines saw continued use on regional supply routes that spread out from the railroad line to cities not on the railway line ( s ) .",
      "John Halleys stage route connected the railroad ( CPRR ) station at Kelton , Utah , with Idahos mining hub of Boise , Idaho , and supplied the early economic development of Idaho , which won statehood in 1890 . The Kelton stage route passed through the City of Rocks , with a stage station set up near the junction of the old California Trail and the Salt Lake Cutoff . Settlers began to homestead the City of Rocks area in the late 19th century . Dryland farming declined during the drought years of the 1920s and 1930s , but ranching survived . Livestock grazing began with early wagon use of the area in the mid-19th century and continues today .",
      "One of the favorite camping spots for emigrants was Camp Rock . Emigrants wrote on the stone face with axle grease writing out their names and dates of passage .",
      "Facts and designations .",
      "The Idaho Legislature declared Section 36 within City of Rocks as a state park under the jurisdiction of the Idaho Land Board on February 27 , 1957 . In 1964 , a much larger area ( more than ) was designated a National Historic Landmark . On March 15 , 1973 , Section 36 was transferred to the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation from the Department of Lands . The following year , the area was designated a National Natural Landmark . The National Park Service studied the site in the 1970s and 80s as a proposed national monument .",
      "City of Rocks National Reserve was created November 18 , 1988 by Public Law 100-696 , Arizona-Idaho Conservation Act of 1988 . This Act drew a boundary around owned or managed by the USDA Forest Service , Bureau of Land Management , Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation ( IDPR ) , and private individuals . All lands owned by the United States within the Reserve boundaries were placed under the authority of the National Park Service ( NPS ) . Between 1988 and 1996 , the Reserve was co-managed by both NPS and IDPR . After the approval of a comprehensive management plan , the NPS officially transferred on-site management of the Reserve to IDPR on May 2 , 1996 . Today , the park functions under a unique cooperative agreement between the NPS and IDPR . Both agencies allocate partial funding to its operation . City of Rocks National Reserve is visited annually by over 80,000 visitors . The Reserve headquarters is located in the gateway community of Almo .",
      "Environment .",
      "City of Rocks , an extraordinary encirclement of granite rising out of the gently rolling sagebrush country in south-central Idaho , has attracted and intrigued people since they first entered this region . The Shoshone camped here as did the emigrants traveling along the California Trail . One of the reserves most notable qualities is its large degree of biological diversity concentrated in a relatively small area . The great variety of textures , colors , and shapes in the natural landscape contributes considerably to the reserves scenic quality .",
      "Geologic formations .",
      "The landscape of City of Rocks has been sculpted from granite that was intruded into the crust during two widely spaced times . The granite that composes most of the spires is part of the 28-million-year-old Almo pluton . However , some of the spires are made of granite that is part of the 2.5 billion-year-old Green Creek Complex that contains some of the oldest rocks in the western United States . The granite has eroded into a fascinating assortment of shapes .",
      "City of Rocks was designated a National Reserve , a unit of the National Park Service , in recognition of the nationally significant geological and scenic values of its rock formations and the historical significance of the California Trail . Rock formations in the reserve developed through an erosion process called exfoliation , during which thin rock plates and scales sloughed off along joints in the rocks . The joints , or fractures , resulted from the contraction of the granite as it cooled , from an upward expansion of the granite as overlying materials were eroded away , and from regional tectonic stresses . The granite has eroded into a fascinating assortment of shapes as high as . The upper surfaces of many of the rocks are covered with flat-floored weathering pits known as panholes . The most notable panhole is located on top of Bath Rock and is continuously filled with water from rain or snowmelt .",
      "Animals .",
      "Located in the Northern Basin and Range/Snake-Columbia shrub steppe ecoregions and the Raft Watershed of the Upper Snake River Basin , the habitat of the reserve supports a large variety of mammals , birds , reptiles , and invertebrates .",
      "- Amphibians - Common amphibians that could be found near water include boreal toad , Great Basin spadefoot toad , and northern leopard frog .",
      "- Birds - The reserve provides excellent breeding and prey habitat for many raptor species including golden eagle , prairie falcon , red-tailed hawk , northern harrier , sharp-shinned hawk , Coopers hawk , American kestrel , turkey vulture , and great horned owl . Swainsons hawk and ferruginous hawk are less abundant in the reserve . Other common bird species includes sage grouse , pinon jay , Clarks nutcracker , common nighthawk , rock doves , mourning doves , cliff swallow , mountain bluebird , hermit thrush , mountain chickadee , rock wren , house wren , solitary vireos , warbling vireos , green-tailed towhee , Virginias warbler , Brewers blackbird , and various sparrows .",
      "- Mammals - A partial list of mammals in the reserve includes , cougar , mule deer , coyote , bobcat , badger , yellow-bellied marmot , cliff chipmunk , mountain cottontail rabbit , black-tailed jackrabbit , snowshoe hare , northern grasshopper mouse , Merriams shrew , several species of voles , and a variety of bats . Pronghorn and bison were probably common a century ago .",
      "- Reptiles - Typical lizard species include the western whiptail , western fence lizard , Long-nosed leopard lizard , sagebrush lizard , and northern desert horned lizard . Snakes include the western rattlesnake , Great Basin gopher snake , striped whipsnake , and wandering garter snake . The western rattlesnake is the only strongly venomed snake found in the reserve .",
      "Plants .",
      "Notable plant life includes :",
      "- The Kruckebergs sword fern is found in the cool , moist micro-habitats in the granite formations . The fern grows in rock crevices and is normally found at higher elevations than City of Rocks . Primary threats to this species are trampling and or removal by visitors along rock climbing routes .",

      "The majority of the soils in the reserve are composed of grus , a coarse angular sand derived from the disintegration of the underlying granitic bedrock . They are highly erodible . Soil erosion is greatest near roads and on steep slopes and intermittent stream channels . Erosion in these areas has formed deep gullies . Some of the exposed soil banks are over high .",

      "History .",
      "Beginnings .",
      "Razorfish was founded in New York in 1994 by childhood friends Craig Kanarick and Jeff Dachis , with the motto Solutions to Hard Problems . The company was originally headquartered at Jeffs apartment in Alphabet City in Manhattan . Their first major project was a $20,000 assignment to create a small website for the New York Botanical Society , commissioned by Time Warners Pathfinder business unit . A few months later , they moved into an office at 580 Broadway and hired three new employees .",
      "Early success .",
      "The company generated over $300,000 in revenues in 1995 and over $1.2m in 1996 , with a $300k EBITDA profit .",
      "They were one of the first companies to have an animated homepage , utilizing the server-push capabilities of the latest version of the Netscape browser . Because of this and aggressive marketing tactics the firm grew quickly over the next few years . Soon thereafter , they received a strategic investment from Omnicom ( along with other New Media pioneers , Agency.com , Red Sky Interactive , Think New Ideas and Organic ) , making them one of the first firms to be financed by a traditional media holding company . Razorfish used this money to move to new offices , redesign their branding ( to include the slogan Everything that can be digital will be. ) and expand operations . It and other New York-based Web design companies formed the core of a cluster of New Media companies known as Silicon Alley .",
      "In 1997 , the company generated over $3.6 million in revenues , with a healthy portfolio of prestigious clients like KPMG and Charles Schwab .",
      "In January 1998 , Razorfish made its first of what was to be many acquisitions , by purchasing Avalanche Systems . In 1998 , Razorfish also acquired Plastic in San Francisco , London-based CHBi , Los Angeles-based <tag> media , and then merged with Scandinavian interactive leader , Spray , which had offices in Sweden , Finland , Norway and Germany .",
      "The company generated over $83 million in revenue in 1998 and was profitable , putting it on solid ground for an IPO . The company had over 1,100 employees at the time .",
      "In April 1999 , the company had an IPO which raised $48 million at $16 per share .",
      "In fall 1999 , Razorfish acquired International Integration , Inc . ( I-Cube ) , a Boston-based company founded by Yannis Doganis , Madhav Anand , and Edouard ( Eddie ) Aslanian , its largest deal to date . The companys sales for 1999 topped $170 million .",
      "In May 2000 , Razorfish announced the launch of Intervision-Razorfish , a joint venture based in Tokyo . Around the same time , as the entire industry started to feel the effects of the dot-com bubble , Razorfish saw Q4 revenues of $50.1m , a 5% drop from the year before . Total revenues for 2000 were almost $268 million . In February 2001 , Razorfish laid off 400 employees , roughly 20 percent of its staff , with its stock price descending from a February 2000 high of $57 to just $1 per share .",

      "Sarah Hammond Palfrey Danzig ( n\u00e9e Palfrey ; September 18 , 1912 \u2013 February 27 , 1996 ) was an American tennis player whose career spanned two decades from the late 1920s until the late 1940s . She won two singles , nine womens doubles , and four mixed doubles titles at the U.S . National Championships .",
      "Career .",
      "She was 32 years old , married to Elwood Cooke , and a mother when she won her second singles title at the 1945 U.S . National Championships . Pauline Betz was her opponent in the final . Since she lost to Cooke in the 1941 final , Betz had won three consecutive titles and 19 consecutive matches at these championships . In 1945 , Cooke lost the first set and squandered her 5\u20132 lead in the second set before recovering to win it 8\u20136 . In the third set , Betz got close to winning yet another title when she served for a 5\u20133 lead . Cooke , however , broke her serve and then won the next two games to win the tournament . She became only the second mother to win this title , with Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman being the first .",
      "Cooke is one of the few women , if not the sole woman , to appear on a top-level male championship honor roll . Because of the manpower crisis during World War II , she and husband Elwood were permitted to enter the mens doubles at the 1945 Tri-State Championships in Cincinnati . They lost in the final to Hal Surface and Bill Talbert .",
      "Palfrey won 16 Grand Slam championships in womens doubles ( 11 ) and mixed doubles ( 5 ) . She teamed with Betty Nuthall to win the 1930 U.S . National Championships and with Helen Jacobs to win the 1932 , 1934 , and 1935 championships . Palfrey and Alice Marble won the U.S . National Championships from 1937 through 1940 . At the Wimbledon Championships , Palfrey and Marble won the 1938 and 1939 womens doubles titles . Palfreys last U.S . womens doubles championship was in 1941 with Margaret Osborne . In mixed doubles , Palfrey teamed with four different partners to win the U.S . National Championships : Fred Perry ( 1932 ) , Enrique Maier ( 1935 ) , Don Budge ( 1937 ) , and Jack Kramer ( 1941 ) . Palfrey also won the mixed doubles title at the 1939 French International Championships , teaming with future husband Elwood Cooke .",
      "Palfrey and Marble were undefeated in doubles from 1937 until Marble turned professional at the end of 1940 .",
      "In 1947 , Cooke and Betz went on a barnstorming tour of mostly one-night stands in the U.S . and Europe , with each earning about US$10,000 . They had been stripped of their amateur status by the United States Lawn Tennis Association ( USLTA ) in early 1947 because Elwood Cooke had written letters to several tournament organizers about creating a professional tour .",
      "According to A . Wallis Myers and John Olliff of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail , Palfrey was one of the 10 highest ranked women in the world from 1933 through 1936 and in 1938 and 1939 . Her career high was fourth in 1934 . ( No world rankings were issued from 1940 through 1945. )",
      "Palfrey was included in the year-end top 10 rankings issued by the USLTA 1929\u20131931 , 1933\u20131941 , and 1945 . She was the top-ranked U.S . player in 1941 and 1945 .",
      "Palfrey and Marble lobbied the USLTA to remove the color bar and allow Althea Gibson to play at heretofore whites-only tournaments beginning in 1950 . She [ Palfrey ] was calmly persuasive , had clout as an ex-champ , and got Althea into the U.S . [ National ] Championships in 1950 , said Gladys Heldman , founder of the womens professional tennis tour in 1970 .",
      "Palfrey once said , Tennis is the best game there is . It combines mental and physical qualities and is the sport for a lifetime . And there are many living examples at the age of 80 to prove it . So it is enough for us to know that tennis will remain , under whatever conditions , whether amateur or pro , the finest game there is for us , for our children , and our childrens children .",
      "Palfrey was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1963 .",
      "Palfrey and Marty Glickman covered the home games of the 1946-47 New York Knicks on WHN radio . Glickman handled play-by-play duties while Palfrey provided the color commentary . The New York Times stated in what is said to be the first time that an outstanding woman sports figure has been assigned to such a chore , Sarah Palfrey Cooke , tennis champion , will provide the color accounts of the games .",
      "Personal life .",
      "She had two children and was married three times : to Marshal Fabyan , Elwood Cooke , and Jerome Alan Danzig . She married Fabyan on October 6 , 1934 , but divorced him in Reno , Nevada on July 20 , 1940 . She married Cooke on October 2 , 1940 , and their daughter was born in December 1942 . She divorced him on April 29 , 1949 , on grounds of cruelty . She married Danzig on April 27 , 1951 , and remained married to him until her death of lung cancer in 1996 . Their son was born in December 1952 .",
      "Her brother John Palfrey , also an excellent tennis player and an expert on atomic energy , married Belle Clochette Roosevelt Palfrey , a granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt and a daughter of Kermit Roosevelt .",

      "Guy Whittingham",
      "Guy Whittingham ( born 10 November 1964 ) is an English former professional footballer and a manager . He was caretaker manager of Football League Two side Portsmouth from November 2012 until April 2013 when he took the role on a permanent basis before being sacked by Portsmouth in November 2013 . On 13 December 2013 , he was appointed assistant manager at Crawley Town .",
      "As a player , he was a striker from 1988 until 2005 , notably in the Premier League for Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday . Having started his career with non-league Yeovil Town he went on to play in the Football League for Portsmouth , Wolverhampton Wanderers , Watford , Peterborough United , Oxford United and Wycombe Wanderers . He amassed over 450 appearances throughout his career .",
      "Playing career .",
      "Born in Evesham , after leaving the British Army , he joined Waterlooville for the start of the 1987\u201388 season where , after two games for the reserves , he was quickly promoted to the first team and became the clubs top goalscorer in the 1987\u201388 season . One of his goals came in the first round proper of the F.A.Cup against Aylesbury United . He then spent a season at Yeovil Town before , in the summer of 1989 , he was signed by Portsmouth , where he then spent the majority of his career , scoring 99 times in 173 league appearances , including Pompeys all-time scoring record of 42 league goals in the 1992\u201393 season ( 48 in all competitions ) as the club missed out on automatic promotion to the Premier League on goals scored . He was known while at Fratton Park as Corporal Punishment . In 1993 he signed for Aston Villa in the Premier League . He had a good run in the team and scored important goals against Everton , Arsenal and Sheffield United , before leaving on loan in February 1994 to join Wolverhampton Wanderers ; this meant he missed out on Villas victory in the 1994 Football League Cup Final . In December 1994 he joined Sheffield Wednesday , proving to be very popular at the Owls . Whilst at Wednesday he had a second loan spell at Wolves , as well as being loaned to Watford and Portsmouth who he would later rejoin permanently in 1999 . At Portsmouth during his loan spell his seven goals in nine matches helped the club avoid relegation to the third tier .",
      "In the 2000\u201301 season , his last as a professional , he scored for three clubs , notching for Peterborough United ( against Oldham Athletic ) , Oxford United ( against Swindon Town ) and Wycombe Wanderers ( against Bristol City ) . He also featured in Wycombes FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool . This was the second time that Whittingham had been denied in an FA Cup semi-final by the Merseyside team , having lost in a penalty shootout to Liverpool whilst at Portsmouth in 1992 .",
      "Management and coaching career .",
      "Whittingham later went on to become player-manager of Newport ( IOW ) , but left them in May 2005 when the club ran into financial difficulties . He returned to management at AFC Newbury but when that club suffered financial difficulties and the loss of their ground , Whittingham left in June 2006 . In August 2006 he took up a coaching role at Eastleigh . In January 2009 , he joined the Portsmouth first-team coaching staff as development coach .",
      "He was named joint caretaker manager of Portsmouth together with Stuart Gray on 14 October 2011 , when Steve Cotterill left to become manager of Nottingham Forest . The next day the pair won their first game in charge against Barnsley 2\u20130 at Fratton Park .",
      "Whittingham once again became caretaker manager of the south coast club following Michael Appleton leaving to take the vacant position at Blackpool , and stayed as caretaker until the club exited administration in April 2013 , with his full-time appointing imminent .

      "Federation of the Greens",
      "The Federation of the Greens ( , FdV ) , frequently referred to as Greens ( Verdi ) , is a green political party in Italy . It was formed in 1990 by the merger of the Federation of Green Lists and the Rainbow Greens .",
      "Currently , Matteo Badiali and Elena Grandi serve as the partys two spokespersons , while Angelo Bonelli , a former president , spokesperson and member of the Chamber of Deputies , is its national coordinator .",
      "The FdV is part of the European Green Party and the Global Greens .",
      "History .",
      "Background and foundation .",
      "The Federation of Green Lists was formed in 1984 by leading environmentalists and anti-nuclear activists , notably including Gianni Mattioli , Gianfranco Amendola , Massimo Scalia and Alexander Langer .",
      "The party made its debut at the 1987 general election and obtained 2.6% of the vote , gaining 13 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and two Senators . Later that year , the Greens successfully campaigned for three referendums aimed at stopping nuclear power in Italy , which had been proposed by the left-liberal Radical Party and was eventually supported by the countrys three main parties ( Christian Democrats , Communists and Socialists ) .",
      "At the 1989 European Parliament election there were two competing green parties : the LV and the Rainbow Greens ( VA ) , formed mainly by Radicals , including Adelaide Aglietta , Franco Corleone , Adele Faccio , Marco Taradash and Francesco Rutelli , as well as splinters from Proletarian Democracy , including Mario Capanna , Guido Pollice , Gianni Tamino and Edo Ronchi . The two lists obtained a combined 6.2% of the vote , of which 3.8% for the LV and 2.4% for the VA , and 5 MEPs .",
      "In 1990 the two parties joined forces to form the Federation of the Greens , which inherited from the LV the Smiling Sun symbol of the northern European anti-nuclear movement , designed by Danish activist Anne Lund in 1975 . In the 1992 general election the new party won 2.8% of the vote , returning 16 deputies and 4 senators . The party was briefly a member of the Ciampi Cabinet formed 28 April 1993 , its sole minister resigning a day after the cabinets swearing-in ceremony .",
      "Centre-left coalitions .",
      "In 1993 the Greens joined forces with the Democratic Party of the Left ( PDS ) within the Alliance of Progressives , a broad left-wing coalition . As a result , Rutelli was elected mayor of Rome . The party was also joined by Carlo Ripa di Meana , a former Socialist member of the European Commission and minister of the Environment , who became the partys leader .",
      "In the 1994 European Parliament election won 3.2% of the vote and three MEPs , its best result as a joint party .",
      "In 1995 the Greens were a founding member of The Olive Tree coalition and in the 1996 general election , thanks to this alliance and several candidates in single-seat constituencies , they obtained 14 deputies and 14 senators , their highest number ever . Following the election , the Greens the centre-left governments led by Romano Prodi , Massimo DAlema and Giuliano Amato . Ronchi was minister of the Environment ( 1996\u20132000 ) and Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio minister of Agriculture ( 2000\u20132001 ) .",
      "Since 1996 the party however started a slow decline . Some of its leading members left : Rutelli ( who was re-elected mayor of Rome ) in 1997 and Ripa di Meana in 1998 . The party also suffered the competition of several centre-left parties , some of them new as The Democrats , of which Rutelli was a founding member . In the 1999 European Parliament election the Greens were reduced to 1.8% and two MEPs , prompting the resignation of Luigi Manconi , who had led the party since 1996 . The party was thus re-organised under Grazia Francescato , a former president of the Italys section of the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) .",
      "At the 2001 general election the Greens formed a joint list with the Italian Democratic Socialists ( SDI ) : The Sunflower . The combination scored 2.2% , thus failing to surpass the 4% threshold . The Greens elected seven deputies and ten senators in single-member constituencies , as part of The Olive Tree coalition .",
      "Shift to the far left .",
      "After the alliance with the SDI , a relatively centrist party , the Greens shifted far to the left , prompting the exit of leading members as Ronchi , Mattioli , Scalia , Corleone and Manconi . The Greens were since part of the so-called radical left , along with the Communist Refoundation Party ( PRC ) and the Party of Italian Communists ( PdCI ) .",
      "At the 2004 European Parliament election the Greens obtained 2.5% of the vote and two MEPs .",
      "In February 2005 the Greens joined The Union , the new successor alliance to The Olive Tree , with party secretary Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio receiving 2.2% of the vote in the open primary election for the coalitions leader . At the 2006 general election the party was part of the winning coalition The Union , and scored 2.1% , obtained 15 seats in the Chamber of Deputies . The Together with the Union list , an alliance of Greens , Communists and Consumers polled 4.2% in the election for the Senate , electing 11 senators , 5 of whom were Greens . In 2006\u20132008 Pecoraro Scanio served as minister of the Environment , while Paolo Cento , national coordinator of the party and leader of the no global faction , was undersecretary of Economy and Finances .",
      "In November 2006 Pecoraro Scanios political line was confirmed in a party congress , but the Greens also tried to re-open the doors to all former members . The attempt of re-uniting the Italian Greens failed as soon as in January 2007 , when Mattioli , Scalia and Corleone finally left the party again , citing that it was drifting too much the far left , and announced their intention to participate to the foundation of the Democratic Party ( PD ) . Within the PD , they joined the Democratic Ecologists faction , which already included several former Greens ( Manconi , Ronchi , Lino De Benetti , Stefano Semenzato , Ermete Realacci , Gianni Vernetti , Franco Piro , Francesco Ferrante , Carla Rocchi , etc. ) . As a result , Legambiente , the largest environmentalist association of Italy , showed more support for the PD than the Greens themselves .",
      "Out of Parliament .",
      "In the run-up of the 2008 general election , the Greens participated in the foundation of The Left \u2013 The Rainbow electoral list with the PRC , the PdCI and Democratic Left ( SD ) . The coalition obtained just 3.1% of the vote and the Greens lost their parliamentary representation .",
      "In the summer of 2008 Grazia Francescato , who had been leader before , represented the partys establishment and in the event was supported by Centos left-wing , was elected at the helm of the party , by defeating two modernizers , Marco Boato and Fabio Roggiolani .",
      "For the 2009 election the Greens formed a joint list with the Movement for the Left ( MpS ) \u2013 a moderate split from the PRC \u2013 , the Socialist Party ( PS ) \u2013 successor of the SDI \u2013 , SD and Unite the Left ( UlS ) : Left and Freedom ( SL ) . The list received just 3.1% of the vote and failed to return any MEPs . After the election , it was decided to transform SL into a permanent federation , that would eventually evolve into the joint party named Left Ecology Freedom ( SEL ) , and Francescato wanted the Greens to join it .",
      "However , during a party congress in October 2009 the party rejected the proposal by narrowly electing Angelo Bonelli , candidate of the liberal faction led by Boato , instead of Francescatos candidate , Loredana De Petris . After his election , which marked the end of the dominance of the internal left wing over the party , Bonelli announced that the party will pursue an independent course from SL , and will try to coalesce a new ecologist constituent assembly on the model of the French Europe \u00c9cologie . Francescato , De Petris and Cento continued to support SL as the Ecologists Association and would eventually leave the Greens .",
      "New coalitions .",
      "In September 2010 the Greens launched a Ecologist Constituent Assembly . In Bonellis view the new political force would take inspiration both from the French Verts and the German Gr\u00fcnen and would be open to the contribution of movements and associations , notably including Beppe Grillos Five Star Movement ( M5S ) . Other than the Greens , participants of the new political force included , among others , Massimo Scalia ( a former leading Green ) , Bruno Mellano ( president of the Italian Radicals ) , movie maker Mario Monicelli , writer Dacia Maraini , geologist Mario Tozzi and comedian Giobbe Covatta . As a result , in November 2011 the Ecologists and Civic Networks ( Ecologisti e Reti Civiche , ERC ) coalition was officially launched , but it would be just a short-lived experiment .",
      "In 2012 Bonelli stood as candidate for mayor of Taranto , garnering 11.9% of the vote .",
      "In the 2013 general election the Greens were part of the Civil Revolution coalition , which obtained a mere 2.2% of the vote and no seats . In May the ERC was disbanded and in November , during a party congress , Luana Zanella was elected to serve as co-spokesperson along with Bonelli .",
      "The Greens contested the 2014 European Parliament election with Green Italy ( GI ) , a green party established in 2013 and led by Monica Frassoni and Fabio Granata , within the joint list Green Italy \u2013 European Greens . The electoral list received 0.9% of the vote and did not return any MEPs .",
      "In January 2015 senator Bartolomeo Pepe , a former member of the M5S , joined the party , giving it parliamentary representation after seven years . In June another former senator of the M5S , Paola De Pin , joined the Greens and sat with senator Pepe within the Great Autonomies and Freedom group . Both Pepe and De Pin would soon leave the party . Another former M5S senator , Cristina De Pietro , would join the Greens in November 2016 and leave next year .",
      "In November 2015 , during a party congress , Covatta was elected spokesperson , succeeding to Bonelli and Zanella . However , Covattas role was soon transformed into that of a testimonial . In February 2017 the party appointed Bonelli and Fiorella Zabatta to serve as day-to-day coordinators and Zanella as international secretary . Later that year , the coordinators were three : Bonelli , Zanella and , representing the partys minority , Gianluca Carrabs .",
      "Return to the centre-left .",
      "In December 2017 , in an internal referendum , 73% of Green members voted in favour of their partys return to the moderate centre-left coalition led by the PD . Consequently , the Greens formed , along with the Italian Socialist Party and Civic Area , the Together electoral list for the 2018 general election . When the results came in , the list had obtained a mere 0.6% of the vote and no seats ; additionally , no Green was elected in single-seat constituencies . After the election , Bonelli resigned from the executive and the remaining two coordinators , Zanella and Carrabs , led the transition .",
      "In December 2018 , during a party congress , Matteo Badiali and Elena Grandi , supported by Bonelli and Zanella , were elected co-spokespersons of the party .",
      "In the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament election the party formed a joint list with Italy in Common ( IiC ) and GI . The alliance was reinforced by Marco Affronte , who had been elected with the M5S in 2014 and had joined as an independent the Greens\u2013European Free Alliance group and the European Green Party , and eventually announced on Facebook that he had joined the FdV . However , IiC soon left the Greens in order to form an alternative alliance with More Europe , a liberal party . The list received 2.3% of the vote , quite an improvement from 2014 , but still not enough to exceed the 4% threshold .",
      "In the 2020 Italian regional elections a re-edition of Green Europe won seats in Emilia-Romagna , Veneto , Marche and Campania . Together with the seat won in Trentino in 2018 , the Greens had a total of 5 seats in Regional Councils , their best result in terms of representation in a decade .",
      "In March 2021 Rossella Muroni ( GI ) left the Free and Equal group in order to establish , along with Lorenzo Fioramonti ( GI , former M5S ) , Alessandro Fusacchia ( Italian Radicals , former +Eu ) , Andrea Cecconi ( ex-M5S ) and Antonio Lombardo ( ex-M5S ) , a sub-group of the FdV within the Mixed Group instead .",
      "Popular support .",
      "In their history the Greens were never able to reach the electoral success of many green parties all around Europe . They have a stable share of vote around 2% and experienced a slight decline in the last decade . Their characterization as party of the far left did not help them in Northern Italy , where they had their best results at the beginning ( for instance 7.1% in the 1990 Venetian regional election ) .",
      "The Greens are stronger in cities and urban areas ( Milan , Venice , Rome , Naples , etc. ) , in northern mountain regions , such as Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol ( especially in South Tyrol , where they are organised in the local Greens , a broader left-wing party ) and Aosta Valley ( where the local section , the Alternative Greens , were merged into Autonomy Liberty Participation Ecology in 2010 ) , and in some southern regions , such as Basilicata and Campania .",
      "Leadership .",
      "The party was successively led by spokespersons , presidents and coordinators . Bold indicates the real leader/s of the time .",

      "ACES ( Spanish acronym : Aerol\u00edneas Centrales de Colombia ) was an airline with its headquarters in the Edificio del Cafe in Medell\u00edn , Colombia and founded on August 30 , 1971 , by a group of 13 Colombian entrepreneurs , amongst them , most notably Orlando Botero Escobar and German Pe\u00f1aloza Arias from Manizales and Luis H . Coulson , Jorge Coulson R. , Alberto Jaramillo and Hern\u00e1n Zuluaga from Medell\u00edn .",
      "History .",
      "Mr . Botero and Mr . Pe\u00f1aloza , were considered pioneers in the early days of Colombian commercial aviation , had tried several times to establish a commuter service between Manizales and Bogot\u00e1 . They managed to operate a small commuter airline by the name TARCA ( acronym of Taxi A\u00e9reo de Caldas ) , which was forced to shut down due to financial difficulties . With the support and capital of the new partners from Medell\u00edn , they embarked on the successful enterprise that would be ACES . The airline began service in 1972 with Saunders ST-27 aircraft for the routes Medell\u00edn-Bogot\u00e1 and Manizales-Bogot\u00e1 , and soon became a major player in the Colombian market . By 1976 , the airline had expanded its network to smaller regional destinations , for which it purchased DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft .",
      "In 1981 , it acquired its first Boeing 727-100 . In 1986 , an expansion began with the acquisition of more 727-100 and the arrival of Fairchild FH-227 aircraft built under license by Fairchild in the United States and with slight modifications . The 727s had a capacity of 129 passengers and the Fairchilds of 44 . At this time the first international charter flights also began to Havana , Varadero , Nassau , Freeport , Montego Bay , Puerto Plata , Punta Cana , St . Kitts , St . Maarten , Porlamar and Cancun .",
      "In 1991 , ACES completely replaced its Fokker F27 Friendship fleet with ATR 42 turbo-prop aircraft for its short-haul regional routes , and its Boeing 727-100 with the Boeing 727-200 Advanced variant . In 1992 , ACES expanded its service internationally , operating flights from Medell\u00edn and Bogot\u00e1 to Miami . Soon after , Juan Emilio Posada was appointed CEO and would serve until the airlines demise in 2003 . In the late 1997 , ACES modernized its fleet acquiring brand-new Airbus A320-200 aircraft that replaced its Boeing 727s . It expanded its routes to Fort Lauderdale , Quito , Caracas , Canc\u00fan ( served by charters ) , Santo Domingo , Punta Cana and San Juan , Puerto Rico ; as well as additional domestic flights within Colombia .",
      "ACES created a corporate culture of service and punctuality that would earn it the recognition and loyalty of its customers , resulting in consistent increases in its market share and revenues in the domestic market , which was dominated for decades by Avianca . It was named the Best airline in Colombia by several industry and consumer publications .",
      "On May 20 , 2002 , ACES merged with major competitor Avianca and SAM to form the Alianza Summa , a strategic alliance aimed at joining forces to counteract the adverse circumstances that faced the airline industry in Colombia and the world after the September 11 attacks . ACES operations were halted on August 20 , 2003 , after the boards decision to liquidate the airline . ACES ceased operations on October 24 , 2003 after liquidating . By November 2003 , the Summa Alliance was dissolved and ACES routes taken over by Avianca .",

      "Levski Sofia ( ) is a Bulgarian professional association football club based in Sofia , which competes in the First League , the top division of the Bulgarian football league system . The club was founded on 24 May 1914 as a football department of Levski Sofia sports club by a group of students , and is named after Vasil Levski , a Bulgarian revolutionary renowned as the national hero of the country .",
      "Levski has won a total of 73 trophies , including 26 national titles , 25 national cups and 3 supercups , as well as 13 domestic Doubles and 1 Treble . It is also the only Bulgarian football club to have never been relegated from the top division since the establishment of the league system in 1937 . Levski has reached the quarter-finals of UEFA competitions for five times , was runner-up of the Balkans Cup twice , and in 2006 , it became the first Bulgarian club to enter the group stage of the UEFA Champions League .",
      "The teams regular kit colour is all-blue . Levskis home ground is the Vivacom Arena - Georgi Asparuhov in Sofia , which has a capacity of 25,000 spectators . The clubs biggest rivals are CSKA Sofia , and matches between the two capital sides are commonly referred to as the Eternal derby of Bulgaria . Levski is also a regular member of the European Club Association and the European Multisport Club Association .",
      "History .",
      "Sport Club Levski ( 1914\u20131969 ) .",
      "Sport Club Levski was founded in 1911 by a group of secondary school students in Sofia . The clubs name was chosen in honour of the Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski , and the club was officially registered on 24 May 1914 .",
      "In 1914 , Levski lost its first official match against FC 13 Sofia with the score 2\u20130 . Between 1914 and 1920 , football wasnt a popular sport in Bulgaria , and no additional information about the club exists . In the summer of 1921 , the Sofia Sports League was established , which united ten clubs from Sofia and marked the beginning of organized football competitions in the city . Levski won the first match in the championship in the 1921\u201322 season , held on 18 September 1921 , against Athletic Sofia with the score of 3\u20131 . The team captured first place in the league in 1923 after a 3\u20132 win over bitter rivals Slavia Sofia , and successfully defended the title the following season .",
      "The first National Championship was held in 1924 with Levski representing Sofia . The team went on to win the title in 1933 , 1937 and 1942 , and established itself as the most popular football club in Bulgaria . In 1929 , Levski became the first semi-professional football club in Bulgaria , after twelve players staged a boycott of the team in demand of financial remuneration and insurance benefits . The same year Levski met its first international opponents , losing to Gallipoli Istanbul 1\u20130 and winning against Kuban Istanbul 6\u20130 . Between 1930 and 1932 , Levski won the Ulpia Serdica Cup for three consecutive years and was permanently awarded the trophy as a result .",
      "After World War II , Levski became one of the two top clubs in Bulgaria . After winning the championship in 1946 , 1947 , 1949 , 1950 and 1953 , Levski would not capture the domestic title again until the mid-1960s . In 1949 , the authorities changed the clubs name to Dinamo following the Soviet traditions , but after the de-Stalinization of Bulgaria , it was reverted in 1957 . The 1960s were marked with return to success both on the domestic and on the international stage . Levskis academy would become the most successful in national youth competitions for the years to come , and the results were first seen in the likes of Georgi Asparuhov , Georgi Sokolov , Biser Mihaylov , Kiril Ivkov , Ivan Vutsov , Stefan Aladzhov and Aleksandar Kostov , assisted by experienced veterans like Stefan Abadzhiev , Dimo Pechenikov and Hristo Iliev , which resulted in winning the championship in 1965 , 1968 and 1970 , including the 7\u20132 triumph over new bitter rivals CSKA Sofia in 1968 . In the 1965\u201366 European Cup , Levski was eliminated in the first round by Benfica with 5\u20134 on aggregate .",
      "Levski-Spartak ( 1969\u20131985 ) .",
      "In January 1969 , Levski was forcibly merged with Spartak Sofia by the Bulgarian Communist Party , and put under the auspice of the Ministry of Interior Affairs . The name of the club was once again changed , this time to Levski-Spartak .",
      "A new crop of youngsters in the likes of Kiril Milanov , Dobromir Zhechev , Pavel Panov , Yordan Yordanov , Stefan Staykov , Tomas Lafchis , Todor Barzov , Voyn Voynov , Georgi Tsvetkov , Plamen Nikolov , and Rusi Gochev not only found their place in the first team , but brought new league titles in 1974 , 1977 , 1979 , 1984 and 1985 . On the international stage , the team reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners Cup in 1969\u201370 and 1976\u201377 , and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in 1975\u201376 . In the latter , Levski defeated Barcelona 5\u20134 in the second leg , becoming one of the two European teams ( the other being Bayern Munich ) to have scored five or more goals in one match against Barcelona in official UEFA competitions . Additionally , Levski became the only Bulgarian club to eliminate a German champion after defeating VfB Stuttgart in the first round of the 1984\u201385 European Cup . They also eliminated Stuttgart a year earlier in the first round of the 1983\u201384 UEFA Cup .",
      "Vitosha Sofia ( 1985\u20131989 ) .",
      "The name of the team was changed to Vitosha by the authorities following the disruptions during and after the Bulgarian Cup final in 1985 . The game ran on high emotions fuelled by the streak of consecutive victories of Levski over CSKA in the two years prior to the game . During the game , which CSKA won 2\u20131 , there were confrontations both on the field and on the stands . By decree of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party , some of the leading players of both clubs were suspended from the sport for life . The championship title of the club for 1985 was suspended . However , the suspensions were lifted shortly after . Levski won another cup and league titles in 1986 and 1988 , respectively . The fourth European quarter-final came in 1986\u201387 , when Levski knocked out the 1985\u201386 Danish Cup winners Boldklubben 1903 and the 1985\u201386 Yugoslav Cup holders Vele\u017e Mostar , before losing to the 1985\u201386 Copa del Rey winners Real Zaragoza .",
      "Levski Sofia ( 1989\u20132009 ) .",
      "After the 1989\u201390 season , the club regained its original name . The team was made up of players such as Plamen Nikolov , Petar Hubchev , Tsanko Tsvetanov , Emil Kremenliev , Zlatko Yankov , Georgi Slavchev , Ilian Iliev , Daniel Borimirov , Stanimir Stoilov , Velko Yotov , Plamen Getov , Nikolay Todorov and Nasko Sirakov , and won three consecutive domestic national championships in 1993 , 1994 and 1995 . Levski contributed seven players ( Tsvetanov , Kremenliev , Yankov , Sirakov , Nikolov , Petar Aleksandrov and Borimirov ) , more than any other Bulgarian team , to the Bulgaria national football team that finished in fourth place at the 1994 FIFA World Cup .",
      "In 2005\u201306 , Levski reached the quarter-finals of the 2005\u201306 UEFA Cup after knocking out the 2004\u201305 Coupe de France winners Auxerre in the first round , finishing above SC Heerenveen , Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti and the reigning title holders CSKA Moscow in the group stage , triumphing over Champions League participants Artmedia Bratislava and Udinese in the knockout stages , before being eliminated by Schalke 04 .",
      "Levski , as the champions of Bulgaria , started their 2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League participation in the second qualiftying round , where they eliminated Georgian champions Sioni Bolnisi , defeating them 2\u20130 both home and away . In the third round , Levski faced Italian team Chievo Verona , which took part in the tournament because of other clubs sanctions as part of the 2006 Serie A matchfixing scandal . Levski eliminated Chievo after a decisive 2\u20130 win in Sofia and a 2\u20132 draw in Verona , and thus became the first Bulgarian club to ever reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League . There , they faced the title holders Barcelona , Premier League champions Chelsea , and Werder Bremen . They lost all six games and scored only one goal , in the second round against Chelsea .",
      "Levski earned a place in the 2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League after the Bulgarian league champions CSKA Sofia failed to obtain a UEFA license . Levski lost to BATE Borisov of Belarus in the third qualifying round .",
      "Levski Sofia ( 2009\u2013present ) .",
      "During the 2009\u201310 season , Levskis team started their European campaign with a 9\u20130 ( on aggregate ) win against UE Sant Juli\u00e0 in the second qualifying round of the 2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League . In the next round , Levski Sofia faced FK Baku , eliminating the team from Azerbaijan with 2\u20130 on aggregate . In the play-off round , Levski was eliminated by Debrecen with 4\u20131 on aggregate . As one of the play-off losers , Levski qualified for the 2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League . In the group stage , Levski faced Villarreal , Lazio and Red Bull Salzburg . Levski achieved only one win and five defeats . Levski took the win against Lazio in Italy , after Hristo Yovov scored the winning goal in the match .",
      "Levski started the 2010\u201311 season with a match against Dundalk , in a second qualifying round of the 2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League . Levski won the first match 6\u20130 . In the return leg at Oriel Park , Levski defeated Dundalk 2\u20130 with two first half goals from Garra Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 , the first in the fourth minute and the second ten minutes before the half-time . In the next round Levski played against Kalmar FF . The first match ended 1\u20131 in Sweden . In the return leg in Sofia , Levski won 5\u20132 . In between , The Blues defeated their archrival CSKA Sofia in the Eternal derby with 1\u20130 . Their next match in the Europa League saw them play against AIK Fotboll from Stockholm , Sweden . The first match ended in a goalless draw , and after the game , AIK hooligans attacked the Levski players and staff . The second match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Levski . Goals scored by Daniel Mladenov and Garra Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 put Levski in the Europa League group stage . Levski was drawn in Group C , facing Gent , Lille and Sporting CP . The first match was played against Gent at home , which Levski won 3\u20132 with the winning goal scored by Serginho Greene . With this win , Levski recorded eight consecutive games without a defeat in European competitions . After that , Levski lost to Sporting CP with 5\u20130 , followed by another defeat against Lille . In Sofia , Levski played well against Lille and was leading 2\u20131 until Ivo Ivanov scored an own goal to make it 2\u20132 . In the last match of the Group C , Levski took a win against Sporting CP with 1\u20130 , with the winning goal scored by Daniel Mladenov .",
      "In the following 2011\u201312 season , in the third qualifying round of the Europa League , Levski were eliminated by Spartak Trnava of Slovakia , following a late game 2\u20131 win in Sofia , and a loss of the same scoreline in Trnava . The penalty shoot-out costed Levski a place in the play-off round . This caused an upset with the fans and players , and the team barely clinched the fourth place at the winter break in the Bulgarian league . Albeit only three points from the leaders Ludogoretz Razgrad , the acting manager Georgi Ivanov was sacked from the position , but remained at the club as a sporting director . Nikolay Kostov was appointed the new manager of the club , giving the supporters a sense of optimism , which , however , faded after a cup knock-out in the hands of Lokomotiv Plovdiv and a home defeat to Minyor Pernik . Kostov handed in his resignation , leaving the managerial post once again vacant . Sporting director Georgi Ivanov once again stepped in to help the club , and accepted being the manager until the summer break , when a new one would be appointed .",
      "During the summer of 2012 , former player Ilian Iliev was appointed the new manager of the club . Under his management , Levski was knocked out from the Europa League by Bosnian side FK Sarajevo . Iliev led the team to 13 league victories and to the semi-finals of the Bulgarian Cup after eliminating Cherno More Varna and Litex Lovech on the away goals rule . Iliev however was sacked after a 1\u20131 away draw against Pirin Gotse Delchev . Assistant manager Nikolay Mitov took over the team until the end of the season . Under his management Levski won the derby clashes against Litex , CSKA and Ludogorets but failed to win the title after a 1\u20131 home draw against Slavia Sofia . Levski also reached their first Bulgarian Cup final since 2007 , but lost on penalties against Beroe Stara Zagora . Despite the missed opportunity of winning a trophy , Mitovs contract was renewed for the 2013\u201314 season . However , the team made another disappointing performance in Europa League , being eliminated by the Kazakh side Irtysh Pavlodar . As a result , Nikolay Mitov resigned as manager .",
      "In July 2013 Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107 was appointed as the new manager of the team . Despite losing only two matches in twelve games , Jokanovi\u0107 was released in October 2013 . Ivaylo Petev was announced as his successor but during his introduction a few Levski supporters interrupted it , stating that they would not accept his appointment . The next day , Petev refused to take charge of the team and Antoni Zdravkov was named as the new manager . Under his reign the team suffered a heavy 3\u20130 loss against rivals CSKA , but managed to knock them out in the Bulgarian Cup in December 2013 after penalties . Due to the difficult financial situation , a few key players , such as Antonio Vutov and Garry Rodrigues , were sold to Udinese and Elche , respectively , during the winter break . This reflected on the teams performance and Levski finished fifth and got knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Bulgarian Cup by Botev Plovdiv . Antoni Zdravkov was sacked in March 2014 , and Levski legend Elin Topuzakov took charge as a caretaker until the end of the 2013\u201314 season . For the first time since 1990\u201391 the club did not participate in European competitions .",
      "On 23 May 2014 , the club supporters organized a friendly game against Lazio , marking the 100th anniversary of the club . Club icons like Georgi Ivanov , Dimitar Ivankov , Aleksandar Aleksandrov , Hristo Yovov , Elin Topuzakov and many other former players and celebrities took participation by playing in the game , as well as donating money for the events organization . The next day , Levski marked 100 years since its founding . As of 2020 , the results from a decade of incompetent management have finally come out , putting the club in a financial crisis and on the verge of bankruptcy . In the summer of 2020 , club legend Nasko Sirakov took charge of the majority of shares and the club made some financial cuts , forcing a big part of the players ( mainly foreigners ) to leave . Levski also changed its transfer policy , signing mainly Bulgarian and homegrown players with lower salaries , allowing the club to start paying off some of the debt accumulated throughout the years . Sirakov set a target for the club to clear most of the debt by 2023 , mostly through sponsorship deals , outgoing transfers , television rights and the fans financial support .",

      "The first club crest was designed by Mincho Kachulev in 1922 . Initially in the size of a square with a blue background , it was intentionally written in a stylized letter \u041b ( Bulgarian letter L ; shortened for Levski ) . The inner space of the letter was filled vertically equally in yellow and red colours . In a later period of time , the Cyrillic letters \u0421 ( Sport ) and \u041a ( club ) were added at the top of the square , while the bottom side was inscribed with the name Sofia . This badge was used by the club until 1949 , when it was renamed to Dinamo .",
      "From 1949 to 1956 , the emblem of the club was an irregular hexagon filled with vertical red , white , blue and yellow colours , with an inscribed handwritten Cyrillic letter \u0414 , alongside a five-pointed red star above it and the word Sofia underneath .",
      "From 1957 to 1968 the original logo of the club was restored , however the letters C and \u041a were replaced with \u0424 ( Athletic ) and \u0414 ( union ) .",
      "After the merger with Spartak Sofia in 1969 , the club crest has been a shield in blue and white with a horizontal red bar above . The shield spawned the letters \u041b and C , an abbreviation of the new name Levski-Spartak . The football club used this crest until 1985 , when it was renamed Vitosha . Vitoshas crest was in the form of a stylized letter C surrounding the football in the upper curve of the letter , coloured in blue and white .",
      "In January 1990 , the club restored its original name and original logo , and the letters C and K in the upper corner of the blue square were replaced with the initials \u0424 ( football ) and K ( club ) . However , due to legal issues with the ownership of the rights to the historic crest , the club was forced to change it in 1998 , when a brand new shield logo was introduced , entirely in blue . At its centre , an inscription of the letter \u041b was introduced , alongside the year of establishment \u2013 1914 . The dome of the shield was labelled PFC Levski .",
      "After winning the legal dispute for the rights to the historic emblem in 2006 , the club decided to use the two different logos simultaneously for a brief period of time . Later that year , the shield crest was completely removed and the classic square emblem has been used since .",

      "The Washington Spirit is an American professional soccer club based in the Washington , D.C . metropolitan area that participates in the National Womens Soccer League ( NWSL ) . It is a continuation of the D.C . United Women of the W-League and continues to field both an amateur WPSL team and a youth team , both under the Spirit name . The Spirit is coached by Richie Burke .",
      "History .",
      "Establishment .",
      "The foundation of the National Womens Soccer League was announced on November 21 , 2012 , with Washington selected as a host for one of the eight teams selected for the inaugural season . In December 2012 , the teams name was announced as the Washington Spirit . D.C . United Women head coach Mike Jorden was kept on as well as assistant coach Cindi Harkes . Harkes is married to the former U.S . international and D.C . United star John Harkes . Bill Lynch , the original Washington Spirits owner when the National Womens Soccer League launched in 2013 , sold the majority of the team to tech executive Steve Baldwin in late 2018 . Several other minority investors have since been added to the ownership group\u2014Jenna Bush Hager and Chelsea Clinton , daughters of U.S . presidents ; Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Dominique Dawes ; and most recently ( May 2021 ) Washington Capitals star Alexander Ovechkin .",
      "Inaugural season .",
      "On January 11 , 2013 as part of the NWSL Player Allocation , goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris ( USA ) , defender Ali Krieger ( USA ) , midfielder Lori Lindsey ( USA ) , defender Robyn Gayle ( CAN ) , midfielder Diana Matheson ( CAN ) , defender Alina Garciamendez ( MEX ) and midfielder Teresa Worbis ( MEX ) were named to the team . During the February 7 , 2013 NWSL Supplemental Draft , the team selected Stephanie Ochs , Tori Huster , Jordan Angeli , Natasha Kai , Megan Mischler and Heather Cooke .",
      "The Spirit played their first competitive match on April 14 , 2013 , drawing Boston Breakers 1\u20131 with Tiffany McCarty scoring the teams first goal assisted by Stephanie Ochs .",
      "The inaugural season saw the Spirit stumble out of the gate under Mike Jorden , who was fired after the first eleven games having won only once in that time . Jorden was replaced by Mark Parsons , who finished the season in 8th ( last ) place registering only 2 more wins over the season .",
      "2014\u20132016 successes .",
      "After a poor inaugural season , the Spirit would much improve in the 2014 making some key acquisitions including Jodie Taylor and Christine Nairn , both who would finish as the teams tops scorers with 11 and 8 goals , respectively . Finishing 4th , the Spirit made their first NWSL Playoff appearance . They would lose at Seattle Reign .",
      "The Spirit finished the 2015 season with a record of 8\u20136\u20136 and repeating their 4th place league position . The playoff result , again , ended in an away loss to Seattle in the semifinals . The season would be the breakout year for Crystal Dunn who was awarded the 2015 NWSL Golden Boot Award , scoring 15 goals during the campaign . At the conclusion of the season , Mark Parsons stepped down as head coach and general manager to take over as coach of the Portland Thorns FC .",
      "Building off the successes of the 2014 and 2015 seasons , the Spirit hired former Sky Blue FC manager , Jim Gabarra ahead of the 2016 season . The Spirit had their most successful season to date in 2016 , being league leaders in the standings throughout most of the season . Only in the final week would the Spirits loss finalize them as league runners-up . Earning their first post-season victory against Chicago Red Stars , the Spirit would lose the 2016 NWSL Final in penalties to Western New York Flash .",
      "2017\u2013present .",
      "In the aftermath of finishing 2016 runners-up , the Spirit saw a series of key departures including captain Ali Krieger ( traded to Orlando Pride ) , Christine Nairn and Diana Matheson ( both traded to Seattle Reign ) , and Crystal Dunn leaving for Chelsea , while retaining her contracting rights . Unable to adequately replace these players , the Spirit struggled to compete throughout the 2017 season ultimately finishing last ( 10th ) for the first time since the inaugural season . However , building for the future , Gabarra was able to recruit U.S . national team prospect , Mallory Pugh mid-season . Pugh would go on to lead the team in scoring , registering 6 goals in 16 games .",
      "The 2018 season continued the Spirits pursuit of young talent , but also continued the struggle for results . On August 21 , after eight straight losses and being eliminated from playoff contention , the Spirit fired head coach , Jim Gabarra , and appointed assistant coach , Tom Torres as interim head coach . Torres lead the Spirit through the final three matches of the season at home , including the Spirits debut at newly opened Audi Field against Portland Thorns on August 25 . The match set a new club record for home attendance with 7,976 fans . The season ended with the Spirit finishing in 8th place , just ahead of Sky Blue FC . During the offseason , the Spirit appointed Richie Burke as the new head coach while retaining Tom Torres on the technical staff . The announcement also noted local tech executive Steve Baldwin had become the Spirits new majority owner .",
      "The 2019 Washington Spirit season marked several changes for the Spirit organization . Owner Steve Baldwin outlined several improvements including an upgraded player experience , theme nights for fans , a gear store in the stadium , and a mascot . The 2019 season also featured major changes on the field ; fifteen new players were added to the Spirit roster including Australian national team members Chloe Logarzo and Amy Harrison . The Spirit surpassed their point total from the previous season on May 18 after the 5th game of the season against Portland Thorns FC . They would go on to surpass their past seasons point total the next week against the Chicago Red Stars . They ultimately finished 5th in the 2019 NWSL standings .",
      "Colors and badge .",
      "In January 2013 , the team unveiled its new colors and badge . The badge was designed to resemble a torch reflecting the notion of Burning with Spirit . It also contains a crown that holds 11 stars to represent the 11 players on the field and a ball with a single star to represent the 12th player ( the teams fans ) placed where the fuel for the torch would be representing how the fans fuel the spirit . All of the components of the badge are wrapped in the Banner of Spirit for a patriotic theme honoring our flag and all of those who have given their lives and sacrificed much so we can enjoy the freedoms we have .",
      "The logo was designed by freelance designer Pete Schwadel and incorporates the team colors of navy , red , and white , further reinforcing the patriotic theme woven throughout the teams imagery . It also features both Washington and DC to represent the teams connection with the District and the greater Washington metropolitan area .",
      "Stadium .",
      "The Maryland SoccerPlex , located in Germantown , Maryland , was home to the Washington Spirit beginning with the inaugural 2013 season . The facility was also home to the Washington Spirit Reserves in the WPSL .",
      "Starting during the 2018 season , the Spirit began coordinating with D.C . United to play home matches at Audi Field in Buzzard Point in Washington D.C . The Spirit played their first match on August 25 that season , hosting the Portland Thorns FC . The match registered the teams highest attended game and was viewed as a means to generate more interest in the team . During the 2019 season , the team announced it would host two home matches at Audi Field .",
      "On November 12 , 2019 , the team announced that in the 2020 season , the Spirit reached an agreement with D.C . United that will split the teams home games between three stadiums , the Maryland SoccerPlex , Audi Field and Segra Field in Leesburg , Virginia for four games each . Due to COVID restrictions , the Spirit played two home matches at Segra Field in 2020 . Starting in 2021 , the Spirit will play all its home regular-season games at Audi Field and Segra Field , although the club still planned to hold at least one preseason game a year at the SoccerPlex after 2020 .",
      "In addition , the team has relocated its training facilities to Segra Field and will occupy the new D.C . United training center in Leesburg once the facility is completed in the summer of 2021 .",
      "Supporters .",
      "The Spirit Squadron is the name of the supporters group for the Spirit . The group was started by friends Ashley Nichols , Megan Wesson and Tory Johnson . Of the groups founding , Nichols said , .. . with a new league we needed to show the team as much support as possible because we really want a womens pro league to stay here in the United States . So between that and wanting to also provide a fun experience for fans , we decided to create the Spirit Squadron .",
      "In February 2021 , The Washington Post reported that Chelsea Clinton , Jenna Bush Hager , Dominique Dawes and Brianna Scurry were part of an investment group investing in the team .",
      "Broadcasting .",
      "At the beginning of the 2019 season the Spirit announced a broadcast partnership with NBC Sports Washington and Monumental Sports Network .",
      "As of April 2017 , Washington Spirit games are streamed exclusively by Go90 for American audiences and via the NWSL website for international viewers . For the 2017 season , the Spirit will be featured in three nationally televised Lifetime NWSL Game of the Week broadcasts on April 22 , June 17 , and August 19 , 2017 .",
      "In 2016 , the Spirits NWSL Playoff game against the Chicago Red Stars was broadcast on Fox Sports 1 and was available for streaming on the companys online streaming platform , Fox Sports Go ."

      "Lykkehjulet",
      "Lykkehjulet is the Danish version of the Wheel of Fortune television game show . Airing in 1988 , the show was the first big American game show to be imported to Denmark and it was one of the first successes for Danish broadcaster TV2 when it became Denmarks second TV channel in 1988 .",
      "The show originally used the shopping format of the American program in which winnings were used to buy studios prizes , such as furniture , appliances , and trips . In later years the format was changed to reflect the American version of all-cash winnings . The host during the first season was Michael Meyerheim with Pia Dresner as the letter-turning co-host . Thereafter , the show was hosted by Bengt Burg from 1989 to 2000 , with a short stint by Keld Heick during the 1996-1997 season . The final season in 2001 season was hosted by Lars Herlow . The letter-turning co-hosts were Carina Jensen ( 1989\u20131994 ) and Maria Hirse ( 1995\u20132001 ) . The shows announcers during the run of the program were Ole Jacobsen , then Henrik Hannibal and later , Dennis Johannesson . The show ran for 3,599 episodes until it was cancelled in 2001 due to declining viewership and a failed attempt at modernizing the format in the final year .",
      "Unique to the Danish version .",
      "There were several details which were unique to the Danish version of Wheel of Fortune .",
      "- Theme song",
      "The opening theme to the program was an original composition composed by Jesper Ranum .",
      "- The wheel and podiums",
      "The multi-colored wheel had 22 wedges ( each with 4 pegs ) instead of the 24 wedges of the American show , and value amounts originally ranged from 100 to 1,500 kroner ( 2,500 starting in round 2 in 1989 ) to be used for shopping purposes . The podiums followed a blue-red-yellow pattern , as it did for several other foreign adaptions .",
      "Beginning in 1990 , the top value was 3,000 kr . in Round 1 then 5,000 kr . from Round 2 onwards . By 1999 , the top value was 5,000 kr . in every round . In 1999 , the Fallit/10,000/Fallit wedge would be placed on the wheel in the third round with the 10,000 section being treated as a regular space . In 2001 , the top values were 2,500 points in round one , 7,500 in rounds two and three and 10,000 between two garbage cans in round four . The winner of each round kept their points and chose one of two prizes .",
      "- Vowels",
      "Vowels cost 500 kr . and were to be purchased prior to spinning the wheel .",
      "- The Free Spin",
      "Known as an Ekstra Tur , ( Joker in 1988 ) it was originally conceived like the US Free Spin , where it was an entire wedge on the wheel , and multiple Free Spins could be won . It eventually became a single token placed on the wheel . After landing on the space with the token , the player automatically picked it up and called for a letter to win the hidden amount beneath the token ( usually 600 kroner ) .",
      "- Bonus round",
      "In the bonus round , the player must choose five consonants and a vowel and solve the puzzle within 15 seconds . At first , the player chose which prize to play for . By 1996 , the player chose one of three round envelopes , each concealing one of three bonus prizes .",
      "- Puzzleboard and sound effects",
      "The letters on the puzzleboard were the traditional trilon shape for the first twelve years of the program . In 2001 , the puzzleboard was changed to an electronic form . The bell indicating a correct letter had a high D-note pitch to it ( similar to the sound effect used on the American version when a bonus envelope is taken ) , while the horn for a wrong guess or a Tabt Tur ( Lose A Turn ) was borrowed from the US version of The Price is Right , and a downward whistle for Fallit ( bankrupt ) making a player lose all of their money and losing their turn .",
      "2001 was also the first and only year the show introduced a video wall behind the contestants , but at that point , the puzzleboard still used trilons .",
      "2018 revival .",
      "In October 2018 , the series returned on TV2 . The set , though modernized and simplified , has a look that is somewhat reminiscent of the original 1988 set . The original theme and several of the original sound effects are also used , some of them with a few touch-ups . Interestingly , the puzzle board uses the same dimensions as the original puzzle board rather than the current American dimension , although it is now electronic . It was hosted by Mikkel Kryger and co-hosted by Stephania Potalivo .",
      "The format is also similar to the original version . Vowels still cost KR500 and the shopping format has also returned . KR1,500 is the top value in Round 1 , KR2,500 in Round 2 , and Kr5,000 in Round 3 . Another KR5,000 space is added in Round 4 . A Gevinst token ( represented by a picture of a star ) is added in Round 2 . The biggest difference from the original version , however , is that every round starts with the winner of the previous round , exactly like on all three of the American pilots .",

      "Han dynasty",
      "The Han dynasty ( ) was the second imperial dynasty of China ( 202 BC \u2013 220 AD ) , established by the rebel leader Liu Bang and ruled by the House of Liu . Preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty ( 221\u2013206 BC ) and a warring interregnum known as the ChuHan contention ( 206\u2013202 BC ) , it was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty ( 9\u201323 AD ) established by the usurping regent Wang Mang , and was separated into two periods\u2014the Western Han ( 202 BC\u20139 AD ) and the Eastern Han ( 25\u2013220 AD ) \u2014before being succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period ( 220\u2013280 AD ) . Spanning over four centuries , the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history , and influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since . Modern Chinas majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the Han people , the Sinitic language is known as Han language , and the written Chinese is referred to as Han characters .",
      "The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States . From the reign of Emperor Wu ( BC ) onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu . This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912 AD .",
      "The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty ( BC ) . The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty ( 618\u2013907 AD ) . The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations . To finance its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories , the Han government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC , but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty . Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances , including the process of papermaking , the nautical steering ship rudder , the use of negative numbers in mathematics , the raised-relief map , the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy , and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes .",
      "The Xiongnu , a nomadic steppe confederation , defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior and vassal partner for several decades , but continued their military raids on the Han borders . Emperor Wu launched several military campaigns against them . The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries . These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty and control into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia , divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations , and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road , which reached as far as the Mediterranean world . The territories north of Hans borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation . Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south , annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC , and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC . After 92 AD , the palace eunuchs increasingly involved themselves in court politics , engaging in violent power struggles between the various consort clans of the empresses and empresses dowager , causing the Hans ultimate downfall . Imperial authority was also seriously challenged by large Daoist religious societies which instigated the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion . Following the death of Emperor Ling ( AD ) , the palace eunuchs suffered wholesale massacre by military officers , allowing members of the aristocracy and military governors to become warlords and divide the empire . When Cao Pi , king of Wei , usurped the throne from Emperor Xian , the Han dynasty ceased to exist .",
      "Etymology .",
      "According to the Records of the Grand Historian , after the collapse of the Qin dynasty the hegemon Xiang Yu appointed Liu Bang as prince of the small fief of Hanzhong , named after its location on the Han River ( in modern southwest Shaanxi ) . Following Liu Bangs victory in the Chu\u2013Han Contention , the resulting Han dynasty was named after the Hanzhong fief .",
      "History .",
      "Western Han .",
      "Chinas first imperial dynasty was the Qin dynasty ( 221\u2013207 BC ) . The Qin united the Chinese Warring States by conquest , but their regime became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huang . Within four years , the dynastys authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion . Two former rebel leaders , Xiang Yu ( d . 202 BC ) of Chu and Liu Bang ( d . 195 BC ) of Han , engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China , which had fissured into 18 kingdoms , each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang . Although Xiang Yu proved to be an effective commander , Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia ( 202 BC ) , in modern-day Anhui . Liu Bang assumed the title emperor ( huangdi ) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu ( BC ) . Changan ( known today as Xian ) was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han .",
      "At the beginning of the Western Han ( ) , also known as the Former Han ( ) dynasty , thirteen centrally controlled commanderies\u2014including the capital region\u2014existed in the western third of the empire , while the eastern two-thirds were divided into ten semi-autonomous kingdoms . To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu , Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed some of them as kings .",
      "By 196 BC , the Han court had replaced all but one of these kings ( the exception being in Changsha ) with royal Liu family members , since the loyalty of non-relatives to the throne was questioned . After several insurrections by Han kings\u2014the largest being the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BC\u2014the imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies . Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff ; this duty was assumed by the imperial court . Kings became nominal heads of their fiefs and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes . The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han .",
      "To the north of China proper , the nomadic Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu ( BC ) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe . By the end of his reign , he controlled Manchuria , Mongolia , and the Tarim Basin , subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand . Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders , and he established a trade embargo against the group .",
      "In retaliation , the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province , where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC . After negotiations , the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance , but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes , food , and wine to the Xiongnu .",
      "Despite the tribute and a negotiation between Laoshang Chanyu ( BC ) and Emperor Wen ( BC ) to reopen border markets , many of the Chanyus Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great Wall for additional goods . In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu ( BC ) in 135 BC , the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement . Emperor Wu accepted this , despite continuing Xiongnu raids .",
      "However , a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving the assassination of the Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han . When this plot failed in 133 BC , Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory . The assault culminated in 119 BC at the Battle of Mobei , where the Han commanders Huo Qubing ( d . 117 BC ) and Wei Qing ( d . 106 BC ) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert .",
      "After Wus reign , Han forces continued to prevail against the Xiongnu . The Xiongnu leader Huhanye Chanyu ( BC ) finally submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in 51 BC . His rival claimant to the throne , Zhizhi Chanyu ( BC ) , was killed by Chen Tang and Gan Yanshou ( \u7518\u5ef6\u58fd/\u7518\u5ef6\u5bff ) at the Battle of Zhizhi , in modern Taraz , Kazakhstan .",
      "In 121 BC , Han forces expelled the Xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur . They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC . In that year , the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region : Jiuquan , Zhangyi , Dunhuang , and Wuwei . The majority of people on the frontier were soldiers . On occasion , the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements , along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor . The court also encouraged commoners , such as farmers , merchants , landowners , and hired laborers , to voluntarily migrate to the frontier .",
      "Even before Hans expansion into Central Asia , diplomat Zhang Qians travels from 139 to 125 BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations . Zhang encountered Dayuan ( Fergana ) , Kangju ( Sogdiana ) , and Daxia ( Bactria , formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom ) ; he also gathered information on Shendu ( Indus River valley of North India ) and Anxi ( the Parthian Empire ) . All of these countries eventually received Han embassies . These connections marked the beginning of the Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire , bringing Han items like silk to Rome and Roman goods such as glasswares to China .",
      "From roughly 115 to 60 BC , Han forces fought the Xiongnu over control of the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin . Han was eventually victorious and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC , which dealt with the regions defense and foreign affairs . The Han also expanded southward . The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern Guangdong , Guangxi , and northern Vietnam . Yunnan was brought into the Han realm with the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC , followed by parts of the Korean Peninsula with the Han conquest of Gojoseon and colonial establishments of Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC . In Chinas first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD , the population was registered as having 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households .",
      "To pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion , Emperor Wu nationalized several private industries . He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants . These monopolies included salt , iron , and liquor production , as well as bronze-coin currency . The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC , and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han . The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty .",
      "The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court . The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wus reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang ( d . 68 BC ) . The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy . The Reformists , however , overturned these policies , favoring a cautious , non-expansionary approach to foreign policy , frugal budget reform , and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs .",
      "Wang Mangs reign and civil war .",
      "Wang Zhengjun ( 71 BC\u201313 AD ) was first empress , then empress dowager , and finally grand empress dowager during the reigns of the Emperors Yuan ( BC ) , Cheng ( BC ) , and Ai ( BC ) , respectively . During this time , a succession of her male relatives held the title of regent . Following the death of Ai , Wang Zhengjuns nephew Wang Mang ( 45 BC\u201323 AD ) was appointed regent as Marshall of State on 16 August under Emperor Ping ( AD ) .",
      "When Ping died on 3 February 6 AD , Ruzi Ying ( d . 25 AD ) was chosen as the heir and Wang Mang was appointed to serve as acting emperor for the child . Wang promised to relinquish his control to Liu Ying once he came of age . Despite this promise , and against protest and revolts from the nobility , Wang Mang claimed on 10 January that the divine Mandate of Heaven called for the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of his own : the Xin dynasty ( 9\u201323 AD ) .",
      "Wang Mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful . These reforms included outlawing slavery , nationalizing land to equally distribute between households , and introducing new currencies , a change which debased the value of coinage . Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition , Wangs regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of AD and 11 AD . Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works . The Yellow River split into two new branches : one emptying to the north and the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula , though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD .",
      "The flood dislodged thousands of peasant farmers , many of whom joined roving bandit and rebel groups such as the Red Eyebrows to survive . Wang Mangs armies were incapable of quelling these enlarged rebel groups . Eventually , an insurgent mob forced their way into the Weiyang Palace and killed Wang Mang .",
      "The Gengshi Emperor ( AD ) , a descendant of Emperor Jing ( BC ) , attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Changan as his capital . However , he was overwhelmed by the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed , assassinated , and replaced him with the puppet monarch Liu Penzi . Gengshis distant cousin Liu Xiu , known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu ( AD ) , after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Kunyang in 23 AD , was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor .",
      "Under Guangwus rule the Han Empire was restored . Guangwu made Luoyang his capital in 25 AD , and by 27 AD his officers Deng Yu and Feng Yi had forced the Red Eyebrows to surrender and executed their leaders for treason . From 26 until 36 AD , Emperor Guangwu had to wage war against other regional warlords who claimed the title of emperor ; when these warlords were defeated , China reunified under the Han .",
      "The period between the foundation of the Han dynasty and Wang Mangs reign is known as the Western Han ( ) or Former Han ( ) ( 206 BC\u20139 AD ) . During this period the capital was at Changan ( modern Xian ) . From the reign of Guangwu the capital was moved eastward to Luoyang . The era from his reign until the fall of Han is known as the Eastern Han or Later Han ( 25\u2013220 AD ) .",
      "Eastern Han .",
      "The Eastern Han ( ) , also known as the Later Han ( ) , formally began on 5 August AD 25 , when Liu Xiu became Emperor Guangwu of Han . During the widespread rebellion against Wang Mang , the state of Goguryeo was free to raid Hans Korean commanderies ; Han did not reaffirm its control over the region until AD 30 .",
      "The Tr\u01b0ng Sisters of Vietnam rebelled against Han in AD 40 . Their rebellion was crushed by Han general Ma Yuan ( d . AD 49 ) in a campaign from AD 42\u201343 . Wang Mang renewed hostilities against the Xiongnu , who were estranged from Han until their leader Bi ( \u6bd4 ) , a rival claimant to the throne against his cousin Punu ( \u84b2\u5974 ) , submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in AD 50 . This created two rival Xiongnu states : the Southern Xiongnu led by Bi , an ally of Han , and the Northern Xiongnu led by Punu , an enemy of Han .",
      "During the turbulent reign of Wang Mang , China lost control over the Tarim Basin , which was conquered by the Northern Xiongnu in AD 63 and used as a base to invade the Hexi Corridor in Gansu . Dou Gu ( d . 88 AD ) defeated the Northern Xiongnu at the Battle of Yiwulu in AD 73 , evicting them from Turpan and chasing them as far as Lake Barkol before establishing a garrison at Hami . After the new Protector General of the Western Regions Chen Mu ( d . AD 75 ) was killed by allies of the Xiongnu in Karasahr and Kucha , the garrison at Hami was withdrawn .",
      "At the Battle of Ikh Bayan in AD 89 , Dou Xian ( d . AD 92 ) defeated the Northern Xiongnu chanyu who then retreated into the Altai Mountains . After the Northern Xiongnu fled into the Ili River valley in AD 91 , the nomadic Xianbei occupied the area from the borders of the Buyeo Kingdom in Manchuria to the Ili River of the Wusun people . The Xianbei reached their apogee under Tanshihuai ( \u6a80\u77f3\u69d0 ) ( d . AD 180 ) , who consistently defeated Chinese armies . However , Tanshihuais confederation disintegrated after his death .",
      "Ban Chao ( d . AD 102 ) enlisted the aid of the Kushan Empire , occupying the area of modern India , Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Tajikistan , to subdue Kashgar and its ally Sogdiana . When a request by Kushan ruler Vima Kadphises ( ) for a marriage alliance with the Han was rejected in AD 90 , he sent his forces to Wakhan ( Afghanistan ) to attack Ban Chao . The conflict ended with the Kushans withdrawing because of lack of supplies . In AD 91 , the office of Protector General of the Western Regions was reinstated when it was bestowed on Ban Chao .",
      "Foreign travelers to Eastern-Han China include Buddhist monks who translated works into Chinese , such as An Shigao from Parthia , and Lokaksema from Kushan-era Gandhara , India . In addition to tributary relations with the Kushans , the Han Empire received gifts from the Parthian Empire , from a king in modern Burma , from a ruler in Japan , and initiated an unsuccessful mission to Daqin ( Rome ) in AD 97 with Gan Ying as emissary .",
      "A Roman embassy of Emperor Marcus Aurelius ( AD ) is recorded in the Weil\u00fce and Hou Hanshu to have reached the court of Emperor Huan of Han ( AD ) in AD 166 , yet Rafe de Crespigny asserts that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants . In addition to Roman glasswares and coins found in China , Roman medallions from the reign of Antoninus Pius and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius have been found at \u00d3c Eo in Vietnam . This was near the commandery of Rinan ( also Jiaozhi ) where Chinese sources claim the Romans first landed , as well as embassies from Tianzhu ( in northern India ) in the years 159 and 161 . \u00d3c Eo is also thought to be the port city Cattigara described by Ptolemy in his Geography ( AD ) as lying east of the Golden Chersonese ( Malay Peninsula ) along the Magnus Sinus ( i.e . Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea ) , where a Greek sailor had visited .",
      "Emperor Zhangs ( AD ) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house . Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans . In 92 AD , with the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong ( d . 107 AD ) , Emperor He ( AD ) had Empress Dowager Dou ( d . 97 AD ) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power . This was in revenge for Dous purging of the clan of his natural mother\u2014Consort Liang\u2014and then concealing her identity from him . After Emperor Hes death , his wife Empress Deng Sui ( d . 121 AD ) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD .",
      "When Empress Dowager Deng died , Emperor An ( AD ) was convinced by the accusations of the eunuchs Li Run ( ) and Jiang Jing ( ) that Deng and her family had planned to depose him . An dismissed Dengs clan members from office , exiled them and forced many to commit suicide . After Ans death , his wife , Empress Dowager Yan ( d . 126 AD ) placed the child Marquess of Beixiang on the throne in an attempt to retain power within her family . However , palace eunuch Sun Cheng ( d . 132 AD ) masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone Emperor Shun of Han ( AD ) . Yan was placed under house arrest , her relatives were either killed or exiled , and her eunuch allies were slaughtered . The regent Liang Ji ( d . 159 AD ) , brother of Empress Liang Na ( d . 150 AD ) , had the brother-in-law of Consort Deng Mengn\u00fc ( later empress ) ( d . 165 AD ) killed after Deng Mengn\u00fc resisted Liang Jis attempts to control her . Afterward , Emperor Huan employed eunuchs to depose Liang Ji , who was then forced to commit suicide .",
      "Students from the Imperial University organized a widespread student protest against the eunuchs of Emperor Huans court . Huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of concubines in his harem at a time of economic crisis . Palace eunuchs imprisoned the official Li Ying ( ) and his associates from the Imperial University on a dubious charge of treason . In 167 AD , the Grand Commandant Dou Wu ( d . 168 AD ) convinced his son-in-law , Emperor Huan , to release them . However the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office , marking the beginning of the Partisan Prohibitions .",
      "Following Huans death , Dou Wu and the Grand Tutor Chen Fan ( d . 168 AD ) attempted a coup d\u00e9tat against the eunuchs Hou Lan ( d . 172 AD ) , Cao Jie ( d . 181 AD ) , and Wang Fu ( ) . When the plot was uncovered , the eunuchs arrested Empress Dowager Dou ( d . 172 AD ) and Chen Fan . General Zhang Huan ( ) favored the eunuchs . He and his troops confronted Dou Wu and his retainers at the palace gate where each side shouted accusations of treason against the other . When the retainers gradually deserted Dou Wu , he was forced to commit suicide .",
      "Under Emperor Ling ( AD ) the eunuchs had the partisan prohibitions renewed and expanded , while also auctioning off top government offices . Many affairs of state were entrusted to the eunuchs Zhao Zhong ( d . 189 AD ) and Zhang Rang ( d . 189 AD ) while Emperor Ling spent much of his time roleplaying with concubines and participating in military parades .",
      "End of the Han dynasty .",
      "The Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD , largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions . The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue ( d . 184 AD ) and Zhang Lu ( d . 216 AD ) , respectively .",
      "Zhang Lus rebellion , in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi , was not quelled until 215 AD . Zhang Jues massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year , however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings . Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated , many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority .",
      "General-in-Chief He Jin ( d . 189 AD ) , half-brother to Empress He ( d . 189 AD ) , plotted with Yuan Shao ( d . 202 AD ) to overthrow the eunuchs by having several generals march to the outskirts of the capital . There , in a written petition to Empress He , they demanded the eunuchs execution . After a period of hesitation , Empress He consented . When the eunuchs discovered this , however , they had her brother He Miao ( ) rescind the order . The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22 , 189 AD .",
      "Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyangs Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu ( d . 199 AD ) besieged the Southern Palace . On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed . Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao ( AD ) and his brother Liu Xie\u2014the future Emperor Xian of Han ( AD ) . While being pursued by the Yuan brothers , Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River .",
      "General Dong Zhuo ( d . 192 AD ) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside . He escorted them safely back to the capital and was made Minister of Works , taking control of Luoyang and forcing Yuan Shao to flee . After Dong Zhuo demoted Emperor Shao and promoted his brother Liu Xie as Emperor Xian , Yuan Shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against Dong , who burned Luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at Changan in May 191 AD . Dong Zhuo later poisoned Emperor Shao .",
      "Dong was killed by his adopted son L\u00fc Bu ( d . 198 AD ) in a plot hatched by Wang Yun ( d . 192 AD ) . Emperor Xian fled from Changan in 195 AD to the ruins of Luoyang . Xian was persuaded by Cao Cao ( 155\u2013220 AD ) , then Governor of Yan Province in modern western Shandong and eastern Henan , to move the capital to Xuchang in 196 AD .",
      "Yuan Shao challenged Cao Cao for control over the emperor . Yuans power was greatly diminished after Cao defeated him at the Battle of Guandu in 200 AD . After Yuan died , Cao killed Yuan Shaos son Yuan Tan ( 173\u2013205 AD ) , who had fought with his brothers over the family inheritance . His brothers Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi were killed in 207 AD by Gongsun Kang ( d . 221 AD ) , who sent their heads to Cao Cao .",
      "After Caos defeat at the naval Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD , China was divided into three spheres of influence , with Cao Cao dominating the north , Sun Quan ( 182\u2013252 AD ) dominating the south , and Liu Bei ( 161\u2013223 AD ) dominating the west . Cao Cao died in March 220 AD . By December his son Cao Pi ( 187\u2013226 AD ) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Wei . This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between three states : Cao Wei , Eastern Wu , and Shu Han .",
      "Culture and society .",
      "Social class .",
      "In the hierarchical social order , the emperor was at the apex of Han society and government . However the emperor was often a minor , ruled over by a regent such as the empress dowager or one of her male relatives . Ranked immediately below the emperor were the kings who were of the same Liu family clan . The rest of society , including nobles lower than kings and all commoners excluding slaves belonged to one of twenty ranks ( ershi gongcheng ) .",
      "Each successive rank gave its holder greater pensions and legal privileges . The highest rank , of full marquess , came with a state pension and a territorial fiefdom . Holders of the rank immediately below , that of ordinary marquess , received a pension , but had no territorial rule . Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige . The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses .",
      "By the Eastern Han period , local elites of unattached scholars , teachers , students , and government officials began to identify themselves as members of a larger , nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship . When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han , many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office .",
      "The farmer , or specifically the small landowner-cultivator , was ranked just below scholars and officials in the social hierarchy . Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status , such as tenants , wage laborers , and slaves . The Han dynasty made adjustments to slavery in China and saw an increase in agricultural slaves . Artisans , technicians , tradespeople and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants .",
      "State-registered merchants , who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes , were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status . These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces ; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials .",
      "Wealthy landowners , such as nobles and officials , often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties , sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle . Unlike slaves , retainers could come and go from their masters home as they pleased . Medical physicians , pig breeders , and butchers had a fairly high social status , while occultist diviners , runners , and messengers had low status .",
      "Marriage , gender , and kinship .",
      "The Han-era family was patrilineal and typically had four to five nuclear family members living in one household . Multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy the same house , unlike families of later dynasties . According to Confucian family norms , various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy . For example , there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle .",
      "Marriages were highly ritualized , particularly for the wealthy , and included many important steps . The giving of betrothal gifts , known as bridewealth and dowry , were especially important . A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife , but as a concubine . Arranged marriages were normal , with the fathers input on his offsprings spouse being considered more important than the mothers .",
      "Monogamous marriages were also normal , although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers . Under certain conditions dictated by custom , not law , both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry . However , a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husbands family after his death . In order to remarry , the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee . Her children would not be allowed to go with her .",
      "Apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks , inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture ; each son received an equal share of the family property . Unlike the practice in later dynasties , the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune . Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries , though this was usually much less than the shares of sons . A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will , but it is unclear how common this was .",
      "Women were expected to obey the will of their father , then their husband , and then their adult son in old age . However , it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule , especially in regard to mothers over their sons , and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers . Women were exempt from the annual corv\u00e9e labor duties , but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning .",
      "The most common occupation for women was weaving clothes for the family , sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women . Other women helped on their brothers farms or became singers , dancers , sorceresses , respected medical physicians , and successful merchants who could afford their own silk clothes . Some women formed spinning collectives , aggregating the resources of several different families .",
      "Education , literature , and philosophy .",
      "The early Western Han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of Legalism , Huang-Lao Daoism , and Confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy . However , the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage . He abolished all academic chairs or erudites ( b\u00f3sh\u00ec \u535a\u58eb ) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BCE and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BCE .",
      "Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius , or Kongzi ( 551\u2013479 BCE ) , Han Confucianism in Emperor Wus reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu ( 179\u2013104 BCE ) . Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual , filial piety , and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies . Much to the interest of the ruler , Dongs synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe .",
      "The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century CE . A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns , where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments .",
      "Some important texts were created and studied by scholars . Philosophical works written by Yang Xiong ( 53 BCE \u2013 18 CE ) , Huan Tan ( 43 BCE \u2013 28 CE ) , Wang Chong ( 27\u2013100 CE ) , and Wang Fu ( 78\u2013163 CE ) questioned whether human nature was innately good or evil and posed challenges to Dongs universal order . The Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Tan ( d . 110 BCE ) and his son Sima Qian ( 145\u201386 BCE ) established the standard model for all of imperial Chinas Standard Histories , such as the Book of Han written by Ban Biao ( 3\u201354 CE ) , his son Ban Gu ( 32\u201392 CE ) , and his daughter Ban Zhao ( 45\u2013116 CE ) . There were dictionaries such as the Shuowen Jiezi by Xu Shen ( \u2013 CE ) and the Fangyan by Yang Xiong .",
      "Biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen . Han dynasty poetry was dominated by the fu genre , which achieved its greatest prominence during the reign of Emperor Wu .",
      "Law and order .",
      "Han scholars such as Jia Yi ( 201\u2013169 BCE ) portrayed the previous Qin dynasty as a brutal regime . However , archaeological evidence from Zhangjiashan and Shuihudi reveal that many of the statutes in the Han law code compiled by Chancellor Xiao He ( d . 193 BCE ) were derived from Qin law .",
      "Various cases for rape , physical abuse and murder were prosecuted in court . Women , although usually having fewer rights by custom , were allowed to level civil and criminal charges against men . While suspects were jailed , convicted criminals were never imprisoned . Instead , punishments were commonly monetary fines , periods of forced hard labor for convicts , and the penalty of death by beheading . Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law . A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado .",
      "Acting as a judge in lawsuits was one of many duties of the county magistrate and Administrators of commanderies . Complex , high-profile or unresolved cases were often deferred to the Minister of Justice in the capital or even the emperor . In each Han county was several districts , each overseen by a chief of police . Order in the cities was maintained by government officers in the marketplaces and constables in the neighborhoods .",
      "Food .",
      "The most common staple crops consumed during Han were wheat , barley , foxtail millet , proso millet , rice , and beans . Commonly eaten fruits and vegetables included chestnuts , pears , plums , peaches , melons , apricots , strawberries , red bayberries , jujubes , calabash , bamboo shoots , mustard plant , and taro . Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens , Mandarin ducks , geese , cows , sheep , pigs , camels , and dogs ( various types were bred specifically for food , while most were used as pets ) . Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes . Commonly hunted game , such as owl , pheasant , magpie , sika deer , and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed . Seasonings included sugar , honey , salt , and soy sauce . Beer and wine were regularly consumed .",
      "Clothing .",
      "The types of clothing worn and the materials used during the Han period depended upon social class . Wealthy folk could afford silk robes , skirts , socks , and mittens , coats made of badger or fox fur , duck plumes , and slippers with inlaid leather , pearls , and silk lining . Peasants commonly wore clothes made of hemp , wool , and ferret skins .",
      "Religion , cosmology , and metaphysics .",
      "Families throughout Han China made ritual sacrifices of animals and food to deities , spirits , and ancestors at temples and shrines . They believed that these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm . It was thought that each person had a two-part soul : the spirit-soul ( hun \u9b42 ) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals ( xian ) , and the body-soul ( po \u9b44 ) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony .",
      "In addition to his many other roles , the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to Heaven , the main deities known as the Five Powers , and the spirits ( shen \u795e ) of mountains and rivers . It was believed that the three realms of Heaven , Earth , and Mankind were linked by natural cycles of yin and yang and the five phases . If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual , ethics , and morals , he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes , floods , droughts , epidemics , and swarms of locusts .",
      "It was believed that immortality could be achieved if one reached the lands of the Queen Mother of the West or Mount Penglai . Han-era Daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises , sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs .",
      "By the 2nd century CE , Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice . Its followers believed that the sage-philosopher Laozi ( ) was a holy prophet who would offer salvation and good health if his devout followers would confess their sins , ban the worship of unclean gods who accepted meat sacrifices and chant sections of the Daodejing .",
      "Buddhism first entered Imperial China through the Silk Road during the Eastern Han , and was first mentioned in 65 CE . Liu Ying ( d . 71 CE ) , a half-brother to Emperor Ming of Han ( CE ) , was one of its earliest Chinese adherents , although Chinese Buddhism at this point was heavily associated with Huang-Lao Daoism . Chinas first known Buddhist temple , the White Horse Temple , was constructed outside the wall of the capital , Luoyang , during Emperor Mings reign . Important Buddhist canons were translated into Chinese during the 2nd century CE , including the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters , Perfection of Wisdom , Shurangama Sutra , and Pratyutpanna Sutra .",
      "Government and politics .",
      "Central government .",
      "In Han government , the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver , the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations ; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher . Theoretically , there were no limits to his power .",
      "However , state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference ( tingyi \u5ef7\u8b70 ) \u2014where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue\u2014pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions . If the emperor rejected a court conference decision , he risked alienating his high ministers . Nevertheless , emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences .",
      "Below the emperor were his cabinet members known as the Three Councillors of State ( San gong \u4e09\u516c ) . These were the Chancellor or Minister over the Masses ( Chengxiang \u4e1e\u76f8 or Da situ \u5927\u53f8\u5f92 ) , the Imperial Counselor or Excellency of Works ( Yushi dafu \u5fa1\u53f2\u5927\u592b or Da sikong \u5927\u53f8\u7a7a ) , and Grand Commandant or Grand Marshal ( Taiwei \u592a\u5c09 or Da sima \u5927\u53f8\u99ac ) .",
      "The Chancellor , whose title was changed to Minister over the Masses in 8 BC , was chiefly responsible for drafting the government budget . The Chancellors other duties included managing provincial registers for land and population , leading court conferences , acting as judge in lawsuits and recommending nominees for high office . He could appoint officials below the salary-rank of 600 bushels .",
      "The Imperial Counselors chief duty was to conduct disciplinary procedures for officials . He shared similar duties with the Chancellor , such as receiving annual provincial reports . However , when his title was changed to Minister of Works in 8 BC , his chief duty became oversight of public works projects .",
      "The Grand Commandant , whose title was changed to Grand Marshal in 119 BC before reverting to Grand Commandant in 51 AD , was the irregularly posted commander of the military and then regent during the Western Han period . In the Eastern Han era he was chiefly a civil official who shared many of the same censorial powers as the other two Councillors of State .",
      "Ranked below the Three Councillors of State were the Nine Ministers ( Jiu qing \u4e5d\u537f ) , who each headed a specialized ministry . The Minister of Ceremonies ( Taichang \u592a\u5e38 ) was the chief official in charge of religious rites , rituals , prayers and the maintenance of ancestral temples and altars . The Minister of the Household ( Guang lu xun \u5149\u797f\u52f3 ) was in charge of the emperors security within the palace grounds , external imperial parks and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot .",
      "The Minister of the Guards ( Weiwei \u885b\u5c09 ) was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls , towers , and gates of the imperial palaces . The Minister Coachman ( Taipu \u592a\u50d5 ) was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables , horses , carriages and coach-houses for the emperor and his palace attendants , as well as the supply of horses for the armed forces . The Minister of Justice ( Tingwei \u5ef7\u5c09 ) was the chief official in charge of upholding , administering , and interpreting the law . The Minister Herald ( Da honglu \u5927\u9d3b\u81da ) was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests at the imperial court , such as nobles and foreign ambassadors .",
      "The Minister of the Imperial Clan ( Zongzheng \u5b97\u6b63 ) oversaw the imperial courts interactions with the empires nobility and extended imperial family , such as granting fiefs and titles . The Minister of Finance ( Da sinong \u5927\u53f8\u8fb2 ) was the treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces who handled tax revenues and set standards for units of measurement . The Minister Steward ( Shaofu \u5c11\u5e9c ) served the emperor exclusively , providing him with entertainment and amusements , proper food and clothing , medicine and physical care , valuables and equipment .",
      "Local government .",
      "The Han empire , excluding kingdoms and marquessates , was divided , in descending order of size , into political units of provinces , commanderies , and counties . A county was divided into several districts ( xiang \u9109 ) , the latter composed of a group of hamlets ( li \u91cc ) , each containing about a hundred families .",
      "The heads of provinces , whose official title was changed from Inspector to Governor and vice versa several times during Han , were responsible for inspecting several commandery-level and kingdom-level administrations . On the basis of their reports , the officials in these local administrations would be promoted , demoted , dismissed or prosecuted by the imperial court .",
      "A governor could take various actions without permission from the imperial court . The lower-ranked inspector had executive powers only during times of crisis , such as raising militias across the commanderies under his jurisdiction to suppress a rebellion .",
      "A commandery consisted of a group of counties , and was headed by an Administrator . He was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense , lawsuits , seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by Emperor Wu . The head of a large county of about 10,000 households was called a Prefect , while the heads of smaller counties were called Chiefs , and both could be referred to as Magistrates . A Magistrate maintained law and order in his county , registered the populace for taxation , mobilized commoners for annual corv\u00e9e duties , repaired schools and supervised public works .",
      "Kingdoms and marquessates .",
      "Kingdoms\u2014roughly the size of commanderies\u2014were ruled exclusively by the emperors male relatives as semi-autonomous fiefdoms . Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives , granted to them in return for their services to Emperor Gaozu . The administration of each kingdom was very similar to that of the central government . Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom , kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs .",
      "However , in 145 BC , after several insurrections by the kings , Emperor Jing removed the kings rights to appoint officials whose salaries were higher than 400 bushels . The Imperial Counselors and Nine Ministers ( excluding the Minister Coachman ) of every kingdom were abolished , although the Chancellor was still appointed by the central government .",
      "With these reforms , kings were reduced to being nominal heads of their fiefs , gaining a personal income from only a portion of the taxes collected in their kingdom . Similarly , the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquesss fief were appointed by the central government . A marquesss Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect . Like a king , the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income .",
      "Up until the reign of Emperor Jing of Han , the Emperors of the Han had great difficulty bringing the vassal kings under control , as kings often switched their allegiance to the Xiongnu Chanyu whenever threatened by Imperial attempts to centralize power . Within the seven years of Han Gaozus reign , three vassal kings and one marquess either defected to or allied with the Xiongnu . Even imperial princes in control of fiefdoms would sometimes invite the Xiongnu to invade in response to threats by the Emperor to remove their power . The Han emperors moved to secure a treaty with the Chanyu to demarcate authority between them , recognizing each other as the two masters ( \u5169\u4e3b ) , the sole representatives of their respective peoples , cemented with a marriage alliance ( heqin ) , before eliminating the rebellious vassal kings in 154 BC . This prompted some vassal kings of the Xiongnu to switch their allegiance to the Han emperor from 147 BC . Han court officials were initially hostile to the idea of disrupting the status quo and expanding into the Xiongnu steppe territory . The surrendered Xiongnu were integrated into a parallel military and political structure under the Han Emperor , and opened the avenue for the Han dynasty to challenge the Xiongnu cavalry on the steppe . This also introduced the Han to the interstate networks in the Tarim Basin ( Xinjiang ) , allowing for the expansion of the Han dynasty from a limited regional state to a universalist and cosmopolitan empire through further marriage alliances with another steppe power , the Wusun .",
      "Military .",
      "At the beginning of the Han dynasty , every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military . The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhaos ( BC ) reign . Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers . The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces : infantry , cavalry or navy . The year of active service was served either on the frontier , in a kings court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital . A small professional ( paid ) standing army was stationed near the capital .",
      "During the Eastern Han , conscription could be avoided if one paid a commutable tax . The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army . The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army ( Nanjun \u5357\u8ecd ) , while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army ( Beijun \u5317\u8ecd ) . Led by Colonels ( Xiaowei \u6821\u5c09 ) , the Northern Army consisted of five regiments , each composed of several thousand soldiers . When central authority collapsed after 189 AD , wealthy landowners , members of the aristocracy/nobility , and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops . The latter were known as \u90e8\u66f2 , a special social class in Chinese history .",
      "During times of war , the volunteer army was increased , and a much larger militia was raised across the country to supplement the Northern Army . In these circumstances , a General ( Jiangjun \u5c07\u8ecd ) led a division , which was divided into regiments led by Colonels and sometimes Majors ( Sima \u53f8\u99ac ) . Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains . Platoons were the smallest units of soldiers .",
      "Economy .",
      "Currency .",
      "The Han dynasty inherited the ban liang coin type from the Qin . In the beginning of the Han , Emperor Gaozu closed the government mint in favor of private minting of coins . This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc Zhi ( d . 180 BC ) , who abolished private minting . In 182 BC , L\u00fc Zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins . This caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2.6 g ( 0.09 oz ) in weight .",
      "In 144 BC Emperor Jing abolished private minting in favor of central-government and commandery-level minting ; he also introduced a new coin . Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC , but a year later he abandoned the ban liangs entirely in favor of the wuzhu ( \u4e94\u9296 ) coin , weighing 3.2 g ( 0.11 oz ) . The wuzhu became Chinas standard coin until the Tang dynasty ( 618\u2013907 AD ) . Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mangs regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu .",
      "Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight , the central government closed commandery mints and monopolized the issue of coinage in 113 BC . This Central government issuance of coinage was overseen by the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks , this duty being transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han .",
      "Taxation and property .",
      "Aside from the landowners land tax paid in a portion of their crop yield , the poll tax and property taxes were paid in coin cash . The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors . Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins . The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD , an average of 220,000,000 coins a year .",
      "The widespread circulation of coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land , empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes . Emperor Wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land , yet powerful merchants were able to avoid registration and own large tracts of land .",
      "The small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the Han tax base ; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords . The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms . These reforms included reducing taxes , temporary remissions of taxes , granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts .",
      "In 168 BC , the land tax rate was reduced from one-fifteenth of a farming households crop yield to one-thirtieth , and later to a one-hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty . The consequent loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes .",
      "The labor tax took the form of conscripted labor for one month per year , which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six . This could be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax , since hired labor became more popular .",
      "Private manufacture and government monopolies .",
      "In the early Western Han , a wealthy salt or iron industrialist , whether a semi-autonomous king or wealthy merchant , could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand . This kept many peasants away from their farms and denied the government a significant portion of its land tax revenue . To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs , Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the state monopolies . By Eastern Han times , the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations , as well as private businessmen .",
      "Liquor was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in 98 BC . However , this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2 L ( 0.05 gallons ) was levied for those who traded it privately . By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants . Apart from Emperor Mings creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization , which was abolished in 68 AD , central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han .",
      "Science and technology .",
      "The Han dynasty was a unique period in the development of premodern Chinese science and technology , comparable to the level of scientific and technological growth during the Song dynasty ( 960\u20131279 ) .",
      "Writing materials .",
      "In the 1st millennium BC , typical ancient Chinese writing materials were bronzewares , animal bones , and bamboo slips or wooden boards . By the beginning of the Han dynasty , the chief writing materials were clay tablets , silk cloth , hemp paper , and rolled scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string ; these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps .",
      "The oldest known Chinese piece of hempen paper dates to the 2nd century BC . The standard papermaking process was invented by Cai Lun ( AD 50\u2013121 ) in 105 . The oldest known surviving piece of paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a Han watchtower that had been abandoned in AD 110 , in Inner Mongolia .",
      "Metallurgy and agriculture .",
      "Evidence suggests that blast furnaces , that convert raw iron ore into pig iron , which can be remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron by means of a cold blast and hot blast , were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period ( 722\u2013481 BC ) . The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China ; however , the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization . Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process .",
      "The Han dynasty Chinese used bronze and iron to make a range of weapons , culinary tools , carpenters tools and domestic wares . A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools . The three-legged iron seed drill , invented by the 2nd century BC , enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand . The heavy moldboard iron plow , also invented during the Han dynasty , required only one man to control it , two oxen to pull it . It had three plowshares , a seed box for the drills , a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m ( 11.3 acres ) of land in a single day .",
      "To protect crops from wind and drought , the grain intendant Zhao Guo ( \u8d99\u904e ) created the alternating fields system ( daitianfa \u4ee3\u7530\u6cd5 ) during Emperor Wus reign . This system switched the positions of furrows and ridges between growing seasons . Once experiments with this system yielded successful results , the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it . Han farmers also used the pit field system ( \u51f9\u7530 ) for growing crops , which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain . In southern and small parts of central Han-era China , paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice , while farmers along the Huai River used transplantation methods of rice production .",
      "Structural and geotechnical engineering .",
      "Timber was the chief building material during the Han dynasty ; it was used to build palace halls , multi-story residential towers and halls and single-story houses . Because wood decays rapidly , the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles . The oldest surviving wooden halls in China date to the Tang dynasty ( AD 618\u2013907 ) . Architectural historian Robert L . Thorp points out the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains , and claims that often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture .",
      "Though Han wooden structures decayed , some Han-dynasty ruins made of brick , stone , and rammed earth remain intact . This includes stone pillar-gates , brick tomb chambers , rammed-earth city walls , rammed-earth and brick beacon towers , rammed-earth sections of the Great Wall , rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood , and two rammed-earth castles in Gansu . The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Changan and Luoyang still stand , along with their drainage systems of brick arches , ditches , and ceramic water pipes . Monumental stone pillar-gates , twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period , formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites . These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles , eaves , and balustrades .",
      "The courtyard house is the most common type of home portrayed in Han artwork . Ceramic architectural models of buildings , like houses and towers , were found in Han tombs , perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife . These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture . The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites .",
      "Over ten Han-era underground tombs have been found , many of them featuring archways , vaulted chambers , and domed roofs . Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits . The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown .",
      "From Han literary sources , it is known that wooden-trestle beam bridges , arch bridges , simple suspension bridges , and floating pontoon bridges existed in Han China . However , there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature , and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge .",
      "Underground mine shafts , some reaching depths over , were created for the extraction of metal ores . Borehole drilling and derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt . The distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines . These boreholes perhaps reached a depth of 600 m ( 2000 ft ) .",
      "Mechanical and hydraulic engineering .",
      "Han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them . Professional artisan-engineers ( jiang \u5320 ) did not leave behind detailed records of their work . Han scholars , who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering , sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described . Nevertheless , some Han literary sources provide crucial information .",
      "For example , in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine , which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing . The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital . Around AD 180 , Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings . Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the worlds first known zoetrope lamp .",
      "Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources . As observed in Han miniature tomb models , but not in literary sources , the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff . The odometer cart , invented during Han , measured journey lengths , using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled . This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century , yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century .",
      "Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty , for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements . These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured . These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources .",
      "The waterwheel appeared in Chinese records during the Han . As mentioned by Huan Tan about AD 20 , they were used to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers , and were used in pounding , threshing and polishing grain . However , there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century . The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi ( d . 38 AD ) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron . Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches . The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century Balanced Discourse .",
      "The armillary sphere , a three-dimensional representation of the movements in the celestial sphere , was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC . Using a water clock , waterwheel and a series of gears , the Court Astronomer Zhang Heng ( AD 78\u2013139 ) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere . To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock , Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel .",
      "Zhang also invented a device he termed an earthquake weathervane ( \u5019\u98a8\u5730\u52d5\u5100 ) , which the British biochemist , sinologist , and historian Joseph Needham described as the ancestor of all seismographs . This device was able to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away . It employed an inverted pendulum that , when disturbed by ground tremors , would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths ( representing all eight directions ) into a metal toads mouth .",
      "The account of this device in the Book of the Later Han describes how , on one occasion , one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance . Several days later , a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in Longxi Commandery ( in modern Gansu Province ) , the direction the device had indicated , which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of Zhangs device .",
      "Mathematics .",
      "Three Han mathematical treatises still exist . These are the Book on Numbers and Computation , the Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art . Han-era mathematical achievements include solving problems with right-angle triangles , square roots , cube roots , and matrix methods , finding more accurate approximations for pi , providing mathematical proof of the Pythagorean theorem , use of the decimal fraction , Gaussian elimination to solve linear equations , and continued fractions to find the roots of equations .",
      "One of the Hans greatest mathematical advancements was the worlds first use of negative numbers . Negative numbers first appeared in the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art as black counting rods , where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods . Negative numbers were also used by the Greek mathematician Diophantus around AD 275 , and in the 7th-century Bakhshali manuscript of Gandhara , South Asia , but were not widely accepted in Europe until the 16th century .",
      "The Han applied mathematics to various diverse disciplines . In musical tuning , Jing Fang ( 78\u201337 BC ) realized that 53 perfect fifths was approximate to 31 octaves while creating a musical scale of 60 tones , calculating the difference at \u2044 ( the same value of 53 equal temperament discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator [ 1620\u20131687 ] , i.e . 3/2 ) .",
      "Astronomy .",
      "Mathematics were essential in drafting the astronomical calendar , a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year . During the spring and autumn periods of the 5th century BC , the Chinese established the Sifen calendar ( \u53e4\u56db\u5206\u5386 ) , which measured the tropical year at 365.25 days . This was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu calendar ( \u592a\u521d\u66c6 ) that measured the tropical year at ( ~ 365.25016 ) days and the lunar month at days . However , Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar .",
      "Han Chinese astronomers made star catalogues and detailed records of comets that appeared in the night sky , including recording the 12 BC appearance of the comet now known as Halleys Comet .",
      "Han dynasty astronomers adopted a geocentric model of the universe , theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere surrounding the earth in the center . They assumed that the Sun , Moon , and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped . They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight , that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon , and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth . Although others disagreed with his model , Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds .",
      "Cartography , ships , and vehicles .",
      "Evidence found in Chinese literature , and archaeological evidence , show that cartography existed in China before the Han . Some of the earliest Han maps discovered were ink-penned silk maps found amongst the Mawangdui Silk Texts in a 2nd-century-BC tomb . The general Ma Yuan created the worlds first known raised-relief map from rice in the 1st century . This date could be revised if the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang is excavated and the account in the Records of the Grand Historian concerning a model map of the empire is proven to be true .",
      "Although the use of the graduated scale and grid reference for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of Pei Xiu ( AD 224\u2013271 ) , there is evidence that in the early 2nd century , cartographer Zhang Heng was the first to use scales and grids for maps .",
      "Han dynasty Chinese sailed in a variety of ships different from those of previous eras , such as the tower ship . The junk design was developed and realized during the Han era . Junk ships featured a square-ended bow and stern , a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost , and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels . Moreover , Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern , in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport , allowing them to sail on the high seas .",
      "Although ox-carts and chariots were previously used in China , the wheelbarrow was first used in Han China in the 1st century BC . Han artwork of horse-drawn chariots shows that the Warring-States-Era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horses chest was replaced by the softer breast strap . Later , during the Northern Wei ( 386\u2013534 ) , the fully developed horse collar was invented .",
      "Medicine .",
      "Han-era medical physicians believed that the human body was subject to the same forces of nature that governed the greater universe , namely the cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the five phases . Each organ of the body was associated with a particular phase . Illness was viewed as a sign that qi or vital energy channels leading to a certain organ had been disrupted . Thus , Han-era physicians prescribed medicine that was believed to counteract this imbalance .",
      "For example , since the wood phase was believed to promote the fire phase , medicinal ingredients associated with the wood phase could be used to heal an organ associated with the fire phase . Besides dieting , Han physicians also prescribed moxibustion , acupuncture , and calisthenics as methods of maintaining ones health . When surgery was performed by the Chinese physician Hua Tuo ( d . AD 208 ) , he used anesthesia to numb his patients pain and prescribed a rubbing ointment that allegedly sped the process of healing surgical wounds . Whereas the physician Zhang Zhongjing ( \u2013 ) is known to have written the Shanghan lun ( Dissertation on Typhoid Fever ) , it is thought that both he and Hua Tuo collaborated in compiling the Shennong Ben Cao Jing medical text ."

Baker , who was Secretary of War , during 1916-1920 , while he presided over Americas mass mobilization of men and material in World War I . After the assassination of president John F . Kennedy in 1963 , Jacqueline Kennedy purchased the house and lived here for about a year .",

      "History .",
      "The house was built in 1794 by Thomas Beall . During its early years , the house was situated on a large plot of land and was said to have had a servants wing attached to the east side . At that time N Street was known as Gay Street and was situated higher than today .",
      "In 1796 , John Laird , a wealthy merchant , lived in the house , and later Maj . George Peter , a War of 1812 commander and Maryland Congressman , purchased the house who lived there until 1827 , when the same Laird bought the house for his son . In 1834 , William Redin , the first auditor of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia , purchased it .",
      "In 1868 , Redins unmarried daughter inherited and sold the dwelling , which became the Georgetown Female Seminary . The Seminary had a student body of boarders and day students totaling 105 . In approximately 1890 , John H . Smoot bought the building and converted it back to a private residence again .",
      "In 1915 , Col . William E . Pattison French purchased the house , and began renting it to Newton D . Baker in 1916 . When Baker returned to Cleveland in 1920 , French either leased or lived in the house himself for more than two decades . During the World War II , the British military attache occupied the house and rented rooms to British officers .",
      "After the World War II , Vice Admiral Alan Kirk , later Ambassador to Belgium and to the Soviet Union , purchased the property . Three years later , Dr . E . H . Gushing bought the home along with his wife . They sold the attached servants wing as a separate residence to Mr . and Mrs . Stanley Woodward who built a new front entrance and lived in the home . The Cushings updated the main houses electrical wiring and plumbing and removed some of the interior walls therefore enlarging the living room .",
      "In 1954 , James McMillan Gibson bought the dwelling , added a small rear wing , and installed an elevator and lived there with his wife .",

      "In 1965 , Michael Whitney Straight purchased the home for $200,000 ( ) , from Kennedy when she moved to New York City . While living in the home , Straight married his second wife , Nina G . Auchincloss Steers in 1974 . Nina was the daughter of Nina Gore and Hugh D . Auchincloss . She was the half-sister of writer Gore Vidal and coincidentally , a stepsister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . Straight and his wife spent $125,000 ( ) renovating the home and decided to move to Bethesda , Maryland in 1976 when he was vice chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts . Straight and his wife lived in the home from until 1976 .",

      "Niva ( magazine )",
      "Niva ( ) ( Grainfield ) was the most popular magazine of late-nineteenth-century Russia ; it lasted from 1870 to 1918 , and defined itself on its masthead as an illustrated weekly journal of literature , politics and modern life . Niva was the first of the thin magazines , illustrated weeklies that contrasted with the more serious and ideologically focused monthly thick journals intended for the educated reader .",
      "History .",
      "It was founded by A . F . Marx , a German immigrant who saw that Russia lacked moderately priced magazines of general interest . He intended Niva to be a politically neutral family magazine , but the periodical soon outgrew its original purpose and became an ambitious vehicle for the dissemination of good literature in the provinces . It was read by an audience that extended from primary schoolteachers , rural parish priests , and the urban middle class to the gentry . One of its most popular features was the bonus premiums offered as an inducement to subscribe ; at first these consisted of large colored prints of art in traditional style by artists such as Konstantin Makovsky . Later science and literature supplements were added , as well as a childrens section ; by the end of the century , the most important premium was the collected works of Russian classical authors : By 1912 Niva subscribers had received much of the best in Russian literature , including the works of Gogol , Lermontov , Goncharov , Dostoevsky , Turgenev , Leskov , Chekhov , and others .",
      "In his autobiography , Maxim Gorky says that his employers in the early 1880s subscribed to Niva for the cut-out patterns and the prize offers ; but they never read it ; he himself , however , was enthralled by the volumes he pulled out from under their bed and read at night : [ T ] he pictures and their captions.. . placed in my ken a world which widened every day , a world splendid like the cities of romance . They brought me views of lofty peaks and lovely beaches . Life unfolded its marvels ; earth became more enchanting , studded with towns and laden with treasures .",
      "Niva was very successful ; starting with 9,000 readers in its first year , by the early twentieth century it had a circulation of over 200,000 . Its editorial office was at 22 Malaya Morskaya Street . It was a large publication , almost the size of a tabloid newspaper ; in 1900 a typical issue had 24 pages . Most of the text consisted of serialized fiction by respected writers ; there were also short news and sports reports , ethnographic essays , and notes on science and technology , as well as information on all aspects of city life . Its editors included Viktor Klyushnikov ( 1870 to 1892 , with interruptions ) , Dmitry Stakheev ( 1875\u20141877 ) , Fedor Berg ( 1878\u20141887 ) , Mikhail Volkonsky ( 1892\u20141894 ) , Alexei Tikhonov-Lugovoi ( 1895\u20141897 ) , Rostislav Sementkovsky ( 1897\u20141904 ) , and Valerian Ivchenko-Svetlov ( 1910\u20141916 ) .",
      "Among its contributors over the years were A . K . Tolstoy , Fyodor Tyutchev , Leo Tolstoy ( his Resurrection was first serialized in Niva ) , Nikolai Leskov , Grigory Danilevsky , Afanasy Fet , Anton Chekhov , Maxim Gorky , Vladimir Solovyov , Alexander Blok , Sergei Yesenin , Korney Chukovsky , Ivan Bunin , Osip Mandelstam , Anna Akhmatova , Nikolay Gumilyov , Valery Bryusov , Dmitry Merezhkovsky , Georgy Ivanov , Konstantin Balmont , Mikhail Kuzmin , Fyodor Sologub , Teffi , Alexander Grin , and Ilya Ehrenburg , among many others .",
      "After Marxs death in 1904 , Niva was published by the A . F . Marx Publishing and Printing Company , which was bought by the literary entrepreneur Ivan Sytin in 1916 . It continued to be popular after the October Revolution , especially in the provinces ( in the capitals it was the object of frequent jokes by the sophisticated ) , but was closed by the Bolsheviks in September 1918 .",

      "Thomas Silverstein",
      "Thomas Silverstein ( February 4 , 1952 \u2013 May 11 , 2019 ) was an American criminal who spent the last 42 years of his life in prison after being convicted of four separate murders while imprisoned for armed robbery , one of which was overturned . Silverstein spent the last 36 years of his life in solitary confinement for killing Corrections Officer Merle Clutts at the Marion Penitentiary in Illinois . Prison authorities described him as a brutal killer and a former leader of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang . Silverstein maintained that the dehumanizing conditions inside the prison system contributed to the three murders he committed . He was held in a specially designed cell in what is called Range 13 at ADX Florence federal penitentiary in Colorado . He was the longest-held prisoner in solitary confinement within the Bureau of Prisons at the time of his death .",
      "Early life .",
      "Thomas Silverstein was born in Long Beach , California , to Virginia Conway . Conway had divorced her first husband in 1952 while pregnant with Silverstein and married Thomas Conway , who Silverstein claimed was his biological father . Four years later , Virginia divorced Conway and married Sid Silverstein , who legally adopted her son .",
      "Silverstein was timid , awkward , shy , and frequently bullied as a child in the middle-class neighborhood where the family lived , in part because his peers mistakenly believed he was Jewish . Virginia Silverstein demanded that her son fight back , telling the boy that if he ever came home again crying because he had been beaten up by a bully , she would be waiting to give him another beating . Silverstein states , Thats how my mom was . She stood her mud . If someone came at you with a bat , you got your bat and you both went at it . At age fourteen , Silverstein was sentenced to a California Youth Authority reformatory where , he said , his attitudes about violence were reinforced . Anyone not willing to fight was abused .",
      "In 1971 , at age nineteen , Silverstein was sent to San Quentin Prison in California for armed robbery . Four years later , he was paroled , but he was arrested soon after along with his father , Thomas Conway , and his cousin , Gerald Hoff , for three armed robberies . Their take was less than $11,000 . In 1977 , Silverstein was sentenced to fifteen years for armed robbery , to be served at United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth , Kansas .",
      "Murders at USP Marion .",
      "While at Leavenworth , Silverstein developed ties with the Aryan Brotherhood . In 1980 , Silverstein was convicted of the murder of inmate Danny Atwell , who reportedly refused to serve as a mule for heroin being moved through the prison . He was sentenced to life without parole and transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Marion , Illinois ( USP Marion ) , which was then a high security facility . The conviction was overturned in 1985 after it emerged that the jailhouse informants who testified at his trial had perjured themselves on the stand .",
      "At Marion , Silverstein was housed in the Control Unit , a virtual solitary confinement regime reserved for extreme management problems ( prisoners prone to assaultive and disruptive behavior ) in the prison .",
      "In 1981 , Silverstein was accused of the murder of Robert Chappelle , a member of the D.C . Blacks prison gang . Silverstein and another inmate , Clayton Fountain , were convicted and Silverstein received an additional life sentence . Silverstein maintained his innocence . While Silverstein was on trial for Chappelles murder , the Bureau of Prisons transferred Raymond Cadillac Smith , the national leader of the D.C . Blacks prison gang , from another prison into the control unit in Marion . From the moment Smith arrived in the control unit , prison logs show that he began trying to kill Silverstein .",
      "I tried to tell Cadillac that I didnt kill Chappelle , but he didnt believe me and he bragged that he was going to kill me , Silverstein recalled . Everyone knew what was going on and no one did anything to keep us apart . The guards wanted one of us to kill the other . Silverstein and Clayton Fountain killed Smith with improvised weapons , stabbing him 67 times . After Smith was dead , they dragged his body up and down the catwalk in front of the cells , displaying it to other prisoners . Silverstein received another life sentence .",
      "Murder of Correction Officer Clutts .",
      "On October 22 , 1983 , Silverstein killed Correction Officer Merle Clutts at USP Marion . After being let out of his cell for a shower , Silverstein used a ruse to get Clutts to walk ahead of him and positioned himself between Clutts and other officers . He stopped outside the cell of another inmate , Randy Gometz . Gometz passed a homemade prison knife to Silverstein and unlocked Silversteins handcuffs with a homemade key . Silverstein then attacked Clutts , stabbing him multiple times . Silverstein later claimed that he murdered Clutts in retaliation for Clutts deliberately harassing him . Among other things , Clutts was accused of destroying paintings by Silverstein .",
      "A few hours later , Clayton Fountain ( also an Aryan Brotherhood member ) used the same strategy to kill Correctional Officer Robert Hoffmann .",
      "USP Marion was subsequently placed on an indefinite lockdown , which ultimately lasted for 23 years . Following the murder of Clutts , Silverstein was transferred to the United States Penitentiary , Atlanta , where he was placed in solitary confinement . His security status was recorded as no human contact . The events surrounding the murders of Correctional Officer Clutts and Hoffmann inspired the design of the federal supermax prison , the United States Penitentiary , Florence ADX ( USP Florence ADX ) in Colorado , which opened in 1994 and was built to house the most dangerous inmates in the federal prison system . Silverstein and Gometz were both held at ADX Florence . Fountain died at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield , Missouri in 2004 .",
      "Riot in Atlanta and transfer to Leavenworth .",
      "During the 1987 Atlanta Prison Riots , Cuban detainees at the Atlanta federal penitentiary released Silverstein from his isolation cell . They handed Silverstein over to the Federal Bureau of Investigations Hostage Rescue Team one week later . Bureau of Prisons officials were reportedly afraid that Silverstein would begin killing correctional officers held hostage by the Cubans . Before the Cubans released Silverstein to Bureau of Prisons , the Cubans let Silverstein out of his isolation cell and Silverstein was able to roam freely about the prison . One of the prison guards being held hostage had a history of being kind to Silverstein . ( When the guard would handcuff Silverstein he would make it a point to ask Silverstein if his handcuffs were too tight. ) He was confronted by Silverstein and was ultimately spared by him . Bureau of Prisons negotiators were able to convince the Cuban riot leaders to hand over Silverstein as a gesture of good faith , a relatively easy decision for them , given that Silversteins status was peripheral to the aims of the Cuban leaders during the riot .",
      "Silverstein was subsequently moved back to Leavenworth , where he stayed for the next 18 years .",
      "In 2005 , when USP Leavenworth was downgraded to a medium-security facility , Silverstein was moved to ADX Florence , a supermax facility in Colorado . His earliest theoretical date of release was November 2 , 2095 .",
      "Allegations of torture and injustice .",
      "Silverstein claimed that no human contact status is essentially a form of torture reserved for those who kill correctional officers . When an inmate kills a guard , he must be punished , a Bureau of Prisons official told author Pete Earley . We cant execute Silverstein , so we have no choice but to make his life a living hell . Otherwise other inmates will kill guards too . There has to be some supreme punishment . Every convict knows what Silverstein is going through . We want them to realize that if they cross the same line that he did , they will pay a heavy price . Ted Sellers , a former convict who met Silverstein during 25 years spent in prison , said he became a legend at Leavenworth . Sellers told BBC News Online , He is not as bad as they portray . Sure he is dangerous if they push him to the wall . But there were some dirty rotten guards at Marion\u2026 They would purposely screw you around . You are dealing with a person locked up 23 hours a day . Of course hes got a short fuse .",
      "Death .",
      "Silverstein died on May 11 , 2019 , after spending 36 years in solitary confinement ; he died from complications from heart surgery ."

      "Friedrich Wilhelm Otto Modersohn ( 22 February 1865 , Soest \u2013 10 March 1943 , Rotenburg ) was a German landscape painter . He was a co-founder of the Art Colony at Worpswede .",
      "Life .",
      "In 1884 , he began his studies at the Art Academy of D\u00fcsseldorf . Four years later , he moved to the Academy of Fine Arts , Karlsruhe , where he studied under Hermann Baisch . In July 1889 , he made his first visit to Worpswede with Fritz Mackensen . In August , Hans am Ende followed . They were later joined by Fritz Overbeck ( 1893 ) and Heinrich Vogeler ( 1894 ) ; all students from D\u00fcsseldorf . In 1895 , they presented their first group exhibition at the Kunsthalle Bremen . They were largely panned by the critics , but went on to a major breakthrough at the Munich Glaspalast .",
      "In 1897 , the Art Colony was officially established and Modersohn married Helene Schr\u00f6der ( 1868-1900 ) , the daughter of a Bremen merchant . Two years later , he resigned from the association , citing his continuing fight for the personal , individual liberty of every artist . Vogeler and Overbeck joined him in leaving . The couple had one daughter , Elsbeth ( 1898-1984 ) . The next year , his wife died after a long illness . In 1901 , he remarried . His new wife , Paula Becker , was also a well-known painter . She died in 1907 , of an embolism , shortly after giving birth to their daughter Mathilde Tille ( 1907-1998 ) . At that point , Modersohn felt that he could not remain in Worpswede and moved to Fischerhude , a nearby village . His third wife was , daughter of the painter Heinrich Breling . She was primarily a singer , but painted as well . They had two sons , Ulrich ( 1913-1943 ) and , who also became a painter .",
      "In 1911 , when the Kunsthalle Bremen purchased Van Goghs Field with Poppies , Modersohn was the only Worpswede artist to support the museum , concluding that nationalistic sentiments should play no role in the world of art . In the 1920s and early 30s , he and Louise made extensive study trips throughout Germany and , in 1933 , he acquired an old farmhouse on the Gailenberg in Bad Hindelang for use as a studio . Three years later , he became blind in his right eye , due to a detached retina . This forced him to remain in his studio rather than paint outdoors . He was awarded the Goethe Medal for Art & Science in 1940 .

      "Fulk , King of Jerusalem",
      "Fulk ( , or Foulques ; c . 1089/92 \u2013 13 November 1143 ) , also known as Fulk the Younger , was the count of Anjou ( as Fulk V ) from 1109 to 1129 and the king of Jerusalem from 1131 to his death . During his reign , the Kingdom of Jerusalem reached its largest territorial extent .",
      "Count of Anjou .",
      "Fulk was born at Angers , between 1089 and 1092 , the son of Count Fulk IV of Anjou and Bertrade de Montfort . In 1092 , Bertrade deserted her husband , and bigamously married King Philip I of France .",
      "Fulk V became count of Anjou upon his fathers death in 1109 . In the next year , he married Countess Ermengarde of Maine , cementing Angevin control over the County of Maine .",
      "Fulk was originally an opponent of King Henry I of England and a supporter of King Louis VI of France , but in 1118 or 1119 he allied with Henry when he arranged for his daughter Matilda to marry Henrys son William Adelin . Fulk went on crusade in 1119 or 1120 , and became attached to the Knights Templar ( Orderic Vitalis ) . He returned , late in 1121 , after which he began to subsidize the Templars , maintaining two knights in the Holy Land for a year . Much later , Henry arranged for his own daughter Matilda to marry Fulks son Geoffrey , which she did in 1127 or 1128 .",
      "Crusader and king .",
      "By 1127 Fulk was preparing to return to Anjou when he received an embassy from King Baldwin II of Jerusalem . Baldwin II had no male heirs but had already designated his daughter Melisende to succeed him . Baldwin II wanted to safeguard his daughters inheritance by marrying her to a powerful lord . Fulk was a wealthy crusader and experienced military commander , and a widower . His experience in the field would prove invaluable in a frontier state always in the grip of war .",
      "However , Fulk held out for better terms than mere consort of the queen ; he wanted to be king alongside Melisende . Baldwin II , reflecting on Fulks fortune and military exploits , acquiesced . Fulk abdicated his county seat of Anjou to his son Geoffrey and left for Jerusalem , where he married Melisende on 2 June 1129 . Later Baldwin II bolstered Melisendes position in the kingdom by making her sole guardian of her son by Fulk , Baldwin III , born in 1130 .",
      "Fulk and Melisende became joint rulers of Jerusalem in 1131 with Baldwin IIs death . From the start Fulk assumed sole control of the government , excluding Melisende altogether . He favored fellow countrymen from Anjou to the native nobility . The other crusader states to the north feared that Fulk would attempt to impose the suzerainty of Jerusalem over them , as Baldwin II had done ; but as Fulk was far less powerful than his deceased father-in-law , the northern states rejected his authority . Melisendes sister Alice of Antioch , exiled from the Principality by Baldwin II , took control of Antioch once more after the death of her father . She allied with Pons of Tripoli and Joscelin II of Edessa to prevent Fulk from marching north in 1132 ; Fulk and Pons fought a brief battle before peace was made and Alice was exiled again .",
      "In Jerusalem as well , Fulk was resented by the second generation of Jerusalem Christians who had grown up there since the First Crusade . These natives focused on Melisendes cousin , the popular Hugh II of Le Puiset , count of Jaffa , who was devotedly loyal to Melisende . Fulk saw Hugh as a rival , and it did not help matters when Hughs own stepson accused him of disloyalty . In 1134 , in order to expose Hugh , Fulk accused him of infidelity with Melisende . Hugh rebelled in protest . Hugh secured himself to Jaffa , and allied himself with the Muslims of Ascalon . He was able to defeat the army set against him by Fulk , but this situation could not hold . The patriarch interceded in the conflict , perhaps at the behest of Melisende . Fulk agreed to peace and Hugh was exiled from the kingdom for three years , a lenient sentence .",
      "However , an assassination attempt was made against Hugh . Fulk , or his supporters , were commonly believed responsible , though direct proof never surfaced . The scandal was all that was needed for the queens party to take over the government in what amounted to a palace coup . Author and historian wrote that Fulks supporters went in terror of their lives in the palace . Contemporary author and historian William of Tyre wrote of Fulk : He never attempted to take the initiative , even in trivial matters , without ( Melisendes ) consent . The result was that Melisende held direct and unquestioned control over the government from 1136 onwards . Sometime before 1136 Fulk reconciled with his wife , and a second son , Amalric , was born .",
      "Securing the borders .",
      "Jerusalems northern border was of great concern . Fulk had been appointed regent of the Principality of Antioch by Baldwin II . As regent he had Raymond of Poitou marry the infant Princess Constance of Antioch , his and Melisendes niece . However , the greatest concern during Fulks reign was the rise of Atabeg Zengi of Mosul .",
      "In 1137 Fulk was defeated in battle near Baarin but allied with Muin ad-Din Unur , the vizier of Damascus . Damascus was also threatened by Zengi . Fulk captured the fort of Banias , to the north of Lake Tiberias and thus secured the northern frontier .",
      "Fulk also strengthened the kingdoms southern border . His butler Paganus built the fortress of Kerak to the east of the Dead Sea , and to help give the kingdom access to the Red Sea , Fulk had Blanchegarde , Ibelin , and other forts built in the south-west to overpower the Egyptian fortress at Ascalon . This city was a base from which the Egyptian Fatimids launched frequent raids on the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Fulk sought to neutralise this threat .",
      "In 1137 and 1142 , Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus arrived in Syria attempting to impose Byzantine control over the crusader states . Johns intention of making a pilgrimage , accompanied by his impressive army , to Jerusalem alarmed Fulk , who wrote to John pointing out that his kingdom was poor and could not support the passage of a large army . This lukewarm response dissuaded John from carrying through his intention , and he postponed his pilgrimage . John died before he could make good his proposed journey to Jerusalem .",
      "Death .",
      "In 1143 , while the king and queen were in Acre , Fulk was killed in a hunting accident . His horse stumbled , fell , and Fulks skull was crushed by the saddle , and his brains gushed forth from both ears and nostrils , as William of Tyre describes . He was carried back to Acre , where he lay unconscious for three days before he died . He was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem . Though their marriage started in conflict , Melisende mourned for him privately as well as publicly . Fulk was survived by his son Geoffrey by his first wife , and Baldwin and Amalric by Melisende .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Depictions .",
      "According to William , Fulk was a ruddy man , like David.. . faithful and gentle , affable and kind.. . an experienced warrior full of patience and wisdom in military affairs . His chief fault was an inability to remember names and faces .",
      "William of Tyre described Fulk as a capable soldier and able politician , but observed that Fulk did not adequately attend to the defense of the crusader states to the north . Ibn al-Qalanisi ( who calls him al-Kund Anjur , an Arabic rendering of Count of Anjou ) says that he was not sound in his judgment nor was he successful in his administration . The Zengids continued their march on the crusader states , culminating in the fall of the County of Edessa in 1144 , which led to the Second Crusade ( see Siege of Edessa ) .",
      "Family .",
      "In 1110 , Fulk married Ermengarde of Maine ( died 1126 ) , the daughter of Elias I of Maine . Their four children were :",
      "1 . Geoffrey V of Anjou ( 1113\u20131151 ) , father of Henry II of England .",
      "2 . Sibylla of Anjou ( 1112\u20131165 , Bethlehem ) , married in 1123 William Clito ( div . 1124 ) , married in 1134 Thierry , Count of Flanders .",
      "3 . Matilda of Anjou ( 1106\u20131154 , Fontevrault ) , married William Adelin ; after his death in the White Ship disaster of 1120 , she became a nun and later Abbess of Fontevrault .",

      "James Lanier",
      "James Franklin Doughty Lanier ( November 22 , 1800 \u2013 August 27 , 1881 ) was an entrepreneur who lived in Madison , Indiana prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War ( 1861\u20131865 ) . Lanier became a wealthy banker with interests in pork packing , the railroads , and real estate .",
      "Early life .",
      "James Lanier was born in 1800 in Beaufort County , North Carolina to Alexander Chalmers Sr . ( 1778-1820 ) and Drusilla Cleaves Doughty ( died 1838 ) . His home was in Bourbon county Kentucky from 1802 to 1807 and then in Eaton Ohio until 1817 , when his family moved to Madison , Indiana , the year after it became a state and lived at Schofield House . He studied law at Transylvania University and began practicing in 1820 . According to an ad placed in the Indiana Republican newspaper of August 17 , 1820 , Laniers first law office at Madison was \u201cin the south wing of Col . Stapp\u2019s brick house , in the room\u2026at present occupied by Dr . [ Robert ] Cravens,\u201d father of the man Laniers daughter Drucilla would later marry .",
      "Career .",
      "During the 1820s , he was assistant clerk for the Indiana Legislature and later Clerk of the Indiana House of Representatives , where he was involved in assisting to move the capital from Corydon to Indianapolis in 1825 .",
      "In the early 1830s , Lanier became involved in banking . He became president of the Bank of Indiana in 1833 and eventually became a large shareholder of its Madison branch and was also on the board of directors that oversaw all branches . In the later 1830s , Lanier was involved with construction of the states first major rail line connecting Madison and Indianapolis . He became a major stockholder in the line , which was finally finished in 1847 . The line turned out to be very profitable .",
      "The same year , Lanier represented Indiana in a meeting with its European creditors . The state was on the verge of bankruptcy due to extreme overspending on internal improvement over the previous decade and was liquidating its assets . Lanier was able to negotiate the transfer of ownership of most of the Indiana canals to their bond holders in exchange for a 50% reduction in the value of the bonds .",
      "His sudden wealth allowed him to build a large mansion in Madison ; it was completed in 1844 . His wife Elizabeth died in 1846 and he was remarried to Margaret Mary McClure in 1848 .",
      "In 1849 , he began trading railroad shares in New York in a bank he started there in the same year with Richard Winslow called Winslow , Lanier & Co. . In 1851 , he moved out of the state to New York , where he would manage his new business . He never moved back to Indiana .",
      "At the request of Gov . Oliver P . Morton , Lanier loaned the Indiana government over one million dollars without security to help the state avoid bankruptcy during the American Civil War . The money was used to pay interest on the state debt and outfit troops . It was all repaid by 1870 . The state , grateful for his help , has preserved his residence in Madison , the Lanier Mansion , as a state historic site .",
      "Personal life .",
      "In 1819 , he married his first wife , Elizabeth G . Gardner ( 1798\u20131846 ) . Following Elizabeths death , he married Margaret Mary McClure ( 1825-1903 ) .",

She was launched on 16 March 1940 and commissioned on 20 April under Oberleutnant zur See ( Oblt.z.S. ) Ernst Bauer .",

      "The Chinese Nationalist government used 10,000,000 Marks to order two Type IIB U-boats in 1937 . They also dispatched 80 men to Germany for training in submarine operations . The Japanese government complained about this transaction , so the Chinese took their money back and these two vessels joined the Kriegsmarine after the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe . They were U-120 and U-121 .",

Along with her sister boat , she was originally built for export to China . The advent of World War II and increased training needs , led the German high command to assign U-120 and U-121 to the training command . From 20 April 1940 to 30 June she was part of the U-Bootschulflottille . In July 1940 she became part of the 21st U-boat Flotilla as a training boat until 16 March 1945 when she became part of the 31st U-boat Flotilla ( training ) until 2 May 1945 when she was scuttled at Bremerhaven .

      "Asocia\u021bia Club Sportiv Poli Timi\u0219oara ( ) , commonly known as Poli Timi\u0219oara , is a Romanian professional football club based in Timi\u0219oara , Timi\u0219 County , currently playing in the Liga III .",
      "The club is credited as the official record holder and legal successor of the original club founded in 1921 , FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara , which went bankrupt and was dissolved , following the 2011\u201312 season . It is co-owned by the City Council and the County Council and has the backing of the Politehnica University of Timi\u0219oara , all three being active members in the legal entity running the club .",
      "The team has won two Romanian Cups and was twice a runner-up in Liga I . It is ranked 5th in the Liga I All-Time Table , with 48 seasons played .",
      "Poli Timi\u015foara traditionally plays in white and purple kits , although it has used variations of black and white in the past . The clubs current home ground is Electrica stadium , although most of its history it played on Dan P\u0103ltini\u0219anu Stadium .",
      "History .",
      "Beginnings of Politehnica Timi\u0219oara ( 1921\u20131945 ) .",
      "The club was founded in 1921 by the Polytechnic University of Timi\u0219oara under the name Societatea Sportiva Politehnica .",
      "Its initial aim was to provide an opportunity for university students to work on their fitness within a competitive environment . The logistics of the sport proved problematic , as there were limited financial means available . Thanks to contributions gathered from university professors and employees , the club bought their first football kits , with white-black vertical stripes , and rented the Patria football stadium . It was not until 1928 that the club developed its own training grounds , Politehnica , which were built by volunteers . Players for the team were chosen on merit from the pool of Timi\u0219oara students and high-schoolers , who trained after school hours during the week and played football on weekends . The football landscape in the city was already developed at that time , with CAT , RGMT and Chinezul dominating locally .",
      "After spending three years in the District Championships II , Politehnica won promotion to the first tier in 1924 , by defeating Kadima Timi\u0219oara . The club became established in the years to come , even finishing 2nd in the 1926\u201327 District Championships I , when Politehnica lost out to Chinezul by a single point , who were one of Romanias most famous football names at the time . However , the competitive level could not be easily sustained by a university club , as it was subject to the inflow and outflow of players conditioned by their student status . After a decline towards the end of the decade , the low-point came at the beginning of the 1930s , between 1931 and 1933 , when due to insufficient material resources , Politehnica had to suspend its football activities . It reappeared in 1934 but remained a modest club , with mid-table classifications in the District Championships I , as well as the Divizia C and Divizia B , once they were founded . As war beckoned , the national championships were suspended and all football activities reduced to friendly matches and the Cupa Eroilor ( 1943\u201344 ) .",
      "Until the second World War , Politehnica was far from the number one Timi\u0219oara football club . Chinezul and then Ripensia won multiple Romanian championship , whereas the students club failed to achieve similar results . It did , however , propel several players to the Romania national football team , with the likes of Sfera , Ignu\u0163a , Deheleanu , Chiroiu , Pop , Protopopescu and Sepi all wearing the national jerseys .",
      "Establishment as one of the citys most representative clubs ( 1945\u20131991 ) .",
      "With Romania under a communist regime , these decades were a challenge for Politehnica , as the club represented an educational institution of the highest tier . The numerous promotions and relegations between the first two national leagues were contrasted by the two Romanian cups won and the clubs first forays into international football .",
      "Politehnica was first promoted to Romanian top league , the Divizia A , in 1948 , and played under the name CSU Timi\u0219oara in the first season . Shortly thereafter ( from 1950 ) , the club was renamed \u0218tiin\u021ba Timi\u0219oara , in line with the desired nomenclature of the times . In spite of suffering its first relegation in 1951 , the decade was an unusually consistent one , with the club returning swiftly to the top division and staying there until the season 1959 . The high-point of the \u015etiin\u0163a years was winning the 1957\u201358 Romanian Cup , a 1\u20130 victory against Progresul Bucure\u0219ti , with the club finishing joint first in the league in the same season , but losing out on goal difference .",
      "The next decade saw the club struggle to remain in the first league , particularly towards the end of the 60s . However , it was then that the clubs modern identity started taking shape . Firstly , in 1963 , the largest stadium in Timi\u015foara was completed . It was initially named 1 Mai , honoring the socialist workers day , before being renamed several times in the 90s and finally settling on Stadionul Dan P\u0103ltini\u015fanu . Secondly , the club reverted to its previous name of Politehnica Timi\u0219oara in 1966 and went to play during the next five decades on the then-erected stadium .",
      "When Politehnica returned to the first league in 1973 , after struggling to win promotion for several years , it went on to celebrate one of its best streaks in the top flight . With the likes of Emeric Dembrovschi and Dan P\u0103ltini\u015fanu in the team , who both played for Romania and went on to become some of the most capped players in the clubs history , and under the management of prof . Ion V . Ionescu , Politehnica lost that seasons cup final . After managing a third place in the league with manager Angelo Niculescu in 1978 , Politehnica took part in a continental competition for the first time . It was the 1978\u201379 UEFA Cup , where Poli defeated MTK Budapest ( 2\u20130 and 1\u20132 ) , before going down to Honved Budapest ( 2\u20130 and 0\u20134 ) in the second round .",
      "The club remained steady and managed to win its second cup trophy the following season , by beating Steaua Bucure\u0219ti with 2\u20131 , after extra time . Politehnica thereby qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners Cup , where it managed to eliminate Celtic Glasgow ( 1\u20130 and 1\u20132 ) , before being defeated by West Ham United ( 1\u20130 and 0\u20134 ) in second leg . In spite of losing another Romanian Cup final in 1981 , the club qualified once more for the UEFA Cup Winners Cup , where they lost to Leipzig 2\u20135 on aggregate .",
      "After being relegated in 1983 , Politehnica yo-yo-ed between Divizia A and the Divizia B , with promotions in 1984 , 1987 , 1989 and relegations in 1986 and 1988 . Fans ironically called this period as the ABBA years . As the Romanian Revolution , which started in Timi\u0219oara , signalled the end of an era , Politehnica managed to grab its most impressive result yet in European competitions , by eliminating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid ( 2\u20130 and 0\u20131 ) in the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup .",
      "Privatization and detachment from the Polytechnic University ( 1991\u20132001 ) .",
      "By state order , all public institutions were forced to relinquish and reorganize any owned sports clubs in 1991 , to effectively privatize them . As a result , alongside the newly organized football club appeared a non-profit association , AFC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara . The latter , consisting of previous club players and staff , was mandated with owning and protecting the club records and intellectual property .",
      "The clubs swan song near the top of Romanian football for the next decade was to be the 1991\u201392 season . Poli finished 5th and also reached the Romanian Cup final , only to lose it on penalties against Steaua Bucure\u0219ti . The consequent participation in the 1992\u201393 UEFA Cup , saw the club draw against Real Madrid ( 1\u20131 in Timi\u0219oara ) , before being defeated in the return leg ( 0\u20134 ) . Politehnica lost several key players in the years after the forced privatization , which slowly lead to the teams downfall . In fewer than twenty four months from their draw against Real , the club was relegated to the Divizia B in 1994 . Despite a fast return to the first league in 1995 , Poli failed to consolidate their position and were soon relegated once more after the 1996\u201397 season .",
      "An inability to rebound lead to mounting financial pressures . The club was temporarily owned by a Timi\u0219oara based businessman between 1998 and 2000 , before the local authorities accepted the bid of an Italian investor , Claudio Zambon , to take over Politehnica . Despite an initial financial outlay , Poli finished 15th and was relegated to the third league , Divizia C , where it had last played in 1938 . To avoid such an outcome , Zambon and the local authorities struck a deal with a league two club , Dacia Pite\u0219ti , and purchased their license to participate in the Divizia B . After failing to earn promotion to top flight , the 2001\u201302 season posed an insurmountable challenge for Politehnica . Zambons departure following disagreements with the local authorities meant the club found itself in dire financial straits . Forced to use mostly youth players , Politehnica finished the season dead last , with one win and four draws to its name , but negative eight points in the standings , due to unpaid debts . Once again the club was bound to be relegated to the third division .",
      "Identity crisis , glory years and downfall ( 2002\u20132012 ) .",
      "In 2002 , AEK Bucharest were promoted to Liga I , Romanian footballs top division , for the first time , whereupon Anton Dobo\u0219 , the clubs owner , moved it to Timi\u0219oara . It was renamed Politehnica AEK Timi\u0219oara after merging with CSU Politehnica , a club owned and run by the Politehnica University , and received the full support of local authorities and white-purple fans . After a rocky first season , which required a spectacular relegation play-off against Gloria Buz\u0103u to avoid demotion , Poli AEK consolidated during the next season , finishing on a safe mid-table position . Moreover , starting with the 2004\u201305 season , the team changed its name to FCU Politehnica Timi\u0219oara , trying to reestablish its former identity .",
      "Financially difficulties looming , Politehnica changed ownership once more . Former president Anton Dobo\u0219 stayed on at the club for another year in a new position , while Balkan Petroleum Ltd. , owned by Marian Iancu , took full charge . Significant investments in the transfer market transformed the club overnight , as it received the nickname EuroPoli for its newly found ambitions to reach the top of Romanian football .",
      "During the takeover by Marian Iancu , a dispute regarding the proprietary rights for the club name , colors and records arose . After prolonged litigation , Politehnica was forced to change its name to FC Timi\u0219oara , following a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport . It was deemed that the colors and records dating before 2002 were lost in favor of former Politehnica Timi\u0219oara owner , Claudio Zambon . The Italian had struck a deal with AFC Politehnica , the non-profit association which owned said proprietary items , when he left Timi\u0219oara during the 2001\u201302 season .",
      "Results on the pitch improved immediately after the takeover , but a leap to the Liga 1 podium proved elusive until 2008\u201309 , when Politehnica finished runner-up , a feat repeated two seasons later . The club did , however , rejoin European football the season before that by qualifying for the UEFA Cup \u2013 sixteen years after its last appearance against Atletico Madrid . More European appearances followed , culminating with the qualification for the 3rd preliminary round of the 2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League . The team defeated the reigning UEFA Cup champions Shakhtar Donetsk , but were eliminated from the competition during the Playoff Round , which still meant the club would take part in the 2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League group stage .",
      "In November 2010 , the Romanian Court of Appeal returned Politehnicas name , colors and records to FC Timi\u0219oara . However , at the end of the season , despite finishing second in the Liga I standings , the club was relegated to Liga II after failing to meet the licence requirements to play in the first division . Under the name of Politehnica Timi\u015foara , they took part in the 2011\u201312 Liga II season and finished first , but were again denied the licence to play in Liga I . Consequently , the club filed for bankruptcy and was dissolved in September 2012 .",
      "Rebirth as ACS Poli Timi\u0219oara and recent years ( 2012\u2013present ) .",
      "In the summer of 2012 , ACS Reca\u0219 , a club just promoted to the Liga II , was moved to Timi\u0219oara and renamed ACS Poli Timi\u0219oara after the dissolution of FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara . The new club is co-owned by the City Council and the County Council and has the backing of the Politehnica University of Timi\u0219oara , all three being active members in the legal entity running the club . However , the ultras supporters rejected the move and decided to support an alternative project in the lower leagues , ASU Politehnica Timi\u015foara .",
      "Valentin Velcea continued as head coach , while the roster consisted mostly of the core ACS Reca\u0219 players and several players from FC Politehnica . At its conception , the club , established as an NGO , was primarily financed by the local authorities , as Timi\u0219oara mayor Nicolae Robu insisted control should not be forfeited to private investors . After initially playing in black/white/yellow kits , in order to avoid legal complications while the court ruled over the rightful owner following the bankruptcy of FC Politehnica , the club returned to its historic white-purple colors starting with the 2015\u20132016 season . As of February 2016 , ACS Poli Timi\u015foara is the sole and full owner of all the rights pertaining to and deriving from the Politehnica Timi\u0219oara brand and records , following a court decision which nullified the original agreement between the founding club and record holders , and Marian Iancus insolvent club .",
      "From a competitive perspective , the club failed to equal the achievements of the Marian Iancu era . A yo-yo-ing between the first two leagues , reminiscent of the Politehnicas travails in the 1980s , ensued . The situation was amplified by the fact that the financing received from the local authorities was deemed illegal in the summer of 2015 , which left the club without its main financial benefactor . The highlight season for the new Poli came about in 2016\u20132017 , when the club started with a 14 points penalty , as it failed to reach a points minimum the previous year and recorded unpaid debts . In spite of this , Poli , under the management of Ionu\u0163 Popa , rallied to reach the relegation play-off in the dying minutes of the season and defeated rivals UTA Arad 5\u20132 on aggregate . Moreover , the club reached the first national cup final , finishing runner-up in the Cupa Ligii , while also reaching the semi-finals of the Romanian Cup .",
      "The following season was another struggle and Poli suffered a reversal of fortunes as they were relegated by courtesy of a goal scored late in the last matchday . With financial pressures mounting , the club declared insolvency during the 2018\u20132019 Liga 2 season and struggled to stay competitive , becoming involved in another fight to avoid relegation . In order to mitigate costs , it was also forced to relocate from the Dan P\u0103ltini\u015fanu stadium to the Electrica stadium .",
      "Supporters and Rivalries .",
      "Historically , Poli has been the most prominent football club in Timi\u0219oara after 1945 , playing consistently in either the first or the second tier of Romanian football . Local rivalries with CFR Timi\u0219oara and UM Timi\u0219oara were relevant until the early 2000s . Afterwards , the former was relegated to a semi-professional status in the lower leagues and the latter was dissolved in 2008 .",
      "Nationally , there were strong rivalries with UTA Arad and Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti . The matches against UTA were labeled as the West Derby , due to the proximity of Timi\u0219oara and Arad . Matches against CFR Cluj , FCSB , and Universitatea Craiova also drew large crowds .",
      "After the club reincarnated as ACS Poli in 2012 , the core factions of the ultras movement decided to support an alternate club in the lower leagues , ASU Politehnica Timi\u0219oara . ACS Poli struggled to fill the void created by their departure , with smaller fan factions forming to support the club . Although top-bill matches with historic rivals still attract fans to the stadium , attendances have dropped compared to the averages attained in the 2000s .",

      "Flatiron Building",
      "The Flatiron Building , originally the Fuller Building , is a triangular 22-story , steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the eponymous Flatiron District neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan , New York City . Designed by Daniel Burnham and Frederick Dinkelberg , it was one of the tallest buildings in the city upon its 1902 completion , at 20 floors high , and one of only two skyscrapers north of 14th Street \u2013 the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower , one block east . The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue , Broadway , and East 22nd Street \u2013 where the buildings back end is located \u2013 with East 23rd Street grazing the triangles northern ( uptown ) peak . As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings , the name Flatiron derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron .",
      "The building , which has been called one of the worlds most iconic skyscrapers and a quintessential symbol of New York City , anchors the south ( downtown ) end of Madison Square and the north ( uptown ) end of the Ladies Mile Historic District . The neighborhood around it is called the Flatiron District after its signature building , which has become an icon of New York City . The Flatiron Building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966 , was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989 .",
      "History .",
      "Site .",
      "The site on which the Flatiron Building would stand was bought in 1857 by Amos Eno , who shortly built the Fifth Avenue Hotel on a site diagonally across from it . Eno tore down the four-story St . Germaine Hotel on the south end of the lot , and replaced it with a seven-story apartment building , the Cumberland . On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use . This left four stories of the Cumberlands northern face exposed , which Eno rented out to advertisers , including The New York Times , which installed a sign made up of electric lights . Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall , and projected images onto it from a magic lantern on top of one of his smaller buildings , presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately . Both the Times and the New York Tribune began using the screen for news bulletins , and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square , waiting for the latest results .",
      "During his life Eno resisted suggestions to sell Enos flatiron , as the site had become known , but after his death in 1899 his assets were liquidated , and the lot went up for sale . The New York State Assembly appropriated $3 million for the city to buy it , but this fell through when a newspaper reporter discovered that the plan was a graft scheme by Tammany Hall boss Richard Croker . Instead , the lot was bought at auction by William Eno , one of Amoss sons , for $690,000 \u2013 the elder Eno had bought the property for around $30,000 forty years earlier . Three weeks later , William re-sold the lot to Samuel and Mott Newhouse for $801,000 . The Newhouses intended to put up a 12-story building with street-level retail shops and bachelor apartments above , but two years later they sold the lot for about $2 million to Cumberland Realty Company , an investment partnership created by Harry S . Black , CEO of the Fuller Company . The Fuller Company was the first true general contractor that dealt with all aspects of building construction except design , and they specialized in building skyscrapers .",
      "Black intended to construct a new headquarters building on the site , despite the recent deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood , and he engaged Chicago architect Daniel Burnham to design it . The building , which would be Burnhams first in New York City , would also be the first skyscraper north of 14th Street . It was to be named the Fuller Building after George A . Fuller , founder of the Fuller Company and father of the skyscraper , who had died two years earlier . However , locals persisted in calling it The Flatiron , a name which has since been made official .",
      "Construction .",
      "Once construction of the building began , it proceeded at a very fast pace . The steel was so meticulously pre-cut that the frame went up at the rate of a floor each week . By February 1902 the frame was complete , and by mid-May the building was half-covered by terra-cotta tiling . The building was completed in June 1902 , after a year of construction .",
      "The Flatiron Building was not the first building of its triangular ground-plan : aside from a possibly unique triangular Roman temple built on a similarly constricted site in the city of Verulamium , Britannia ; Casa Saccabarozzi , Turin , Italy ( 1840 ) ; Bridge House , Leeds , England ( 1875 ) ; the Maryland Inn in Annapolis ( 1782 ) ; the Granger Block in Syracuse , New York ( 1869 ) ; the Phelan Building in San Francisco ( 1881 ) ; the Gooderham Building of Toronto ( 1892 ) ; and the English-American Building in Atlanta ( 1897 ) predate it . All , however , are smaller than their New York counterpart .",
      "Two features were added to the Flatiron Building following its completion . The cowcatcher retail space at the front of the building was added in order to maximize the use of the buildings lot and produce some retail income . Harry Black had insisted on the space , despite objections from Burnham . Another addition to the building not in the original plan was the penthouse , which was constructed after the rest of the building had been completed to be used as artists studios , and was quickly rented out to artists such as Louis Fancher , many of whom contributed to the pulp magazines which were produced in the offices below .",
      "Initial response .",
      "The Flatiron Building became an icon of New York City , and the public response to it was enthusiastic , but the critical response to it at the time was not completely positive , and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of the engineering involved . Montgomery Schuyler , editor of Architectural Record , said that its awkwardness [ is ] entirely undisguised , and without even an attempt to disguise them , if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment . .. . The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation . He praised the surface of the building , and the detailing of the terra-cotta work , but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building : [ The tenant ] can , perhaps , find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows , with light close in front of him and close behind him and close on one side of him . But suppose he needed a bookcase ? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions . But for the transaction of business ?",
      "When the building was first constructed , it received mixed feedback . The most known criticism received was known as Burnhams Folly . This criticism , focused on the structure of the building , was made on the grounds that the combination of triangular shape and height would cause the building to fall down . Critics believed that the building created a dangerous wind-tunnel at the intersection of the two streets , and could possibly knock the building down . Although the wind is strong at the intersection , the buildings structure was meant to accommodate four times the typical wind loads in order to stabilize and retain the buildings iconic triangular shape .",
      "The New York Tribune called the new building A stingy piece of pie .. . the greatest inanimate troublemaker in New York , while the Municipal Art Society said that it was Unfit to be in the Center of the City . The New York Times called it a monstrosity . But some saw the building differently . Futurist H . G . Wells wrote in his 1906 book The Future in America : A Search After Realities :",
      "I found myself agape , admiring a sky-scraper the prow of the Flat-iron Building , to be particular , ploughing up through the traffic of Broadway and Fifth Avenue in the afternoon light .",
      "The Flatiron was to attract the attention of numerous artists . It was the subject of one of Edward Steichens atmospheric photographs , taken on a wet wintry late afternoon in 1904 , as well as a memorable image by Alfred Stieglitz taken the year before , to which Steichen was paying homage . ( See below ) Stieglitz reflected on the dynamic symbolism of the building , noting upon seeing it one day during a snowstorm that .. . it appeared to be moving toward me like the bow of a monster ocean steamer \u2013 a picture of a new America still in the making , and remarked that what the Parthenon was to Athens , the Flatiron was to New York . When Stieglitzs photograph was published in Camera Work , his friend Sadakichi Hartmann , a writer , painter and photographer , accompanied it with an essay on the building : A curious creation , no doubt , but can it be called beautiful ? Beauty is a very abstract idea .. . Why should the time not arrive when the majority without hesitation will pronounce the Flat-iron a thing of beauty ?",
      "Besides Stieglitz and Steichen , photographers such as Alvin Langdon Coburn , Jessie Tarbox Beals , painters of the Ashcan School like John Sloan , Everett Shinn and Ernest Lawson , as well as Paul Cornoyer and Childe Hassam , lithographer Joseph Pennell , illustrator John Edward Jackson as well the French Cubist Albert Gleizes all took the Flatiron as the subject of their work . But decades after it was completed , others still could not come to terms with the building . Sculptor William Ordway Partridge remarked that it was a disgrace to our city , an outrage to our sense of the artistic , and a menace to life .",
      "Original tenants .",
      "The Fuller Company originally took the 19th floor of the building for its headquarters . In 1910 , Harry Black moved the company to Francis Kimballs Trinity Building at 111 Broadway , where its parent company , U.S . Realty , had its offices . U.S . Realty moved its offices back to the Flatiron in 1916 , and left permanently for the Fuller Building on 57th Street in 1929 .",
      "The Flatirons other original tenants included publishers ( magazine publishing pioneer Frank Munsey , American Architect and Building News and a vanity publisher ) , an insurance company ( the Equitable Life Assurance Society ) , small businesses ( a patent medicine company , Western Specialty Manufacturing Company and Whitehead & Hoag , who made celluloid novelties ) , music publishers ( overflow from Tin Pan Alley up on 28th Street ) , a landscape architect , the Imperial Russian Consulate , the Bohemian Guides Society , the Roebling Construction Company , owned by the sons of Tammany Hall boss Richard Croker , and the crime syndicate , Murder , Inc .",
      "The retail space in the buildings cowcatcher at the prow was leased by United Cigar Stores , and the buildings vast cellar , which extended into the vaults that went more than under the surrounding streets , was occupied by the Flatiron Restaurant , which could seat 1,500 patrons and was open from breakfast through late supper for those taking in a performance at one of the many theatres which lined Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets .",
      "In 1911 , the building introduced a restaurant/club in the basement . It was among the first of its kind that allowed a black jazz band to perform , thus introducing ragtime to affluent New Yorkers .",
      "Even before construction on the Flatiron Building had begun , the area around Madison Square had started to deteriorate somewhat . After U.S . Realty constructed the New York Hippodrome , Madison Square Garden was no longer the venue of choice , and survived largely by staging boxing matches . The base of the Flatiron became a cruising spot for gay men , including some male prostitutes . Nonetheless , in 1911 the Flatiron Restaurant was bought by Louis Bustanoby , of the well-known Caf\u00e9 des Beaux-Arts , and converted into a trendy 400-seat French restaurant , Taverne Louis . As an innovation to attract customers away from another restaurant opened by his brothers , Bustanoby hired a black musical group , Louis Mitchell and his Southern Symphony Quintette , to play dance tunes at the Taverne and the Caf\u00e9 . Irving Berlin heard the group at the Taverne and suggested that they should try to get work in London , which they did . The Tavernes openness was also indicated by its welcoming a gay clientele , unusual for a restaurant of its type at the time . The Taverne was forced to close due to the effects of Prohibition on the restaurant business .",
      "Sales and new tenants .",
      "In October 1925 , Harry S . Black , in need of cash for his U.S . Realty Company , sold the Flatiron Building to a syndicate set up by Lewis Rosenbaum , who also owned assorted other notable buildings around the U.S . The price was $2 million , which equaled Blacks cost for buying the lot and erecting the Flatiron . The syndicate defaulted on its mortgage in 1933 , and was taken over by the lender , Equitable Life Assurance Company after failing to sell it at auction . To attract tenants , Equitable did some modernization of the building , including replacing the original cast-iron birdcage elevators , which had cabs covered in rubber tiling and were originally built by Hecla Iron Works , but the hydraulic power system was not replaced . By the mid-1940s , the building was fully rented .",
      "When the U.S . entered World War I , the Federal government instituted a Wake Up America ! campaign , and the United Cigar store in the Flatirons cowcatcher donated its space to the U.S . Navy for use as a recruiting center . Liberty Bonds were sold outside on sidewalk stands . By the mid-1940s , the cigar store had been replaced with a Walgreens drug store . During the 1940s , the building was dominated by clothing and toy companies .",
      "Equitable sold the building in 1946 to the Flatiron Associates , an investor group headed by Harry Helmsley , whose firm , Dwight-Helmsley ( which would later become Helmsley-Spear ) managed the property . The new owners made some superficial changes , such as adding a dropped ceiling to the lobby , and , later , replacing the original mahogany-panelled entrances with revolving doors .",
      "In 1959 , St . Martins Press moved into the building , and gradually its parent company , Macmillan , rented other offices as they became available , until by 2004 , all 21 floors of the Flatiron Buildings office space was rented by Macmillan . During its tenancy , Macmillan renovated some of the Flatiron Buildings floors . for its imprints such as Tor/Forge , Picador and Henry Holt and Company . Macmillan , which is owned by Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck of Stuttgart , Germany , wrote about the building :",
      "The Flatirons interior is known for having its strangely-shaped offices with walls that cut through at an angle on their way to the skyscrapers famous point . These point offices are the most coveted and feature amazing northern views that look directly upon another famous Manhattan landmark , the Empire State Building .",
      "Because the Helmsley/Flatiron Associates ownership structure was a tenancy-in-common , in which all partners have to agree on any action , as opposed to a straightforward partnership , it was difficult to get permission for necessary repairs and improvements to be done , and the building declined during the Helmsley/Flatiron Associates era . The facade of the Flatiron Building was restored in 1991 by the firm of Hurley & Farinella . Helmsley-Spear stopped managing the building in 1997 , when some of the investors sold their 52% of the building to Newmark Knight-Frank , a large real estate firm , which took over management of the property . Shortly afterwards , Helmsleys widow , Leona Helmsley , sold her share as well . Newmark made significant improvements to the property , including installing new electric elevators , replacing the antiquated hydraulic ones , which were the last hydraulic elevators in New York City .",
      "21st century .",
      "During a 2005 restoration of the Flatiron Building a 15-story vertical advertising banner covered the facade of the building . The advertisement elicited protests from many New York City residents , prompting the New York City Department of Buildings to step in and force the buildings owners to remove it .",
      "In January 2009 , Italian real estate investment firm Sorgente Group , based in Rome , bought a majority stake in the Flatiron Building , with plans to turn it into a luxury hotel . The firms Historic and Trophy Buildings Fund owns a number of prestigious buildings in France and Italy , and was involved in buying , and then selling , a stake in the Chrysler Building in Midtown New York . The value of the 22-story Flatiron Building , which is already zoned by the city to allow it to become a hotel , was estimated to be $190 million .",
      "In July 2017 , Macmillan announced that it was consolidating all of its New York offices to the Equitable Building at 120 Broadway . By June 2019 , Macmillan had left the building , and all 21 office floors were vacant . Following MacMillans departure , the owners of the Flatiron Building , the family-owned GFP Real Estate , planned to use the absence of tenants to upgrade the interior of the building . GFP planned to install a central air and heating system , strip away all interior partitions \u2013 leaving triangular open floors \u2013 put in a new sprinkler system and a second staircase , and upgrade the elevators . The lobby would also be renovated . The cost would be $60\u201380 million and the project was estimated to take a year . The owners were interested in renting the entire building to a single tenant , and hired a high-profile real estate agency to find the right company for the building . The executive director of the ownership company said that The building was born as a commercial property , and we want to keep it as such .",
      "Design .",
      "The Flatiron Building was designed by Chicagos Daniel Burnham as a vertical Renaissance palazzo with Beaux-Arts styling . Unlike New Yorks early skyscrapers , which took the form of towers arising from a lower , blockier mass , such as the contemporary Singer Building ( built 1902\u201308 ) , the Flatiron Building epitomizes the Chicago school conception . Like a classical Greek column , its facade \u2013 limestone at the bottom changing to glazed terra-cotta from the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company in Tottenville , Staten Island as the floors rise \u2013 is divided into a base , shaft , and capital .",
      "Early sketches by Daniel Burnham show a design with an ( unexecuted ) clockface and a far more elaborate crown than in the actual building . Though Burnham maintained overall control of the design process , he was not directly connected with the details of the structure as built . That task was performed by his designer Frederick P . Dinkelberg , a Pennsylvania-born architect in Burnhams office , who first worked for Burnham in putting together the 1893 Worlds Columbian Exposition in Chicago , for which Burnham was the chief of construction and master designer . Working drawings for the Flatiron Building , however , remain to be located , though renderings were published at the time of construction in American Architect and Architectural Record .",
      "Steel skeleton .",
      "Building the Flatiron was made feasible by a change to New York Citys building codes in 1892 , which eliminated the requirement that masonry be used for fireproofing considerations . This opened the way for steel-skeleton construction . Since it employed a steel skeleton \u2013 with the steel coming from the American Bridge Company in Pennsylvania \u2013 it could be built to 22 stories ( 285 feet ) relatively easily , which would have been difficult using other construction methods of that time . It was a technique familiar to the Fuller Company , a contracting firm with considerable expertise in building such tall structures . At the vertex , the triangular tower is only 6.5 feet ( 2 m ) wide ; viewed from above , this pointed end of the structure describes an acute angle of about 25 degrees .",
      "Purdy and Henderson were the structural engineers . They strengthened the structure to deal with the wind load , as the building was quite narrow and therefore had less volume to resist it . They designed it so that , in theory , the building would turn compactly before any failure could occur in the metal structure . For the first time the construction of a skyscraper steel structure could be witnessed in full by the public , an event that received a great response and was immortalized by photographers Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz .",
      "Design features .",
      "The cowcatcher retail space at the front of the building was not part of Burnham or Dinkelbergs design , but was added at the insistence of Harry Black in order to maximize the use of the buildings lot and produce some retail income to help defray the cost of construction . Black pushed Burnham hard for plans for the addition , but Burnham resisted because of the aesthetic effect it would have on the design of the prow of the building , where it would interrupt the two-story high Classical columns which were echoed at the top of the building by two columns which supported the cornice . Black insisted , and Burnham was forced to accept the addition , despite the interruption of the designs symmetry .",
      "The building was considered to be quirky overall , with drafty wood-framed and cooper-clad windows , no central air conditioning , a heating system which utilized cast-iron radiators , an antiquated sprinkler system , and a single staircase should evacuation of the building be necessary . The triangular shape of the structure led to a rabbit warren of oddly-shaped rooms . Other oddities about the buildings interior include that bathrooms for males and females are placed on alternating floors , with the mens rooms on even floors and the womens rooms on odd ones . Additionally , to reach the top floor \u2013 the 21st , which was added in 1905 , three years after the building was completed \u2013 a second elevator has to be taken from the 20th floor . On the 21st floor , the bottoms of the windows are chest-high .",
      "Influence .",
      "As an icon of New York City , the exterior of the Flatiron Building remains a popular spot for tourist photographs , making it possibly one of the most photographed buildings in the world .",
      "23 skidoo .",
      "When construction on the building began , locals took an immediate interest , placing bets on how far the debris would spread when the wind knocked it down . This presumed susceptibility to damage had also given it the nickname Burnhams Folly . But thanks to the steel bracing designed by engineer Corydon Purdy , which enabled the building to withstand four times the amount of wind force it could ever be expected to endure , there was no possibility that the wind would knock over the Flatiron Building . Nevertheless , the wind was a factor in the public attention the building received .",
      "Due to the geography of the site , with Broadway on one side , Fifth Avenue on the other , and the open expanse of Madison Square and the park in front of it , the wind currents around the building could be treacherous . Wind from the north would split around the building , downdrafts from above and updrafts from the vaulted area under the street would combine to make the wind unpredictable . This is said to have given rise to the phrase 23 skidoo , from what policemen would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of womens dresses being blown up by the winds swirling around the building due to the strong downdrafts .",
      "In popular culture .",
      "In the 1958 comedy film Bell , Book and Candle , James Stewart and Kim Novak were filmed on top of the Flatiron Building in a romantic clinch , and for Warren Beattys 1980 film Reds , the base of the building was used for a scene with Diane Keaton .",
      "Today , the Flatiron Building is frequently used in television commercials and documentaries as an easily recognizable symbol of the city , shown , for instance , in the opening credits of the Late Show with David Letterman or in scenes of New York City that are shown during scene transitions in the TV sitcoms Friends , Spin City , and Veronicas Closet . In 1987 , the building was used as the scene of a murder for the TV series Murder , She Wrote , in the episode No Accounting for Murder . In the 1998 film Godzilla , the Flatiron Building is accidentally destroyed by the US Army while in pursuit of Godzilla . It is depicted as the headquarters of the Daily Bugle , for which Peter Parker is a freelance photographer , in Sam Raimis Spider-Man trilogy , and once again in The Spectacular Spider-Man animated series . It is shown as the location of the Channel 6 News headquarters where April ONeil works in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV series . The Flatiron Building is also the home of the fictional company Damage Control in the Marvel Universe comics and for the CIA-sponsored superhero management team The Boys in the Dynamite Comics title of the same name .",
      "In 2013 , the Whitney Museum of American Art installed a life-sized 3D-cutout replica of Edward Hoppers 1942 painting Nighthawks in the Flatiron Art Space located in the prow of the Flatiron building . Although Hopper said his picture was inspired by a diner in Greenwich Village , the prow is reminiscent of the painting , and was selected to display the two-dimensional cutouts .",
      "In 2014 , the Lego Architecture series produced a model of the Flatiron Building to add to their landmark series . The subsequent New York City set , introduced in 2015 , also included the building ."

      "44 Union Square",
      "44 Union Square , also known as 100 East 17th Street and the Tammany Hall Building , is a three-story building at 44 Union Square East in Union Square , Manhattan , in New York City . It is at the southeast corner of Union Square East/Park Avenue South and East 17th Street . The neo-Georgian structure was erected in 1928\u20131929 and designed by architects Thompson , Holmes & Converse and Charles B . Meyers for the Tammany Society political organization , also known as Tammany Hall . It is the organizations oldest surviving headquarters building .",
      "The Tammany Society had relocated to 44 Union Square from a previous headquarters on nearby 14th Street . At the time of the buildings commission , the society was at its maximum political popularity with members such as U.S . senator Robert F . Wagner , governor Al Smith , and mayor Jimmy Walker . However , after Tammany Hall lost its influence in the 1930s , the building was sold to an affiliate of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in 1943 . By the 1980s , it was used by the Union Square Theatre , while the New York Film Academy took space in 1994 . The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as a city landmark in 2013 , and it was converted into an office and retail structure during a renovation that took place between 2016 and 2020 .",
      "History .",
      "Context .",
      "By the first decade of the 20th century , Union Square in Manhattan had grown into a major transportation hub with several elevated and surface railroad lines running nearby , and the New York City Subways 14th Street\u2013Union Square station having opened four years prior . The area had also become a major wholesaling district with several loft buildings , as well as numerous office buildings . The office structures included the Everett Building , erected at the northwest corner of Park Avenue South and 17th Street in 1908 ; the Germania Life Insurance Company Building , erected at the northeast corner of the same intersection in 1910\u20131911 ; and the Consolidated Gas Building ( later Consolidated Edison Building ) , constructed three blocks south at 14th Street between 1910 and 1914 . By the 1920s , the remaining buildings in Union Square were occupied by theaters , while most buildings on the eastern part of the square were owned by department stores S . Klein and Ohrbachs .",
      "The previous headquarters of Tammany Hall , a prominent Democratic Party political organization in New York City , had been located on 14th Street next to the Consolidated Gas Building . The organization\u2014named after Tamanend , the chief of the Lenape who originally occupied New York City\u2014extensively used Native American titles and terminology , for instance referring to their headquarters as a wigwam . After the expansion of the Consolidated Gas building was announced in 1926 , the old Tammany Hall wigwam was sold to J . Clarence Davis and Joseph P . Day , of real estate syndicate D&D Company , on December 6 , 1927 . D&D Company sold the old wigwam again to Consolidated Gas in January 1928 . There were allegations that Tammany leaders profited from the sale of the headquarters , which Tammany leader George Washington Olvany denied . Day , a long-time member of Tammany Hall , eventually agreed to give the $70,000 profit from the sale ( ) to Tammany .",
      "Construction .",
      "One week after the sale of the old wigwam , Tammany purchased a site nearby , at 44 Union Square East near the southwest corner with Park Avenue South and East 17th Street . Olvany announced the sale on December 14 , 1927 . As originally proposed , the Tammany Hall Building was an American colonial style building , measuring on 17th Street by on Union Square East , with storefronts on the ground floor and a 1,200-seat auditorium . At the time of the announcement , the societys members included state senators Robert F . Wagner and Al Smith : the former would become U.S . senator for New York , while the latter would become the states governor and 1932 presidential candidate . According to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission , the old headquarters was associated with the societys corrupt past under William M . Boss Tweed , while the new headquarters construction represented its future and an opportunity for Smith .",
      "In January 1928 , a month after the purchase of the site , Charles B . Meyers was selected along with Thompson , Holmes & Converse as the buildings architects . The plans were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings that April . Tammany Hall remained in its old headquarters until July 4 , 1928 , so it could celebrate the U.S . Independence Day at that location . Immediately afterward , it moved to a temporary space at 2 Park Avenue . Construction progressed quickly , without any cornerstone-laying ceremony to mark the start of work , and by December much of the structure was substantially complete . The New York County Democratic Committee , a club for Democratic officials representing New York County ( Manhattan ) , started using the new structure on January 2 , 1929 , and the ceremonial cornerstone was laid the next week , marking the completion of the facade .",
      "Tammany and union uses .",
      "The wigwam at 44 Union Square was finished by early July 1929 . A dedication celebration was held on July 4 , 1929 . Governor Franklin D . Roosevelt and former governor Smith spoke at the dedication . The structure had cost $350,000 to erect ( ) . Shortly after , during the early 1930s , Tammany Hall started to lose its political influence . Although Roosevelt was also a Democrat , he did not regard the organization highly , opening several corruption investigations into the organization . Roosevelts election to U.S . president in 1933 , as well as the election of Republican mayoral candidate Fiorello H . La Guardia the same year , contributed to the downfall of the Tammany Society .",
      "By the early 1940s , the Tammany Society could no longer afford to maintain its wigwam . Local 91 , a local affiliate of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union ( ILGWU ) , was simultaneously looking for a new headquarters and offered to purchase the structure in April 1943 . The sale was finalized that September . Tammanys leaders moved to the National Democratic Club on Madison Avenue at East 33rd Street , and the Societys collection of memorabilia went into a warehouse in the Bronx . The New York County Democratic Committee , meanwhile , moved to other quarters in Midtown Manhattan . The ILGWU enlarged the stage and furnished the offices , officially rededicating the building on December 18 , 1943 , at an event with several leaders including mayors La Guardia and Jimmy Walker . Upon completion of renovation , the ILGWU opened meeting spaces , offices , art studios , and classrooms in the former Tammany building .",
      "44 Union Squares auditorium was renamed for the late president Roosevelt in 1947 . The Roosevelt Auditorium was used often for other unions events . For instance , in the 1950s the auditorium was used for meetings of firefighters ; gardeners , municipal laborers , and sewage workers ; and sanitation workers . The United Federation of Teachers held meetings at the Roosevelt Auditorium in 1960 to resolve a citywide teachers strike , and again in October 1968 to approve the Ocean Hill/Brownsville teachers strike . Additionally , several unions in the private sector often met at the Roosevelt Auditorium , such as those of newspaper delivery people ; drivers of taxicabs in fleets ; hospital workers ; and Teamsters unions . In 1969 , the auditorium was also the location of a high-profile disagreement between two Central Labor Council leaders , who endorsed opposing candidates in the 1969 New York City mayoral election . By the 1980s , the ILGWUs membership had decreased because of an exodus of garment manufacturers in New York City .",
      "Performing arts uses .",
      "At a premiere event for Harold Pinters play Old Times , ILGWU executive vice president Wilbur Daniels had a chance encounter with Gene Feist , co-founder of Roundabout Theatre Company . After Feist mentioned that the lease theaters premises at 23rd Street was about to expire , Local 91 leased 44 Union Square to Roundabout in June 1984 . As part of the $850,000 renovation ( ) , the theater was split in half from west to east , reducing its capacity to 499 seats . The stage was expanded , while the balcony and the orchestra were also refurbished . Though the renovated theater was originally slated to open in late 1984 , the conversion of the space was delayed by several months . The first performance took place within the space on February 1 , 1985 . After Roundabouts lease ran out in 1990 , it moved to the Criterion Theater in Times Square .",
      "44 Union Square was then leased in June 1994 by Alan Schuster and Mitchell Maxwell , who also operated the Minetta Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village . In preparation for converting the space for use by the Union Square Theatre , Schuster and Maxwell renovated the interior , painting the dome a sky-blue hue , and replacing the seats upholstery with burgundy materials . The building started housing the New York Film Academy in July 1994 , and the Union Square Theatre held its first performance in the space that November . The Liberty Theatres , a subsidiary of the Reading Company , operated the Union Square Theatre . In 2001 Liberty Theatres bought the structure from the ILGWU . The air rights above the building were sold to another Reading Company subsidiary in 2005 , giving the company the right to theoretically erect another structure above 44 Union Square .",
      "Landmark status and redevelopment .",
      "Though preservationists had been advocating for the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission ( LPC ) to designate 44 Union Square an official city landmark since the 1980s , the ILGWU had been indifferent toward landmark status . When Liberty Theatres bought the building , preservationists hoped that the company would be more receptive toward landmark status . However , the effort stalled for several years . The LPC designated it as a city landmark in October 2013 , following public meetings held to gauge opinion for the designation , in which 17 people expressed support and no one expressed opposition .",
      "In the early 2010s Liberty Theatres announced its plans to refurbish the Tammany Hall Building . As part of the renovation , a glass dome was to be added to the building , though these plans were denied by the LPC in 2014 . The following year , a scaled-back version of the glass dome was approved by the commission . The New York Film Academy moved out in late 2015 , and all existing tenants were evicted the next year . The $50 million renovation project , designed by BKSK Architects , began in July 2016 . The auditorium was demolished to make way for retail and office space . The renovation of the structure , renamed 44 Union Square , was supposed to be completed in 2018 . By February 2019 , the glass dome was under construction and the renovation was slated to be completed that year . The dome was structurally completed in July 2019 , and work was substantially completed by July 2020 . Prospective tenant Slack Technologies , which was slated to take all the space in 2019 , ultimately withdrew from the project in early 2020 .",
      "Design .",
      "44 Union Square , a -story neo-Georgian building , is the oldest surviving wigwam of the Tammany Society . It measures on its western facade along Union Square East , and on its northern facade along 17th Street . The particular neo-Georgian features in the Tammany Hall Building include Flemish bond brickwork ; rectangular windows with stone keystones , set in arched openings ; and wrought-iron balconies . The facades along Union Square East and on 17th Street are both arranged to give the appearance of symmetry . The bracketed gable , on the pediment above the portico , is not of neo-Georgian design but was likely inspired by a niche on the facade of the 14th Street building .",
      "The exterior design features are evocative of government buildings in the American colonial and Federal styles that were built in the later 19th century , when the society was founded . These features include a first level above a raised basement ; a portico on Union Square East , with a pediment supported by columns in the Doric order ; a hip roof ; and a frieze running along the top of the structure . According to a commemorative publication from the Tammany Society , these features were inspired by the design of Federal Hall in Lower Manhattan , as well as by Somerset House in London . The Tammany Hall Building was one of several structures built in New York City in the early 20th century whose designs were inspired by government buildings . Other such structures included The Town Hall near Times Square , the Museum of the City of New York on the Upper East Side , and the original Staten Island Museum building in St . George .",
      "Facade .",
      "The facade consists of limestone at the basement and first level . and English red brick on the second story and above . The Old Virginia Brick Company , who created the exterior brick , said in an advertisement that the hardiness of the brick , in conjunction with the softening and toning down of the limestone , would turn the building into an enduring symbol of New York Citys historic yester-years .",
      "On Union Square East , within the center of the first floor , was the entrance to the commercial space on the first floor . The commercial space is located below a second-floor balcony . The balcony is located in the center of the facade , below the pedimented portico . In the round-arched gable of the pediment , above the portico , there is a panel depicting arrows intertwined with an olive branch , which flank Tammany Halls circular logo .",
      "On 17th Street , there is a set of triple arches in the center of the first floor , which originally provided egress from the buildings auditorium . The main entrance to the theater and elevator lobby was located to the right ( west ) side of the arches , and a similar arch grouping was located to the left ( east ) . Above the first floor , in the center of the building , is an inscription reading 1786 THE SOCIETY OF TAMMANY OR COLUMBIAN ORDER 1928 .",
      "Features .",
      "According to a book published by the Tammany Society in 1936 , the western half of the building contained various offices . The Tammany Society had exclusive use of the third floor , which included a central lounge , a club room , office and meeting rooms , and various waiting rooms . The Democratic County Committee was located on the second floor . The first floor was occupied by commercial space . Starting in 2016 , the basement , first , and second floors were being renovated into of retail space .",
      "The eastern half of the building was occupied by the 1,200-seat auditorium , which took up the first to third floors . In the basement below the auditorium was a waiting room , accessed from an elevator lobby . Stairways led to the second-floor balcony . The auditorium was demolished in 2016 to make way for of office space . With the dome , the ceiling heights on the fifth floor range between while the sixth floor has a ceiling height of up to .",
      "Critical reception .",
      "Early architectural critics lauded the Tammany Hall Building as a paragon of the neo-Georgian style in New York City . The Real Estate Record & Guide said that the severe Colonial columns placed at the center of both facades contributed to the buildings dignified architectural treatment . The Architecture & Building magazine said that the structure was well proportioned . George Shepard Chappell , writing in The New Yorker under the pseudonym T-Square , praised the Tammany Hall Buildings exceptionally charming design , saying that it was a real adornment to Union Square ."

      "Healy Hall",
      "Healy Hall is a National Historic Landmark and the flagship building of the main campus of Georgetown University in Washington , D.C . Constructed between 1877 and 1879 , the hall was designed by Paul J . Pelz and John L . Smithmeyer , prominent architects who also built the Library of Congress . The structure was named after Patrick Francis Healy , who was the President of Georgetown University at the time .",
      "Healy Hall serves as the main administrative and reception venue of Georgetown , with some portions still being used as classrooms . The building includes Riggs Library , one of the few extant cast iron libraries in the nation , as well as the elaborate Gaston Hall .",
      "History .",
      "Motivation .",
      "In 1873 , Patrick Francis Healy became the president of Georgetown University . Soon after entering office , he articulated to the Superior General of the Jesuit order , Peter Jan Beckx , his vision of transforming Georgetown from a college into a true university . This coincided with prominent Catholics calling for the creation of a great Catholic university in the United States , on par with other large American universities established around this time . Healys transformation involved broadening the schools curriculum and raising the standards of the Law School and School of Medicine . Both Healy and the provincial superior of the Jesuits Maryland Province , Joseph Keller , agreed in 1874 that the schools most pressing need was to expand its physical facilities .",
      "The two planned for the construction of several new buildings , which would contain classrooms , laboratories , a library , a chapel , and a dormitory for the older students . However , Beckx withheld approval of any new construction until Healy could demonstrate that Georgetown had the means to finance such a project . As time passed , the initial plan for several new buildings developed into a plan to build one grand building .",
      "Construction .",
      "Healy initially consulted Patrick C . Keely , a church architect from New York , about designing the new building . However , he decided it was better to hire an architect closer to Georgetown , and in fall 1874 , he selected John L . Smithmeyer and his associate , Paul J . Pelz , who would later design the Library of Congress Building . Smithmeyer , who was the chief architect , designed the plan and elevations of the structure , while Pelz designed its porches and interior rooms , including Gaston Hall , Riggs Library , and the parlors . Healy chose a site located between Old North and the Preparatory Building , now known as Maguire Hall . This was the first building on Georgetowns campus that would face the city of Washington , rather than the Potomac River .",
      "Plans for the building were first submitted in December 1875 . Keller objected to the construction of a single , large building because it would have lacked sufficient dormitory space for the Jesuit scholastics , who he sought to relocate from Woodstock College to Georgetown . However , Keller acquiesced to Healys plan in May 1876 . The designs were tweaked before being sent to the Superior General in Rome for approval in January 1877 . They called for a building measuring in length and in width . Beckx considered the planned building too large and ornate , and thought the projected cost was an underestimate . Nonetheless , he approved the project that year , on the condition that total expenses not exceed $100,000 , equivalent to $ in .",
      "In April 1877 , ground was broken on the foundation , which was completed in October .",
      "The construction of the building , from 1877 to 1879 , dramatically increased the amount of classroom and living space\u2014at the time , it was also used as a dormitory\u2014of what was then a small liberal arts college . Prior to its construction , Old North housed most of the colleges classrooms , dormitories , and other facilities . The construction also left the university deeply in debt and in possession for years of an enormous pile of dirt as a result of the excavation , with no funds to remove it . As a result of the debts , the Gaston Hall auditorium could not be completed until 1909 .",
      "The building was listed on District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1964 , on the National Register of Historic Places on May 25 , 1971 , and as a National Historic Landmark on December 23 , 1987 . In addition , it is a contributing property of the Georgetown Historic District , which was listed as a National Historic Landmark District on May 28 , 1967 .",
      "The building was brought to national attention in 1973 when it acted as a prominent background for the film The Exorcist . In 1990 the interior hall and also the second story of the building featured in The Exorcist III .",
      "Architecture .",
      "The architecture of Healy Hall has been described as both Neo-Romanesque and High Victorian Gothic in style . Of this latter style , it is considered one of the last large scale examples in the United States .",
      "Built in a Neo-Medieval style that combines elements of Romanesque , Early Gothic , Late Gothic and Early Renaissance , the building contains the Office of the President ; Georgetowns Department of Classics ; the Kennedy Institute of Ethics ; and the Bioethics Research Library .",
      "Notable rooms in Healy include Riggs Library , one of the few extant cast iron libraries in the nation ; the Philodemic Room , the meeting room for the Philodemic Society , one of the oldest collegiate debating clubs in the nation ; the grand Hall of Cardinals ; the historic Constitution Room ; and the Carroll Parlor , which houses several notable pieces from the universitys art collection .",
      "Perhaps the grandest space in the building is Gaston Hall , Georgetowns Jewel in the Crown , the 750-seat auditorium which has played host to multitudes of world leaders . Gaston Hall , located on the third and fourth floors and named for Georgetowns first student , William Gaston , is decorated with the coats of arms of the Jesuit colleges and universities and rich allegorical scenes painted by notable Jesuit artist Brother Francis C . Schroen . Schroen also created the intricate paintings found in the Carroll Parlor and on the ceiling of the Bioethics Reference Centers Hirst Reading Room .",
      "Healy Hall rises to a height of , making it the tied with 700 Eleventh Street as the sixth tallest building in Washington , D.C .",
      "Clock hands .",
      "The hands of the Healy Clock Tower have been subjected to many thefts , as per the university tradition . Historically , students would steal the hands and mail them to the person they wished to visit the campus , most notably sent to the Vatican , where they were blessed by Pope John Paul II and then returned to the university . One such incident caused significant damage to the clock mechanism , however , and security has been increased as a result in recent years , decreasing the incidence of the theft . These measures have not prevented students from successfully obtaining the hands however , as they are captured every five to six years , such as in the fall of 2005 by Drew Hamblen ( SFS \u201907 ) and Wyatt Gjullin ( COL \u201909 ) . The hands were stolen once again during the evening between April 29 and April 30 , 2012 , and supposedly sent to Barack Obama but the hands ended up lost in the mail . More recently , the clock hands were stolen during the evening between December 9th and December 10th , 2014 , and again sometime during the night of April 30 , 2017 .",
      "Dean M . Carignan ( SFS 91 ) has written of his stealing the clock hands during his freshman year . On April 1 , 1988 , Carignan and a fellow student accessed the clock through a metal plate set into the roof at the base of the clocktower . Eventually tracked down by campus security , Carignan and his Georgetown accomplice were sentenced by a university discipline panel to an $800 fine , a 40-hour work sanction , [ and ] a year of probation .",
      "The writer Joseph Bottum has also published an account of stealing the clock hands . In the Fall of 1977 , Bottum joined Stan DeTurris , Dave Barry , and Pat Conway ( all freshmen in the class of \u201981 ) to climb through a trap door on the north peak of Healy , above Gaston Hall , and steal the hands from the east face of the clock , returning them at the end of the school year to the university president , Fr . Timothy Healy , S.J . The next year , Bottum writes , he and DeTurris found another way into the attics of Healy Hall , crawling through the ducts above Riggs Library to steal the minute hands from both the east and west clock faces .",
      "Riggs Library .",
      "Riggs Library was the main library of Georgetown University from 1891 to 1970 , until being replaced by Lauinger Library . It is housed in the south tower of Healy Hall , on the third floor . Riggs Library is one of the few extant cast-iron libraries in the nation . The library still serves its original function of storing books despite its primary use as a formal event space . The librarys construction was funded by E . Francis Riggs as a memorial to his father and brother , and was supervised by architect Paul Pelz , who designed Healy Hall and the Library of Congress , although Riggs did not open until a full decade after Healy Hall opened for use ."

      "Chelyabinsk ( ) is a city and the administrative center of Chelyabinsk Oblast , Russia . It is the seventh-largest city in Russia by population , with 1,130,132 inhabitants as of the 2010 Census , and the second largest city in the Ural Federal District , after Yekaterinburg . Located in the northeast of the oblast , south of Yekaterinburg , the city is just to the east of the Ural Mountains . It sits on the Miass River , part of the border between Europe and Asia .",
      "The area of Chelyabinsk contained the ancient settlement of Arkaim , which belonged to the Sintashta culture . In 1736 , a fortress by the name of Chelyaba was founded on the site of a Bashkir village . Chelyabinsk was granted town status by 1787 . Chelyabinsk began to grow rapidly by the early 20th century as a result of the construction of railway links to European Russia and Siberia , including the Trans-Siberian Railway . Its population reached 70,000 by 1917 . Under the Soviet Union , Chelyabinsk became a major industrial centre during the 1930s . The Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant was built in 1933 . During World War II , the city was a major contributor to the manufacture of tanks and ammunition .",
      "Chelyabinsk remains an important industrial centre , especially heavy industries such as metallurgy and military production . It is home to several educational institutions , mainly South Ural State University and Chelyabinsk State University . In 2013 , the Chelyabinsk meteor exploded over the Ural Mountains , with fragments falling into and near the city . The blast of the explosion caused many hundreds of injuries , some of them serious , mostly caused by glass fragments from shattered windows . The Chelyabinsk Regional Museum contains fragments of the meteorite .",
      "History .",
      "Ancient Sintashta civilization .",
      "Archaeologists have discovered ruins of the ancient town of Arkaim in the vicinity of the city of Chelyabinsk . Ruins and artifacts in Arkaim and other sites in the region indicate a relatively advanced civilization existing in the area since the 2nd millennium BCE , which was of proto-Indo-Iranian origin .",
      "The Arkaim site , located in the Sintashta-Petrovka cultural area , was known by Russian archaeologists for at least 70 years , however it was mostly ignored by non-Russian anthropological circles . The borders of the Sintashta-Petrovka cultural area run along the eastern Urals of the Eurasian steppe to about 400 km south of Chelyabinsk and to the east for about 200 km . 23 archaeological sites are recognized as being part of this area .",
      "The sites resemble towns , laid out in round , square , or oval shapes . Although most of the sites have been discovered by aerial photography , only two , Arkaim and Sintashta , have been thoroughly excavated . These sites are characterized by their fortification , connected houses , and extensive evidence of metallurgy .",
      "The people of the Sintashta culture are thought to have spoken Proto-Indo-Iranian , the ancestor of the Indo-Iranian language family . This identification is based primarily on similarities between their language in comparison to sections of the Rigveda , and based on funerary rituals of the Sintashta culture , as revealed by archaeological studies in the area .",
      "Modern Russian history .",
      "The fortress of Chelyaba , from which the city takes its name , was founded at the location of the Bashkir village of Chelyaby ( ) by colonel Alexey ( Kutlu-Muhammed ) Tevkelev in 1736 to protect the surrounding trade routes from possible attacks by Bashkir outlaws . During Pugachevs Rebellion , the fortress withstood a siege by the rebel forces in 1774 , but was eventually captured for several months in 1775 . In 1782 , Chelyabinsk became a seat of the uyezd of Ufa Viceroyalty , which was later reformed into Orenburg Governorate . In 1787 , Chelyabinsk was granted town status by the government .",
      "Until the late 19th century , Chelyabinsk was a small provincial town . In 1892 , the Samara-Zlatoust Railway was completed , which connected it with Moscow and the rest of European Russia . Also in 1892 , construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway started from Chelyabinsk , and in 1896 , the city was linked to Ekaterinburg . Chelyabinsk then became the main hub for travel to Siberia . For fifteen years , more than fifteen million people - a tenth of Russias population at the time - passed through Chelyabinsk . Some of them remained in Chelyabinsk , which contributed to its rapid growth . In addition a so-called \u201ccustoms fracture\u201d was created in Chelyabinsk , which imposed duties on the shipment of goods between the European and Asian parts of Russia , which led to the emergence of mills and notably , a tea-packing factory . As a result , Chelyabinsk became a major trade center . Its population reached 20,000 inhabitants by 1897 , 45,000 by 1913 , and 70,000 by 1917 . Because of its rapid growth at the turn of the 20th century , similar to that of midwestern American cities , Chelyabinsk was sometimes called the Chicago of the Urals .",
      "During the first Five-Year Plans of the 1930s , Chelyabinsk experienced rapid industrial growth . Several important factories , including the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant , were built at this time . During World War II , Joseph Stalin decided to move a large part of Soviet manufacturing to areas removed from the reach of the advancing German military as part of a general exodus from western occupied areas . This brought new industries and thousands of workers to Chelyabinsk , including facilities for the production of T-34 tanks and Katyusha rocket launchers . During World War II , the citys industries produced 18,000 tanks and 48,500 tank diesel engines as well as over 17 million units of ammunition . During that time Chelyabinsk was informally called \u201cTankograd\u201d ( English : \u201cTank City\u201d ) . During World War II , the S.M . Kirov Factory no . 185 or \u201cOKMO\u201d was moved to Chelyabinsk from Leningrad to produce heavy tanks , although it was transferred to Omsk after 1962 .",
      "2013 meteor .",
      "Shortly after dawn on February 15 , 2013 , a superbolide meteor descended at over over the Ural Mountains , exploding at an altitude of .",
      "The meteor created a momentary flash as bright as the sun and generated a shock wave that injured over a thousand people . Fragments fell in and around Chelyabinsk . Interior Ministry spokesman Vadim Kolesnikov said 1,100 people had called for medical assistance following the incident , mostly for treatment of injuries from broken glass by the explosions . One woman suffered a broken spine . Kolesnikov also said about of a roof at a zinc factory had collapsed . A spokeswoman for the Emergency Ministry told the Associated Press that there was a meteor shower ; however , another ministry spokeswoman was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying it was a single meteor . The size has been estimated at diameter with a mass of 10,000 or 11,000 metric tons . The power of the explosion was about 500 kilotons of TNT ( about 1.8 PJ ) , which is 20\u201330 times more energy than was released from the atomic bomb detonated in Hiroshima . The city managed to avoid large casualties and destruction due to the high altitude of the explosion .",

      "La Fortaleza",
      "La Fortaleza ( The Fortress ) is the official residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico . It was built between 1533 and 1540 to defend the harbor of San Juan . The structure is also known as Palacio de Santa Catalina ( Santa Catalinas Palace ) . It is the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the New World . It was listed by UNESCO in 1983 as part of the World Heritage Site La Fortaleza and San Juan National Historic Site .",
      "During the 1640 reconstruction , the chapel of Santa Catalina , which originally stood outside the walls , was integrated into the walls of the structure , resulting in the alternate name Santa Catalinas Castle .",
      "The structure .",
      "La Fortaleza was the first defensive fortification built for the city of San Juan , and the first of a series of military structures built to protect the city which included the Fort San Felipe del Morro and the Fort San Crist\u00f3bal . The construction was authorized by Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor as a defense against attacks from Island Caribs and the European powers of the time .",
      "Initially , the structure consisted of four walls enclosing an interior patio with a circular tower known as the Homage Tower . From the top of the tower , the governor , following military tradition , would take oaths of fidelity at critical moments to the King and Queen of Spain . Later , a second tower named the Austral Tower was constructed .",
      "At present , the complex consists of a few attached buildings with formal living quarters in the second floor , and private quarters in the third . It overlooks the high city walls that front the bay , and within the north perimeter of the house are sheltered gardens and a swimming pool .",
      "History .",
      "Starting in 1529 , Governor La Gama petitioned the emperor on the need to build defensive fortifications , because the islands defenseless condition caused the people to emigrate . Construction started in 1533 , with the use of stone , and concluded by 1540 . Yet the fort had no guns , and Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s commented if it had been constructed by blind men could not have been located in a worse location . Yet the structure has served as the governors residence since 1544 .",
      "Since the 16th century , La Fortaleza has acted as the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico , making it the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas . On November 27 , 1822 , its traditional status as the executive mansion was made official . The fortress underwent a massive reconstruction in 1846 to change its military appearance into a palatial facade . La Fortaleza has been the residence of more than 170 governors of Puerto Rico and has hosted various dignitaries , including President John F . Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline Kennedy who stayed in La Fortaleza in 1961 . King Juan Carlos of Spain and Queen Juliana of the Netherlands are among several heads of state who have stayed in La Fortaleza . In June 2011 , U.S . President Barack Obama visited the mansion during a brief trip to the island marking the first visit of an in-office US President to the Fortaleza as well as the Island on official business since Kennedy , 50 years previously to that date . King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain also visited La Fortaleza in 2016 .",
      "La Fortaleza has been captured twice by invaders :",
      "- 1598 , George Clifford , Earl of Cumberland , attacked San Juan .",
      "- 1625 , General Boudewijn Hendrick ( Balduino Enrico ) of the Netherlands invaded the city and established himself at La Fortaleza . During the Dutch retreat , the fortress and the city were set ablaze .",
      "In 1834 , Colonel George Dawson Flinter described the fortress of Santa Catalina as having a chapel , stables and a cistern as well as an east wing with spacious apartments .",
      "According to tradition , in 1898 , just before the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish\u2013American War , the last Spanish governor of the island , Ricardo De Ortega , struck a longcase clock in La Fortaleza with his sword , stopping the clock and marking the time at which Spain lost control over Puerto Rico .",
      "On October 30 , 1950 , there was an attempt by a few nationalists to enter La Fortaleza in what is known as the San Juan Nationalist revolt , intending to attack then-governor Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn . The 5-minute shootout resulted in four Nationalists dead : Domingo Hiraldo Resto , Carlos Hiraldo Resto , Manuel Torres Medina and Ra\u00edmundo D\u00edaz Pacheco . Three of the guards of the building , among them Lorenzo Ramos , were seriously injured .",
      "On October 9 , 1960 , La Fortaleza was designated a United States National Historic Landmark .",
      "In 1983 , La Fortaleza , along with the San Juan National Historic Site , was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO .",
      "On May 26 , 2004 , a man armed with a knife entered the mansions mailroom located just outside the palace gates and took a receptionist hostage . The 2\u00bd hour stand-off ended after Governor Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n entered the building and listened as the hostage-taker read a letter .",
      "From July 13 to July 24 , 2019 , the surrounding streets around La Fortaleza were the scene of various protests as part of Telegramgate as a result of leaked messages involving Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 . As protesters continued to demand the governor to step down on July 24 , 2019 , Rossell\u00f3 announced his resignation from office , effective August 2 , 2019 .",
      "In literature .",
      "In 2011 , Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi wrote the dramatic novel United States of Banana , featuring climactic scenes of revolution at La Fortaleza ."

It aired on Rai 1 from 13 October 2003 to 17 March 2017 in the access prime time range . From 26 December 2020 , the program returned to air on Saturday between the access prime time slot and the prime time slot . It is broadcast on public broadcaster Rai 1 , and it is also shown regularly on RAI International , RAIs international television service .",
      "The show was hosted in chronological order include : Paolo Bonolis ( October 2003 \u2013 May 2005 ) , Pupo ( September 2005 \u2013 March 2006 ) , Antonella Clerici ( March \u2013 June 2006 ) , Flavio Insinna ( September 2006 \u2013 June 2008 ) , Max Giusti ( September 2008 \u2013 June 2013 ) and again Flavio Insinna ( September 2013 - 17 March 2017 ) . The re-edition of 2020 sees the conduct of Carlo Conti , who had already conducted the episode of 1 April 2015 , exchanging the management of Leredit\u00e0 , a program that he presented at that time , with Flavio Insinna , to make an April fool to viewers .",
      "Gameplay .",
      "In this Italian version , there are 20 boxes ; each person holding a box lives in and represents of one of the twenty regions of Italy .",
      "The highest prize is \u20ac500,000 , but on some occasions there is a special \u20ac1,000,000 prize . In addition to small money prizes , like \u20ac0.50 , there are three gag prizes\u2014usually items like salami , a years supply of soap , or stuffed animals like hippos and weasels ( from seasons 2006 to 2007 , a hippo prize took place instead of the \u20ac500 one ) .",
      "The box named Pacco X , and also a Pacco Y between September 2008 and June 2013 ( both meaning mystery package ) , may contain values between \u20ac0.02 and \u20ac200,000 ( see below ) .",
      "The box named Pacco Matto ( crazy box , February 2011 \u2013 June 2013 ) or La Matta ( the madwoman , from September 2013 onwards ) may contain one of the possibilities that may affect the progress of the game , positively or negatively , including doubling the top prize to \u20ac1,000,000 , or forcing the player to leave the game ( see below ) .",
      "The manager is known as Il Dottore ( the doctor ) and knows the content of the boxes . Therefore , sometimes his offers can give hints as to whether the contestants box contains a high amount of money .",
      "In order to give himself further chances , the manager sometimes decides to play Di pacco in pacco ( step by step ) when high prizes are still active .",
      "In Affari tuoi , to refuse an offer , instead of saying No Deal! , a contestant says , Rifiuto lofferta e vado avanti , meaning I refuse the offer and go on . To accept , a contestant says Accetto lofferta , meaning , Ill take the offer . Unlike the US version of the show , there is no button to push . ( In fact , international versions of Deal do not use a button and cover. )",
      "Comparison with other versions .",
      "- The Spanish version of Deal or no Deal , \u00a1All\u00e1 t\u00fa! , aired by Mediasets Telecinco is exactly the same format as the Italian version , except that the boxes represent 20 of the 50 provinces of Spain .",
      "- The British version uses boxes like the Italian one . The syndicated US version uses 22 like the British version , but uses briefcases like the primetime NBC version , and is somewhat different in format .",
      "- The French version , \u00c0 prendre ou \u00e0 laisser , is different in format , but uses a box for each region concept .",
      "Top prize winners .",
      "The first winner of \u20ac1 million occurred on April 7 , 2006 , when Maria Giulia Tullo from Fossalto won \u20ac1,000,000 .

      "On March 17 , 2012 , another million euro winning occurred to Gabriele Calvello , thanks to picking Raddoppia which doubles the top prize after opening Pacco Matto . Calvello , whose father died of cancer , decided to donate part of his winnings for cancer research .",
