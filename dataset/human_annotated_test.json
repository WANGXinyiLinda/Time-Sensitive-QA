      "Sabine Hossenfelder ( born 18 September 1976 ) is a German author and theoretical physicist who researches quantum gravity . She is a Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies where she leads the Superfluid Dark Matter group . She is the author of Lost in Math : How Beauty Leads Physics Astray , which explores the concept of elegance in fundamental physics and cosmology .",
      "Education .",
      "Hossenfelder completed her undergraduate degree in 1997 at Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t in Frankfurt am Main . She remained there for a Masters degree , and she wrote a thesis under the supervision of Walter Greiner titled Particle Production in Time Dependent Gravitational Fields , which she completed in 2000 . Hossenfelder received her doctorate from the same institution in 2003 , for the thesis Black Holes in Large Extra Dimensions under the supervision of Horst St\u00f6cker .",
      "Research .",
      "Hossenfelder remained in Germany until 2004 as a postdoctoral researcher at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt , Germany . She moved to North America and completed research fellowships at the University of Arizona , Tucson , University of California , Santa Barbara and Perimeter Institute , Canada . She joined Nordita Institute for Theoretical Physics , Sweden , in 2009 as an Assistant Professor . In 2018 she was a Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies .",
      "Hossenfelders research interest is in the phenomenology of quantum gravity . She focuses on the role of Lorentz invariance and locality , which would be altered in the discovery of quantum gravity . Hossenfelder is trying to find experimental evidence of quantum gravity . Since 2007 she has been involved with the annual conference series Experimental Search for Quantum Gravity . Hossenfelder has created a number of YouTube videos exploring the topic . She has been employed by the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies since 2015 , where she leads the Analog Systems for Gravity Duals group . Another area of her research are foundations of quantum mechanics , where she has argued against free will and in favor of superdeterminism .",
      "Hossenfelder has also been researching since at least 2008 on how technology is changing researchers ability to publicize , discuss , or publish their research , when she co-organized the Science in the 21st Century workshop .",
      "Public engagement and scientific achievements .",
      "Hossenfelder is a freelance popular science writer who has kept a blog since 2006 . She contributes to the Forbes column Starts with a Bang as well as Quanta Magazine , New Scientist , Nature Physics , Scientific American , Nautilus Quarterly and Physics Today . To show some gaps in the argument of Verlindes claim that gravity is an entropic force , she derived Verlindes formula for Newtons law of universal gravitation using a new form of an entropic variation formula that reduces to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the black hole event horizon . In 2016 , Hossenfelder offered to act as a physics consultant on her blog\u2014US$50 for twenty minutes of discussion\u2014and had to recruit five extra physicists to deal with the demand . In 2017 she created cards featuring pioneering quantum physicists . Live Science and The Guardian quoted Hossenfelder as an authority when trying to evaluate the importance of Stephen Hawkings last scientific publication .",
      "Basic Books are the publishers of Hossenfelders first book , Lost in Math : How Beauty Leads Physics Astray , released in June 2018 . A review in Nature described it as provocative , and Frank Wilczek recommended it as an intensely personal and intellectually hard-edged book , even though he disagreed with it on many points . Peter Woit summarized the books theme as follows :",
      "Hossenfelder also is invited for talks , about What is wrong with physics for example .",
      "Her 2018 book , Lost in Math , was also published in German with the title , Das h\u00e4ssliche Universum ( The Ugly Universe ) . Hossenfelder posits that the universe ( and its particle model ) is messy , and that it cannot be described by a mathematical ( beautiful ) Great Unified Theory .",

      "GMMTV ( , ) , formerly called Grammy Television , is a television production and talent agent subsidiary to the Thai entertainment conglomerate GMM Grammy which produces television shows , songs , and music videos . It was founded on August 3 , 1995 . Currently , Sataporn Panichraksapong is the Managing Director of the company .",
      "History .",
      "GMMTV Company Limited ( ) , formerly known as Grammy Television Company Limited ( ) , was founded on August 3 , 1995 by the GMM Grammy executives who saw the potential in developing , growing and strengthening the Thai television industry . The marketing department of the company was created into a separate entity to manage the television production industry . GMMTV started to produce TV game shows and music shows for analogue TV stations in Thailand at that time , namely , Channel 3 , Channel 5 , Channel 7 , and iTV , with Duangjai Lorlertwit and Saithip Montrikul na Ayudhaya as the managing directors , respectively .",
      "In 2007 , Saithip Montrikul na Ayudhaya left the company to manage GMM Media Public Co. , Ltd . As a result , Sataporn Panichraksapong , who was then the deputy managing director , became the new managing director and renamed the company into GMMTV Company Limited .",
      "On February 2 , 2009 , the company started running a cable and satellite television channel named Bang Channel by moving some of the TV shows which were aired on Channel 5 to its own channel , and began to produce different television programs in other genres aside from game shows and music shows . On June 29 , 2011 , GMMTV had set up a joint venture with Rungtham Pumseenil to establish Memiti Co. , Ltd . to expand and innovate the Thai television industry with 70% of shares held by GMMTV , and 30% held by Rungtham . Consequently , Memiti became a subsidiary of GMMTV .",
      "Due to the business restructuring of GMM Grammy , on June 24 , 2015 , GMM Grammys board of directors has passed the resolution to dispose the total 70% shares held by GMMTV in Memiti to The One Enterprise or One 31 channel business group as a new shareholder affecting Memiti to become a subsidiary of The One Enterprise accordingly . On December 5 the same year , GMMTVs board of directors resolved to close its cable and satellite television channel and instead focus on television production for One31 and GMM 25 which are digital channels . As a result , Bang Channel stopped broadcasting from December 31 , 2015 onwards .",
      "On August 24 , 2017 , after Adelfos Co. , Ltd , a subsidary of TCC Group ( Thailand ) has subscribed for the newly issued ordinary shares in GMM Channel Trading Co. , Ltd. , GMM Grammy has restructured its business to be in line with the share subscription agreement by passing a resolution to transfer all of its shares held in GMMTV to GMMCH ( GMM Channel Holding Co. , Ltd. , formerly GMM Channel Trading Co. , Ltd. ) or the business group of GMM 25 as the new shareholder .",
      "However , on November 27 , 2020 , the board of directors\u2019 meeting of GMM Grammy , in company with Siridamrongdham Co. , Ltd . of TCC Group , had the resolution to dispose and transfer all of their shares in GMMCH to ONE ( The One Enterprise Company Limited or One31 business group ) in accordance with the conditions and plans in relation to an initial public offering and list ONE in the Stock Exchange of Thailand . As a result , the company has been a subsidiary of The One Enterprise group with Takonkiet Viravan as the indirect director since December 1 .",
      "At present , GMMTV is a producer of entertainment programs , dramas , and television series for One31 and GMM 25 under the supervision and management of The One Enterprise which has the right to organize both channels . Because of the successful production of GMMTVs teen series and BL series on GMM 25 , One31 group has granted the prime-time slot of 8:30 pm - 9:30 pm on GMM 25 to GMMTV to broadcast their series every week .",

      "Eliot Lance Engel ( ; born February 18 , 1947 ) is an American politician who served as a U.S . representative from New York from 1989 to 2021 . A member of the Democratic Party , he represented a district covering portions of the north Bronx and southern Westchester County .",
      "In 2019 , following Democratic gains in the 2018 elections , he took over as Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee ; he previously was its ranking member from 2013 , following Howard Bermans reelection defeat in 2012 .",
      "In 2020 , after 16 terms in office , Engel was defeated in the Democratic primary by middle school principal Jamaal Bowman .",
      "Early life , education , and teaching career .",
      "Engel was born in the Bronx , the son of Sylvia ( n\u00e9e Bleend ) and Philip Engel , an ironworker . His grandparents , of Ukrainian Jewish background , were immigrants from the Russian Empire . He grew up in a city housing project , Eastchester Gardens , and attended New York City public schools .",
      "In 1969 , Engel graduated from Hunter-Lehman College of the City University of New York with a Bachelor of Arts in history . He subsequently received a masters degree in guidance and counseling in 1973 from the same institution , by now renamed Lehman College following the severance of its relationship with Hunter College . In 1987 , he earned a Juris Doctor from New York Law School .",
      "He began his political career in local Democratic clubs .",
      "He taught in the New York City School District and was a school counselor . He taught at Intermediate School 52 from 1969 to 1976 and then at Intermediate School 174 .",
      "New York State Assembly .",
      "In 1977 , Engel entered the special election for a seat in the New York State Assembly after the incumbent Democrat Alan Hochberg was forced to resign . He was the Liberal Party nominee in the special election , and on March 1 , 1977 , he won by 103 votes , defeating Democratic nominee Ted Weinstein and Republican nominee Arlene Siegel .",
      "Engel was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1977 to 1988 , sitting in the 182nd , 183rd , 184th , 185th , 186th and 187th New York State Legislatures . He chaired the Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse , as well as the Subcommittee on the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program .",
      "U.S . House of Representatives .",
      "Elections .",
      "In 1988 , Engel ran for the U.S . House of Representatives in New Yorks 19th congressional district His state assembly district covered much of the congressional districts southeastern corner . He defeated ten-term incumbent Democrat Mario Biaggi in the primary with 48% of the vote . Biaggi had been charged with racketeering in the Wedtech scandal , and was eventually jailed by Rudy Giuliani . Biaggi was unopposed for the Republican nomination ( he had run on both the Republican and Democratic lines since 1972 ) , which Engel won with 56% of the vote .",
      "Engels district , which became the 17th in 1993 and has been the 16th since 2013 , had historically been one of the more conservative districts in New York City . Republicans represented much of its territory at the state level as late as 2004 . However , reflecting the increasing Democratic trend in the Bronx at the federal level , Engel would never face another general election contest nearly as close as his first one . He was re-elected 14 more times by at least 61 percent of the vote and only dropped below 70 percent of the vote twice . As a measure of the districts growing Democratic trend , Biaggi is the last candidate running on the Republican line to clear the 40 percent mark .",
      "By the 1990s , as in much of the rest of New York City , the Democratic primary had become the real contest in this district . From 1990 to 2018 , Engel only faced two competitive primary contests ( getting less than 70% ) . In 1994 , he defeated musician Willie Col\u00f3n 62%-38% . In 2000 , Engel defeated State Senator Larry Seabrook , who had the support of Bronx County Democratic Party Chairman Roberto Ramirez , 50%-41% .",
      "In 2020 , Engel was challenged in the primary by Yonkers school principal Jamaal Bowman , who ran well to Engels left . Bowman received a surprise endorsement from State Senator Alessandra Biaggi , Mario Biaggis granddaughter . In a mid-June poll , he trailed Bowman by ten percentage points and , after the election , with early and election day votes counted , Bowman led Engel by almost 12,000 votes , 61.8% to 34.9% . Absentee ballots were scheduled to be counted on June 30 , 2020 , though some sources called the race for Bowman before the counting of absentee ballots . After the absentee ballots were counted , Bowmans lead was 55.4%-40.6% , or 13,218 votes . The race was called for Bowman on July 17 , 2020 , with the New York State Board of Elections certifying the results on August 6 , 2020 .",

It was designed to promote Americas national security and economic stability by reducing dependence on foreign oil through the use of clean alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies . It also called for increased tire efficiency - to increase a vehicles gas miles .",
      "Many provisions of the DRIVE Act were included in the Energy Independence and Security Act , which was signed into law on December 19 , 2007 , and became Public Law No . 110-140 . This law mandates increased fuel efficiency standards from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 . The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances , lighting and buildings , and the development of American-grown biofuels like cellulosic ethanol , biodiesel , and biobutanol .",
      "Engel introduced the Open Fuel Standards Act , alongside Congressmen Kingston , Steve Israel ( D-NY ) and Bob Inglis ( R-SC ) . This bill would have required 50 percent of new cars sold in the United States by 2012 ( and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015 ) to be flexible-fuel vehicles capable of running on any combination of ethanol , methanol , or gasoline . Flex fuel vehicles cost about $100 more than the same vehicle in a gasoline-only version .",
      "Engel on the Energy and Commerce Committee and Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment . He played a key role in negotiating the American Clean Energy and Security Act , HR 2454 , which passed the House on June 26 , 2009 . That legislation was intended to revitalize the economy by creating millions of new jobs , increase American national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil , and preserve the planet by reducing greenhouse gas emissions . It passed the House in 2009 , but was not voted on by the Senate in the 111th Congress .",
      "Gun control .",
      "A supporter of gun control , Engel has in Congress worked to ban assault weapons , high-capacity magazines and armor-piercing bullets , institute universal background checks , adopt extreme risk protection orders , and restore funding for gun violence research . Engel has received an F grade from the National Rifle Association and 100 percent ratings from the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence . He voted against a 2003 bill that immunized firearm manufacturers and dealers from civil liability for gun misuse , supports smart gun technology to prevent guns from being used by unauthorized persons , and voted against a bill to reduce the waiting period to purchase a gun at a gun show . In 2009 , Engel was one of 53 members of Congress who signed a letter to President Barack Obama , urging the new president to resume enforcement of a ban on the import of foreign assault weapons ( authorized by the Gun Control Act of 1968 and enforced during the administrations of George H . W . Bush and Bill Clinton ) . In 2011 , after 400,000 defective gun locks were recalled from the market , Engel introduced a bill intended to protect parents and children from faulty gun locks by instructing the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) to set a national quality standard for all child safety devices used on firearms .",

      "On December 22 , 2010 , President Barack Obama signed into law the Truth in Caller ID Act . The legislation was introduced by Bill Nelson in the Senate , passed the House on December 15 , and is virtually identical to Engels bill . The new law cracks down on the use of caller ID spoofing , often used by criminals to trick their victims into giving out personal information . The legislation will help law enforcement combat identity theft .",
      "Engel originally introduced the Securing our Borders and Our Data Act in July 2008 , HR 6702 . That bill would ensure that when a traveler enters the United States , a border agent cannot search or seize the travelers data or equipment without cause . The legislation was re-introduced in the 111th Congress as HR 239 . The Department of Homeland Security altered their rules to prevent agents from searching and seizing without cause . This encompassed much of Engels legislation .",
      "In the 109th Congress , Engel introduced the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act , HR 3402 . The bill was intended to stop some of the massive fraud in the prepaid calling card industry . The legislation passed the House unanimously , but the Senate did not act on it . In 2011 , Engel introduced the Drug Testing Integrity Act , which would prohibit products to be sold that enable cheating on drug tests .",
      "In 2010 , Engel urged the Federal Housing Finance Agency to stop their plan to ban private transfer fees on cooperative apartment sales . Some developers and investors had been abusing the system by imposing transfer fees that would have provided them with percentages on all future sales of the property over many decades . The transfer fee , when used correctly , can help owners and developers fund projects and remain affordable . The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011 .",
      "In 2012 , Engel introduced SNOPA , the Social Network Online Protection Act . It would guarantee online privacy and ensure that employers and educational institutions cannot use personal data as a bargaining chip for employment or education . Employers/schools would be barred from requesting or requiring usernames or passwords to social media sites as part of the hiring , employment , or enrollment process . The bill was re-introduced in the 113th Congress , with Rep . Michael Grimm as the Republican lead , and Rep . Jan Schakowsky as an original co-sponsor .",
      "International affairs .",
      "Engel is a supporter of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , and has also been an advocate for the causes of Albanian-Americans and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo . In 2003 , he authored the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act , which was signed into law by President George W . Bush on December 12 , 2003 . In this Law , Congress authorized penalties and restrictions on US relations with Syria for its occupation of Lebanon , and for its relationship with terrorist groups . Syria withdrew all forces from Lebanon in 2005 after the Cedar Revolution .",
      "In September 2020 , Engel stated that the influence of external actors such as Turkey recklessly meddling in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is troubling .",
      "Western Hemisphere Subcommittee .",
      "As Chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere , Engel has called for stronger U.S . relations with Latin America and the Caribbean . His Subcommittee has held hearings on issues such as the crisis in Haiti , poverty , and inequality in Latin America .",
      "Engel pushed for increased funding for emergency relief in Haiti , and for Temporary Protective Status ( TPS ) of Haitian nationals in the U.S . Engel is also supportive of the M\u00e9rida Initiative , in which the U.S . is cooperating with Mexico , Central America , the Dominican Republic , and Haiti to counter narco-trafficking and related violence in the region . In the 110th United States Congress , he introduced the Social Investment and Economic Development Act for the Americas of 2007 ( re-introduced in 2009 , where it also died in committee ) and sponsored the Western Hemisphere Energy Compact Act to develop partnerships to strengthen diplomatic relations with the Government of Brazil , and the governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere ( died in committee ) .",
      "The bi-partisan Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2009 ( sponsored by Rep . Engel ) was passed by the House on December 8 , 2009 ; it would have taken a fresh look at the United States counter-narcotics efforts , both at home and abroad . The bill did not pass the Senate .",
      "Middle East .",
      "Engel is one of the leading congressional supporters of Israel . Although he has supported resolutions critical of both Israelis and Palestinians , his criticisms of Israeli policies have usually been couched as warnings of their harm to Israel itself . In 2008 , he was the lead Democrat on a resolution condemning Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations . Shortly after entering Congress , he sponsored a resolution declaring Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel . A very pro-Israel position , this was contrary to official American policy until President Donald Trump adopted it in December 2019 . He also wrote the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act , which was signed into law by President George W . Bush on December 12 , 2003 . This law authorized restrictions on American relations with Syria , and penalties for its occupation of Lebanon , and for its relationship with terrorist groups .",

      "Kosovo and the Balkans .",
      "The Albanian American Civic League , an Albanian American lobby group in Washington , D.C. , added Engel to its lobby lineup of prominent politicians in the early 1990s . In 1996 , The Washington Post wrote , The Kosovo cause has been kept alive in Washington by a small group of congressmen led by Rep . Eliot L . Engel ( D-N.Y. ) While a member of the Subcommittee on Europe and Chair of the Congressional Albanian Issues Caucus , Engel fought ethnic cleansing in the 1999 Kosovo War and voiced support in Congress for the unilateral 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence from Serbia . A street has been named after him in Pej\u00eb , and he was the first foreign dignitary to address the Kosovo parliament .",
      "Cyprus .",
      "Engel called for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus , and authored a resolution in 1996 calling for its demilitarization . His 1994 law allowed the United States Department of State to conduct an investigation of five Americans who disappeared during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus , and found the remains of one . Engel received the George Paraskevaides Award on May 17 , 2007 , given to those who have utilized ancient Hellenic values to contribute to the nations and people of Cyprus and America and to the Hellenics in the modern world .",
      "Iraq War .",
      "In 2002 , although 133 members of the House of Representatives voted against it , Engel voted for the resolution granting President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq , as did the two Senators from New York , Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton , and almost 300 members of the United States House of Representatives . After revelations that intelligence provided to Congress was partially unreliable , and the subsequent problems faced after Saddam Hussein was deposed , Engel has come to regret his decision to support the 2003 invasion of Iraq , and consistently votes in favor of gradual withdrawal . He has met with anti-war activists , and in 2008 , he publicly called for the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp . Engel received an A grade from the Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans in 2008 .",
      "Irish affairs .",
      "In 2007 , Engel became a Co-Chair of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs . He supported the 1998 Good Friday Agreement , and aided Irish nationals facing deportation from the United States . He has been a friend of Gerry Adams , former leader of Sinn F\u00e9in , and was the author of legislation that prohibits employers in Northern Ireland and Ireland from receiving U.S . funds from the International Fund for Ireland , unless they comply with fair employment and non-discrimination principles called the MacBride Principles . In 2010 , Engel was instrumental in helping Joe Byrne return to the United States , after a bureaucratic problem left him detained in Ireland and separated from his family in Rockland County .",
      "Human rights .",
      "As a member of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus , Engel has supported Albanian-Americans and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo . He is co-author of the Harkin-Engel Protocol , along with Senator Tom Harkin ( D-IA ) , which addresses child labor in the cocoa fields of West Africa .",
      "In early 2001 , he wrote the House resolution condemning the Taliban for forcing Hindu citizens to wear distinguishing marks as reminiscent of the Nazis forcing Jews to wear a yellow Star of David . In 2008 , he wrote a resolution commending the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Promote Racial and Ethnic Equality .",
      "Engel sponsored a bill to support the Day of Silence , during which students vow to remain silent to bring attention to the harassment and discrimination faced by lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people in schools . That bill has been re-submitted in the 111th United States Congress . He also voted against the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , which allowed for states not to be required to recognize same-sex marriages in other states . In 2010 , he voted in 2010 to repeal the Dont Ask , Dont Tell policy , enabling homosexuals to serve openly in the U.S . military .",
      "In 2018 , Engel condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis .",
      "Engel urged the Trump administration to take a tougher line on China by imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who are responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in Chinas northwestern Xinjiang region . In March 2019 , the group of lawmakers led by Engel wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that read in part , This issue is bigger than just China . It is about demonstrating to strongmen globally that the world will hold them accountable for their actions .",
      "In June 2020 , Engel stated that Polish President Andrzej Duda and Polands nationalist Law and Justice ( PiS ) party promote horrifying homophobic and anti-LGBTQ stereotypes and policies that run counter to the human rights and values that America should strive to uphold .",
      "Iran nuclear deal .",
      "In August 2015 , Engel announced that he would oppose the Iran nuclear deal in congress , saying that , The answers Ive received simply dont convince me that this deal will keep a nuclear weapon out of Irans hands , and may in fact strengthen Irans position as a destabilizing and destructive influence across the Middle East .",
      "Controversies .",
      "In March 2009 , the Associated Press reported that Engel had been taking an annual tax credit on his Potomac , Maryland , residence for at least 10 years ( cumulatively receiving thousands of dollars in tax credits ) , despite the fact that the credit is reserved for people who declare Maryland their primary residence . Maryland officials revoked the tax credit . The matter was reviewed by the Office of Congressional Ethics , which also looked into similar tax credits claimed by three other members of the House . The OCE eventually ended its review on Engel and two of the other members of Congress ( Doris Matsui and Edolphus Towns ) without recommending further investigation by the House Ethics Committee .",
      "In 1988 , publisher Christopher Hagedorn began targeting Engel with criticism in his Bronx weekly newspapers ( the Bronx News , the Parkchester News , and the Co-op City News ) , when he alleged that Engel , when he was still an assemblyman , was behind a failed effort to evict the Co-op City News from its offices . In addition , Hagedorn later reprinted articles from other newspapers that contained criticism of Engel . Hagedorn also endorsed Engels Democratic opponents , including Larry Seabrook in 2000 ; however , this did not prevent Engels re-election to Congress .",
      "Engel mostly ignored Hagedorns criticism and accusations . In 1995 , however , his communications director , Greg Howard , told the Bronx Beat newspaper We dont consider Mr . Hagedorn a legitimate journalist . He uses the paper as his own personal platform for whatever agenda he has . He chooses the paper to malign people with whom he has philosophical differences . In the last decade , Hagedorns newspapers have been mostly silent in regard to Engel .",
      "In 2014 , Engel appeared at a pro-Israel rally in New York City with anti-Muslim activist Pamela Geller . He was criticised for sharing a stage with Geller .",
      "In January 2020 , he revealed that in a call after he was fired as Trumps National Security Adviser , John Bolton suggested to [ Engel ] \u2014 unprompted \u2014 that the [ Foreign Affairs Committee ] look into the recall of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch .",
      "In April 2020 , Engel claimed he had visited his district and taken part in COVID-19 and healthcare related events , before confirming when challenged that he had not returned to New York since March .",
      "In June 2020 , Engel appeared at a press conference to address the unrest resulting from the murder of George Floyd . When Bronx Borough President Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Jr . indicated there was not enough time for Engel to address the press , Engel responded , If I didnt have a primary , I wouldnt care . Diaz immediately rebuked Engel , saying , Were not politicizing . Everybodys got a primary , you know ?",
      "Grades and recognition .",
      "Engel received an A on the Drum Major Institutes 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues . Engel has received positive marks from major environmental groups such as the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club .",

      "Condor , legally incorporated as Condor Flugdienst GmbH , is a German charter airline based in Frankfurt . It operates scheduled flights to leisure destinations in Africa , the Caribbean , Europe , South Asia and North America . Its main base is at Frankfurt Airport with further smaller bases at other German airports .",
      "The airline was originally established as Deutsche Flugdienst GmbH on 21 December 1955 . Its initial fleet consisted of three 36-passenger Vickers VC.1 Viking aircraft , the airlines first tourist-orientated flight commenced on 29 March 1956 . In 1961 , Deutsche Flugdienst took over its rival Condor-Luftreederei and subsequently adopted Condor Flugdienst GmbH as its operating name . During 1966 , Condor launched its first long-haul flights . By this time , the airline had a majority market share of Germanys tourism air travel market . During the 1990s , Condor was restructured and merged with other businesses to become an integrated tourism concern known as C&N Touristik .",
      "From 2000 onwards , the Condor shares held by Lufthansa were gradually acquired by both Thomas Cook AG and Thomas Cook Group . On 4 February 2013 , the Thomas Cook Group announced that Thomas Cook Airlines , Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium , and Condor would be merged into a single operating segment of the Thomas Cook Group , Thomas Cook Group Airlines .",
      "On 23 September 2019 , Condors parent company Thomas Cook Group collapsed ; however , Condor received a bridge loan from the German government in order to remain in operation . Condor Flugdienst GmbH continues to be an asset of Thomas Cook Group plc until the asset is sold or the liquidation is completed by the Official Receiver .",
      "On 24 January 2020 , it was announced that the Polish Aviation Group , owner of LOT Polish Airlines , would acquire Condor . The acquisition was expected to be completed by April 2020 once antitrust approvals are obtained . However , on 2 April 2020 it was announced that the sale to LOT Polish Airlines had fallen through .",
      "History .",
      "1955\u20131979 : Establishment and early years .",
      "What would become Condor was founded on 21 December 1955 as Deutsche Flugdienst GmbH . Its initial ownership was divided between the German shipping company Norddeutscher Lloyd ( 27.75% ) , trans-Atlantic shipping firm Hamburg America Line ( 27.75% ) , German flag carrier airline Deutsche Lufthansa ( 26% ) , and railway company Deutsche Bundesbahn ( 18.5% ) . Deutsche Flugdiensts initial fleet consisted of three 36-passenger Vickers VC.1 Viking aircraft ; they were based at Frankfurt Airport , which was also a prominent Lufthansa hub at that time . On 29 March 1956 , the airlines first tourist-oriented flight commenced , this being a pilgrimage flight to the Holy Land . Within its first year of operation , destinations such as Majorca and the Canary Islands had been added to the airlines flight schedule .",
      "Between 1959 and 1960 , Lufthansa bought out the other shareholdings , acquiring sole ownership of Deutsche Flugdienst . In 1961 , Deutsche Flugdienst took over its rival Condor-Luftreederei ( which had been founded in 1957 by Oetker ) , subsequently changing its name to Condor Flugdienst GmbH , thus introducing the Condor name with Lufthansa . During the following year , Condor Flugdienst GmbH had a 63.3 % market share of Germanys tourism air travel market , transporting a total of 66,000 passengers in that year ; Majorca was by far the most popular destination , attracting 36,000 tourists .",
      "The following decade was an era of considerable growth for Condor . During 1966 , the company launched its first long-haul flights , reaching destinations such as Thailand , Sri Lanka , Kenya and the Dominican Republic . In 1971 , Condor became the first leisure-orientated airline in the world to adopt the Boeing 747 , which was the worlds\u2019 biggest aircraft during the era . By 1973 , Condors fleet consisted of a total of 14 Boeing airliners : Two Boeing 747s , two Boeing 707s and ten Boeing 727s .",
      "1980\u20131999 : Expansion and restructuring .",
      "During 1989 , the firm launched Condor Fl\u00fcge Individuell ( later known as Condor Individuell ) ; this venture leveraged its individual seat business to sell airline seats to members of the public directly . According to a Condor spokesman , the airline was selling around 15% of its tickets itself . During the early 1990s , production company S\u00fcdflug , a wholly owned subsidiary of Condor , was integrated into the airline . This change brought both the Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 jetliners into Condors service ; being configured with two-class cabins , Condor became the first tourism airline to introduce a separate , more comfortable class upon its aircraft .",
      "During 1995 , Condor expanded its shareholdings in other ventures . Condor-Touristik-Verbund held a 30% stake in alpha Holding GmbH , 37.5% of the shares in Kreutzer Touristik GmbH , wholly owned Fischer Reisen GmbH , and a 10% stake in \u00d6ger Tours GmbH . The airline also assumed ownership of the 40% stake held by parent airline Lufthansa in SunExpress , a Turkish charter airline ; its ownership of the firm would subsequently be extended to 50% .",
      "1996 was Condor Flugdienst GmbHs 40th anniversary ; to mark the occasion , American artist James Rizzi redecorated a Boeing 757 as a flying work of art , which was sometimes referred to as the Rizzi-Bird . In the latter half of that year , the company became the launch customer for the Boeing 757-300 , having placed twelve firm orders for the variant . To increase operational flexibility , Condor frequently trained its pilots so that they could operate both the Boeing 757 and 767 without any restrictions .",
      "During 1998 , the airline established Condor Berlin GmbH , a wholly owned subsidiary headquartered at Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport . This new entity was a low-cost carrier intended to compete with rivals such as Aero Lloyd and Air Berlin ; Condor estimated that its subsidiarys costs ought to be about 20% lower than the parent companys own . That same year , Condor placed orders for six Airbus A320-200 airliners , the most technologically modern short-haul aircraft in the world at that time ; that airline would subsequently operate twelve aircraft of the type in its fleet .",
      "The late 1990s was dominated by industrial consolidation efforts . Condors parent airline , Lufthansa , opted to break ties with Hapag-Lloyd to link up with Karstadt Group and NUR , its tour operator ; this led to the creation of the jointly owned C&N Touristik , bringing together Germanys largest holiday airline with tour operations . Thus , Condor became an integrated tourism concern .",
      "2000\u20132009 : Transition to Thomas Cook ownership .",
      "From 2000 onwards , the Condor shares held by Lufthansa were gradually acquired by both Thomas Cook AG and Thomas Cook Group .

On 23 January 2004 , Condor became part of Thomas Cook AG and returned to the Condor brand name . By December 2006 , the remaining Lufthansa shares only amounted to 24.9 percent .",
      "On 20 September 2007 , shortly after having taken over LTU International , Air Berlin announced its intention to acquire Condor in a share swap deal . It was intended to buy the 75.1 percent of Condor shares held by Thomas Cook , with the remaining Lufthansa assets being acquired in 2010 . In return , Thomas Cook would take up 29.99 percent of the Air Berlin stock . However , on 11 September 2008 , this plan was abandoned .",

On 27 June 2014 , Condor completed the cabin refurbishment for all of its long-haul Boeing 767 aircraft .",
      "In early 2017 , Condors CEO Ralf Teckentrup introduced a plan to cut operating costs by \u20ac40 million , because of the \u20ac14 million operating cost loss and the \u20ac1.4 billion revenue drop . The passenger numbers also dropped by 6% . Condor had also planned new routes to the United States for San Diego , New Orleans , and Pittsburgh ; all flights are operated by the 767-300ER .",
      "On 25 September 2019 , Condor secured additional credit facilities of \u20ac380 million to keep flying , despite the collapse of Thomas Cook Group .

      "World Athletics",
      "World Athletics ( name since October 2019 , formerly known as the International Amateur Athletic Federation and International Association of Athletics Federations , both abbreviated as the IAAF ) is the international governing body for the sport of athletics , covering track and field , cross country running , road running , racewalking , mountain running , and ultra running . Included in its charge are the standardization of rules and regulations for the sports , recognition and management of world records , and the organisation and sanctioning of athletics competitions , including the World Athletics Championships . The organisations president is Sebastian Coe of the United Kingdom , who was elected in 2015 and re-elected unopposed in 2019 for a further four years .",
      "History .",
      "The process to found World Athletics began in Stockholm , Sweden , on 17 July 1912 soon after the completion of the 1912 Summer Olympics in that city . At that meeting , 27 representatives from 17 national federations agreed to meet at a congress in Berlin , Germany , the following year , overseen by Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m who was to become the fledgling organisations first president . The 1913 congress formally completed the founding of what was then known as the International Amateur Athletic Federation ( IAAF ) .",
      "It was headquartered in Stockholm from 1912 to 1946 , in London from 1946 to 1993 , and thereafter moved to its current location in Monaco .",
      "In 1926 , the IAAF created a commission to regulate all ball games which were played by hand , including basketball and handball . Subsequently , the International Amateur Handball Federation was founded in 1928 , and the International Basketball Federation was founded in 1932 .",
      "Beginning in 1982 , the IAAF passed several amendments to its rules to allow athletes to receive compensation for participating in international competitions . However , the organization retained the word amateur in its name until its 2001 congress , at which it changed its name to the International Association of Athletics Federations . In June 2019 the organization chose to rebrand as World Athletics , with a rollout beginning after the 2019 World Championships in Doha .",
      "Following repeated requests , World Athletics became the last body within the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations to make public its financial reports in 2020 . It revealed the organisation had revenue of around US$200 million spread over a four-year Olympic cycle , with around a fifth of that revenue coming from Olympic broadcasting rights . The reports showed a deficit in each of the non-Olympic years of 2017 and 2018 of around US$20 million . It also showed heavy dependence on its partnership with Japanese marketing agency Dentsu , which made up half of 2018s revenue . It also highlighted reserves of US$45 million at the end of 2018 , which would allow the organisation to remain solvent in the face of delays to the 2020 Summer Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic . World Athletics Day is celebrated on 7 May .",
      "Governance .",
      "World Athletics is headed by a president . The World Athletics Council has a total of 26 elected members , comprising one president , four vice-presidents ( one senior ) , the presidents of the six area associations , two members of the Athletes Commission and 13 Council members . Each member of the Council is elected for a four-year period by the World Athletics Congress , a biennial gathering of athletics officials that consists of the Council , Honorary Members , and up to three delegates from each of the national member federations . Chairpersons and member of Committees , which manage specialist portfolios , are also elected by the Congress . There are four committees : the Cross Country Committee , the Race Walking Committee , the Technical Committee , and the Womens Committee . A further three committees were launched in 2019 : Development , Governance and Competitions . The governance structure is outlined in the World Athletics Constitution , which may be amended by the Congress .",
      "The World Athletics Council appoints a chief executive officer ( CEO ) , who is focused on improving the coverage of the sport and the organisations commercial interests . This role was created and merged with the General Secretary role that had existed previously . British former athlete and businessman Jon Ridgeon was appointed to the role in December 2018 . Olivier Gers was the first person to officially hold the position in 2016 , succeeding the interim CEO/General Secretary Jean Gracia .",
      "In order to give active athletes a voice in the governance of the sport , World Athletics created the Athletes Commission . Athletes are elected to the commission by other athletes , typically held at the Congress attached to the World Athletics Championships . The commission chairperson and one other athlete of the opposite sex are given voting rights on the Council . The last election was held in October 2019 at the 2019 World Athletics Championships .",
      "Following doping and corruption issues , a Code of Ethics was agreed in 2013 and an Ethics Commission was appointed in 2014 . The Council appoints the chairperson from the elected members , and in turn the chairperson appoints a deputy chair . The Ethics Boards scope was limited in 2017 with the creation of the independent Athletics Integrity Unit , headed by Australias Brett Clothier , to oversee ethical issues and complaints at arms length .",
      "The International Athletics Foundation is a charity closely associated with World Athletics that engages in projects and programmes to develop the sport . Albert II , Prince of Monaco is the Honorary President and the role of IAF President is held by the World Athletics President . A World Athletics Heritage department was created in 2018 to maintain historic artefacts and display them through a physical gallery in Monaco , a virtual online gallery , and a travelling exhibition . The department also issues World Athletics Heritage Plaques to commemorate locations of historic interest to the sport .",

      "Age .",
      "To allow athletes of different ages to compete against athletes of similar ability , several age categories are maintained . The open class of competition without age limit is defined as senior . For younger athletes , World Athletics organises events for under-20 athletes ( athletes aged 18 or 19 years on 31 December of the year of the competition ) as well as under-18 athletes ( athletes aged 16 or 17 years on 31 December of the year of the competition ) , historically referred to as junior and youth age groups , respectively . Age-group competitions over the age of 35 are organised by World Masters Athletics and are divided into five-year groupings .",
      "Doping .",
      "The organisation is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Agencys World Anti-Doping Code and applies sanctions to athletes , coaches and other sportspeople who breach the code through doping or impeding any anti-doping actions .",
      "Sex .",
      "International level athletics competitions are mostly divided by sex and World Athletics applies eligibility rules for the womens category . World Athletics has regulations for intersex and transgender athletes . The differences of sex development ( DSD ) regulations apply to athletes who are legally female or intersex and have certain physiology . Currently , such DSD limitations only apply to athletes competing in track running events from 400 metres to the mile run , though World Athletics publicly remains open to extending this to other events based on new scientific study . A DSD athlete who is legally female or intersex will be subjected to specific rules if she has XY male chromosomes , testes rather than ovaries , have circulating testosterone within the typical male range ( 7.7 to 29.4 nmol/L ) , and are androgen-sensitive so that their body makes use of that testosterone . World Athletics requires that any such athlete must reduce their blood testosterone level to 5 nmol/L or lower for a six-month period before becoming eligible for international competition . World Athletics created these rules as a way to ensure fair competition in the womens category . In October 2019 , World Athletics changed the testosterone limit for transgender competitors , setting it at 5 nmol/L , from the previous 10 nmol/L , in order to bring it in line with the DSD regulations . According to regulations from October 2019 , in order for a trans woman to compete in the womens category : 3.2.1 she must provide a written and signed declaration , in a form satisfactory to the Medical Manager , that her gender identity is female ; 3.2.2 she must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Expert Panel ( on the balance of probabilities ) , in accordance with clause 4 , that the concentration of testosterone in her serum has been less than 5 nmol/L3 continuously for a period of at least 12 months ; and 3.2.3 she must keep her serum testosterone concentration below 5 nmol/L for so long as she wishes to maintain her eligibility to compete in the female category of competition .",
      "The rules have been challenged by affected athletes in the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) , though no athlete has done so successfully . In May 2019 , CAS upheld the rules on the basis that discrimination against the minority of DSD athletes was proportional as a method of preserving access to the female category to a much larger majority of women without DSDs .",
      "Competitions .",
      "World Athletics organizes many major athletics competitions worldwide .",
      "One-day events .",
      "World Athletics became involved in annual one-day meetings as the sport began to professionalise in the late 1970s . Between 1978 and 1982 , World Athletics staged twelve Golden Events , all for men and principally in track running , which saw World Athletics offer prizes to encourage competition . Three years later in 1985 , an annual track and field circuit was created in the form of the IAAF Grand Prix , which linked existing top-level one-day meetings with a season-ending IAAF Grand Prix Final for a selection of mens and womens events . The IAAF World Cross Challenge followed in 1990 and began an annual series for cross country running . The track and field circuit was expanded in 1993 with the creation of the IAAF Grand Prix II level , and the IAAF Golden League in 1998 . World Athletics began recognising annual indoor track meets via the IAAF Indoor Permit Meetings series in 1997 , and in 1998 decathletes and heptathletes found seasonal support with the creation of the IAAF Combined Events Challenge . The World Cross Challenge was disbanded in 2000 and cross country reverted to a permit format via the IAAF Cross Country Permit Meetings . The IAAF Race Walking Challenge was initiated in 2003 to provide a seasonal calendar for racewalking .",
      "World Athletics reformed its track and field circuit in 2003 , with the IAAF World Outdoor Meetings series grouping five tiers of annual track and field competitions : the Golden League , IAAF Super Grand Prix , Grand Prix , Grand Prix II , and the IAAF World Athletics Final . The new final format was introduced with a new global performance ranking system for qualification and featured an increased programme of track and field events , mirroring the World Championships in Athletics programme bar the road events , combined events , relays , and the 10,000 metres . The final achieved gender parity in events in 2005 , with the inclusion of a womens 3000 metres steeplechase . The track and field circuit was rebranded as the IAAF World Athletics Tour in 2006 , which removed the global rankings and the IAAF Grand Prix II ( replaced with a level of meetings given permit status by continental governing bodies ) . With World Athletics having recognised the sport of mountain running in 2002 , the annual WMRA World Cup meetings received official sanctioning in 2006 . The IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final was created in 2007 to serve as a seasonal final for the Race Walking Challenge . World Athletics designed a sanctioning process for the road running competitions in 2008 , with races having to meet organisational requirements to achieve Gold or Silver status under the IAAF Road Race Label Events brand . This incorporated the World Marathon Majors ( a privately run series for major marathons initiated in 2006 ) within the Gold Label category . Road running was the last sport governed by World Athletics to receive seasonal sanctioning .",
      "The 2010 season saw several changes to World Athletics one-day governance . The World Athletics Tour was made defunct and replaced with three separate series : the 14-meet Diamond League as the top level of track meetings , the IAAF World Challenge as a second tier of track meetings , and the IAAF Hammer Throw Challenge as the top level of hammer throwing contests ( as hammer was not included in the Diamond League ) . The Road Race Label grouping was also expanded that year with the creation of a Bronze label status . The Race Walking Challenge Final was removed from the racewalking schedule after 2012 , as the series focused on international championship performances . In 2016 , the IAAF World Indoor Tour was introduced as a replacement of the Indoor Permit Meetings series .",
      "The track and field circuit is due for further changes in 2020 , including an increase in the number of Diamond League meetings , the reduction of Diamond League events from 32 to 24 , reduction of the Diamond League television running time to 90 minutes , the creation of a one-day Diamond League final , and the relaunch of the World Challenge series as the World Athletics Continental Tour .",
      "Awards .",
      "The organisation hosts the annual World Athletics Awards , formerly the World Athletics Gala until 2017 , at the end of each year to recognise the achievements of athletes and other people involved in the sport . Members may also be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame as part of the ceremony . The following awards are given :",
      "- Male Athlete of the Year",
      "- Female Athlete of the Year",

      "Doping controversy .",
      "In 2015 , a whistleblower leaked World Athletics blood test records from major competitions . The records revealed that , between 2001 and 2012 , athletes with suspicious drug test results won a third of the medals in endurance events at the Olympics and World Championships\u2014a total of 146 medals including 55 golds\u2014but the World Athletics caught none of them . After reviewing the results , Robin Parisotto , a scientist and leading anti-doping expert , said , Never have I seen such an alarmingly abnormal set of blood values . So many athletes appear to have doped with impunity , and it is damning that the IAAF appears to have idly sat by and let this happen . Craig Reedie , president of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) , said his organisation was very disturbed by these new allegations .. . which will , once again , shake the foundation of clean athletes worldwide , and that its independent commission will investigate the claims .",
      "Around the same time , the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany claimed that World Athletics suppressed publication of a 2011 report in which [ h ] undreds of athletes , as many as a third of the worlds top athletes , admitted violating anti-doping rules .",
      "On 1 November 2015 , former World Athletics president Lamine Diack was arrested in France and is under investigation on suspicion of corruption and money laundering . Diack allegedly accepted $1.2 million from the Russian athletics federation to cover up the positive doping tests of at least six Russian athletes in 2011 .",
      "In November 2015 , WADA published its report , which found systemic failures in the World Athletics had prevented an effective anti-doping programme and concluded that Russia should be banned from competing in international competitions because of its athletes test results . The report continued that the World Athletics allowed the conduct to occur and must accept its responsibility and that corruption was embedded in the organization .",
      "In January 2016 , as a result of the doping scandal and WADAs report , the World Athletics biggest sponsor , Adidas , announced that it was ending its sponsorship deal with the World Athletics four years early . The BBC reported that as a result World Athletics would lose $33 million ( \u00a323 million ) worth of revenue . The 11-year sponsorship deal with Adidas was due to run until 2019 . World-record holding sprinter Michael Johnson described the scandal as more serious than that faced by FIFA .",
      "In February 2016 , Nestl\u00e9 announced that it was ending its World Athletics sponsorship .",
      "In June 2016 , following a meeting of the IAAFs ruling council , World Athletics upheld its ban on Russias track and field team from entering the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .",
      "In February 2017 , All-Russia Athletic Federation was disqualified by decision of the World Athletics Council for 8 years for the creation of a doping system .",
      "World Athletics has since resisted demands that Russia be re-instated , on the basis that the country repeatedly failed to satisfy all the agreed criteria . The decision was supported by Sean Ingle of The Guardian who wrote in a column that World Athletics should maintain their ban on Russia through the 2016 Olympics in Rio . That meant Russian athletes could compete at all major events in the following years , including the 2017 IAAF World Championships in London and the 2018 European Championships in Berlin . In September 2018 , World Athletics faced a legal challenge by Russia to overturn the suspension after the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency , but Hugo Lowell of the i newspaper reported the countrys status would not change . The legal case was later dropped ."

York were in midtable for most of the first half of the season , and his signings in the winter transfer window had little impact on the team . Having been 14th in the table on 1 January 2013 , York went on a run of 11 matches without a win , and this left the team four points above the relegation zone in 18th place .

Mills was unable to keep York City in the National League and they were Relegated to the National League North on 29 April 2017 after a 2\u20132 draw with Forest Green Rovers . However , on 21 May 2017 , Mills York beat Macclesfield Town 3\u20132 at Wembley Stadium in the 2017 FA Trophy Final . Mills was dismissed by York on 30 September 2017 , on the same day as a defeat to South Shields in the FA Cup third qualifying round . A club statement read that the current league position is unacceptable , with York seventh in the National League North and 11 points away from the only automatic promotion place .",

      "In August 2020 Mills was appointed manager of Southern League Division One Central club Corby Town .",
      "Style of management .",
      "Mills management style was influenced by a number of managers he played under , including John Barnwell , Brian Clough , Alan Hinton , Howard Kendall , Brian Little , David Pleat , Russell Slade and Neil Warnock . He learned simplicity from Clough , saying : He never did complicate anything . Football is a simple game and Cloughie was no coach , he didnt confuse us with sessions straight out of the manual . Like Clough , Mills has been praised for his man management skills and Daren Fulford , his reserve-team manager at Tamworth , said : If he felt you had made a mistake , he would give you a rollicking but if he was pleased with you he would always give kind words . Fulford also commented on Mills thoroughness , saying he wanted information on each players performances after the reserves played .",
      "Mills sets his teams out to play a passing game , and affirmed this when stating : My philosophy is to play football with the ball on the deck , to play attacking football , to be disciplined with and without the ball . He prefers to employ a 4\u20133\u20133 formation , explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes them hard to beat , and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York . He has stuck with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn , saying : Im not going to change the way my teams play , the systems . Ive not even had a thought about that .",

      "Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park is located about southeast of Lethbridge , Alberta , Canada , or east of the community of Milk River , and straddles the Milk River itself . It is one of the largest areas of protected prairie in the Alberta park system , and serves as both a nature preserve and protection for many First Nations ( indigenous ) rock carvings and paintings . The park is sacred to the Blackfoot and many other aboriginal tribes .",
      "On 6 July 2019 , Writing-on-Stone / \u00c1\u00eds\u00ednai\u2019pi was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Its UNESCO application was filed under the name \u00c1\u00eds\u00ednai\u02bcpi , a Blackfoot language word meaning it is pictured / written . The provincial park is synonymous with the \u00c1\u00eds\u00ednai\u02bcpi National Historic Site of Canada .",
      "Resources .",
      "Writing-on-Stone Park contains the greatest concentration of rock art on the North American Great Plains . There are over 50 petroglyph sites and thousands of works . The park also showcases a North-West Mounted Police ( NWMP ) outpost reconstructed on its original site . The original outpost was burned down by persons unknown after it was closed in 1918 .",
      "The park features a visitor centre , campgrounds , picnic areas , group-use areas , and hiking trails , as well as canoeing and kayaking on the Milk River .",
      "Flora and fauna .",
      "The park comprises of coulee and prairie habitat , and is home to a diverse variety of plants and animals .",
      "Bird species include prairie falcons , great horned owls , short-eared owls , American kestrels , and cliff swallows , as well as introduced ring-necked pheasants and grey partridges .",
      "The prairie surrounding the park is good habitat for pronghorn antelopes . Other animals found in the park area include mule deer , northern pocket gophers , skunks , raccoons , yellow-bellied marmots , and bobcats . Tiger salamanders , boreal chorus frogs , leopard frogs , and plains spadefoot toads represent the amphibians . Reptiles include garter snakes , bull snakes , and prairie rattlesnakes .",
      "The coulee environment is optimal for balsam poplars and narrow leaf cottonwoods . There are also peachleaf willows and plains cottonwoods in the park . Shrubs include chokecherry , juniper , saskatoon , sandbar willow , and two varieties of wild rose . Some of the northernmost species of cactus , including Opuntia ( prickly pear ) and Pediocactus ( pincushion ) , are found in the park as well .",
      "Geologic setting .",
      "The sandstone outcrops in the park belong to the Milk River Formation , which was deposited along the edge of a large inland sea about 84 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous epoch . Meltwater from the retreating glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age carved the present Milk River valley , and water , ice and wind eroded the sandstone to produce the hoodoos and cliffs that are part of the park today .",
      "History .",
      "There is evidence that the Milk River Valley was inhabited by First Nations people as long ago as 9000 years . First Nations tribes such as the Blackfoot probably created many of the rock carvings ( petroglyphs ) and paintings ( pictographs ) . Other First Nations groups such as the Shoshone also travelled through the valley and may have also created some of the art . These carvings and paintings tell of the lives and journeys of those who created them , and of the spirits they found here . The towering cliffs and hoodoos had a powerful impact on the native visitors , who believed these were the homes of powerful spirits . The shelter of the coulees and the abundance of game and berries made the area that is now the park an excellent location for these nomadic people to stop on their seasonal migrations . While the greatest use of the area was made by those in transit , there is some evidence , including tipi rings and a medicine wheel , that there was some permanent settlement here .",
      "Beginning about 1730 , large numbers of horses , metal goods , and guns began to appear on the western plains . This signified not only a change in the First Nations lifestyle , but a change in the content of the rock art . Pictures of hunters on horseback , and warriors without body shields began to be created .",
      "In 1887 a North-West Mounted Police ( the precursor to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ) camp was set up at Writing-on-Stone to attempt to curtail cross-border whisky smuggling , which was devastating the native population , and to put a stop to First Nations horse-raiding parties . But in fact neither problem ever became serious at this outpost , and the NWMP spent most of their time fighting summer grass fires , herding stray American cattle back across the border , and riding hundreds of uneventful kilometres on border patrol . In the period immediately preceding World War I , settlers began to arrive in the area , which helped to alleviate some of the boredom and isolation the NWMP officers faced . In 1918 , the outpost was closed , as Canadian authorities felt little possibility of criminal activity along the border , and shortly thereafter , the outpost fell victim to arson by persons unknown .",
      "The park was created in 1957 and was designated an archaeological preserve in 1977 . As part of the NWMP centennial celebrations , the outpost was reconstructed between 1973 and 1975 , and is now one of the attractions in the park . Archaeologists from the Alberta Provincial Parks Department surveyed and catalogued numerous petroglyph and pictograph sites within the park in 1973 . In 1981 , a portion of the park was named a Provincial Historic Resource to protect this rock art from increasing impact from vandalism and graffiti . The most sensitive areas are now set aside in areas designated for guided tours only . In 1977 , the park preserved the archaeology of the pictographs and petroglyphs . This protection makes the park one of the largest concentrations of rock art in the North American Plains . In 2004 Parks Canada added the park to Canadas tentative list of possible world heritage sites . The application indicated that the Blackfoot people would also like the Sweet Grass Hills of Montana included as part of the world heritage site . In March 2005 , the park was designated a National Historic Site . On June 20 , 2007 , the parks new visitor centre , with views of the valley from the north rim , was officially opened ."

      "Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian",
      "Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian ( ; 16 December 1922 \u2013 20 April 2019 ) was an Iranian artist and a collector of traditional folk art . She is noted for having been one of the most prominent Iranian artists of the contemporary period , and she was the first artist to achieve an artistic practice that weds the geometric patterns and cut-glass mosaic techniques ( \u0100ina-k\u0101ri ) of her Iranian heritage with the rhythms of modern Western geometric abstraction . In 2017 , the Monir Museum in Tehran , Iran was opened in her honor .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Shahroudy was born on December 18 , 1922 , to educated parents in the religious town of Qazvin in north-western Iran . Farmanfarmaian acquired artistic skills early on in childhood , receiving drawing lessons from a tutor and studying postcard depictions of western art . After studying at the University of Tehran at the Faculty of Fine Art in 1944 , she then moved to New York City via steamboat , when World War II derailed her plans to study art in Paris . In New York , she studied at Cornell University , at Parsons The New School for Design , where she majored in fashion illustration , and at the Art Students League of New York .",
      "Career .",
      "As a fashion illustrator , she held various freelance jobs , working with magazines such as Glamour before being hired by the Bonwit Teller department store , where she made the acquaintance of a young Andy Warhol . Additionally , she learned more about art through her trips to museums and through her exposure to the 8th Street Club and New Yorks avant-garde art scene , becoming friends with artists and contemporaries Louise Nevelson , Jackson Pollock , Willem de Kooning , Barnett Newman , and Joan Mitchell .",
      "First return to Iran .",
      "In early 1957 , Farmanfarmaian moved back to Iran . Inspired by the resident culture , she discovered a fascination with tribal and folk artistic tradition of her countrys history , which led her to rethink the past and conceive a new path for her art . In the following years , she would further develop her Persian inspiration by crafting mirror mosaics and abstract monotypes . Meanwhile her work was featured at the Iran Pavilion in the 1958 Venice Biennale , and holding a number of exhibitions in places such as Tehran University ( 1963 ) , the Iran-America Society ( 1973 ) , and the Jacques Kaplan/Mario Ravagnan Gallery ( 1974 ) .",
      "Exile and return to Iran .",
      "In 1979 , Farmanfarmaian and her second husband , Abol-Bashar , traveled to New York to visit family . Around the same time , the Islamic Revolution began , and so the Farmanfarmaians found themselves exiled from Iran , an exile that would last for over twenty years . Farmanfarmaian attempted to reconcile her mirror mosaics with the limited resources offered in America , but such lacking materials and comparatively inexperienced workers restricted her work . In the meantime , she placed larger emphasis on other aspects of her art , such as commissions , textile designs , and drawing .",
      "Third return to Iran and death .",
      "In 1992 , Farmanfarmaian returned to Iran and later , in Tehran in 2004 , she reaffirmed her place among Irans art community , gathering both former and new employees to help create her mosaics . She continued to live and work in Tehran until her death .",
      "On 20 April 2019 Farmanfarmaian died at her home at the age of 96 .",
      "Artwork .",
      "Aside from her mirror work ( a technique known as \u0100ina-k\u0101ri ) , Farmanfarmaian is additionally known for her paintings , drawings , textile designs , and monotypes .",
      "Mirror mosaics .",
      "Around the 1970s , Farmanfarmaian visited the Shah Cheragh mosque in Shiraz , Iran . With the shrines high-domed hall .. . covered in tiny square , triangular , and hexagonal mirrors , similar to many other ancient Iranian mosques , this event acted as a turning point in Farmanfarmaians artistic journey , leading to her interest in mirror mosaic artwork . In her memoir , Farmanfarmaian described the experience as transformative : The very space seemed on fire , the lamps blazing in hundreds of thousands of reflection .. . It was a universe unto itself , architecture transformed into performance , all movement and fluid light , all solids fractured and dissolved in brilliance in space , in prayer . I was overwhelmed.Aided by the Iranian craftsman , Hajji Ostad Mohammad Navid , she created a number of mosaics and exhibition pieces by cutting mirrors and glass paintings into a multitude of shapes , which she would later reform into constructions which evoked aspects of Sufism and Islamic culture . \u0100ina-k\u0101ri is the traditional art of cutting mirrors into small pieces and slivers , placing them in decorative shapes over plaster . This form of Iranian reverse glass and mirror mosaics is a craft traditionally passed on from father to son . Farmanfarmaian , however , was the first contemporary artist to reinvent the traditional medium in a contemporary way . By striving to mix Iranian influences and the tradition of mirror artwork with artistic practices outside of strictly Iranian culture , offering a new way of looking at ancient aesthetic elements of this land using tools that are not limited to a particular geography , Farmanfarmaian was able to express a cyclical conception of spirituality , space , and balance in her mosaics .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Farmanfarmaian married Iranian artist Manoucher Yektai in 1950 . They divorced in 1953 , and in 1957 , she returned to Tehran to marry lawyer Abolbashar Farmanfarmaian . In 1991 , Abolbashar died of leukemia . She has two daughters , Nima and Zahra . While living in Iran , Farmanfarmaian was also an avid collector . She sought out paintings behind glass , traditional tribal jewelry and potteries , and amassed one of the greatest collections of coffee-house paintings in the country\u2014commissioned paintings by folk artists as coffee-house , story-telling murals . The vast majority of her works and her collections of folk art were confiscated , sold or destroyed .",
      "Exhibitions .",
      "Farmanfarmaians work has been publicly exhibited in museums , including : Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) , Solomon R . Guggenheim Museum , Grand Rapids Art Museum , Leighton House Museum , Haus der Kunst , Irish Museum of Modern Art ( IMMA ) , Zentrum Paul Klee , Savannah College of Art and Design Museum and more . Her work has been shown in private galleries including The Third Line , Dubai ; New York ; Grey Art Gallery , New York University ; Galerie Denise Rene , Paris and New York ; Lower Belvedere , Vienna ; and Ota Fine Art , Tokyo .",
      "Farmanfarmaian participated in the 29th Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo ( 2010 ) ; the 6th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art ( 2009 ) ; and the Venice Biennale ( 1958 , 1966 and 2009 ) . In 1958 she received the Venice Biennale , Iranian Pavilion ( gold medal ) ( solo ) .",
      "Suzanne Cotter curated Farmanfarmaians work for her first large museum retrospective titled Infinite Possibility : Mirror Works and Drawings which was on display at the Serralves Museum ( also known as Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Serralves ) in Porto , Portugal ( 2014-2015 ) and then the exhibition travelled to the Solomon R . Guggenheim Museum in New York City ( 2015 ) . This was her first large US museum exhibition .",
      "Commissioned installations .",
      "Major commissioned installations include work for the Queensland Art Gallery ( 2009 ) , the Victoria and Albert Museum ( 2006 ) , the Dag Hammerskjod building , New York ( 1981 ) and the Niyavaran Cultural Center ( 1977\u201378 ) , as well as acquisitions by the Metropolitan Museum of Art , The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art , and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo .",

With a collection of 51 works donated by the artist , the Monir Museum collection is managed by the University of Tehran .",
      "In popular culture .",

      "Germaine of Foix",
      "Germaine of Foix ( ; ; 1488 \u2013 15 October 1536 ) was the queen consort of King Ferdinand II of Aragon from their marriage in 1506 until his death in 1516 . His first wife , Isabella I of Castile , died in 1504 .",
      "Germaines father was John of Foix , Viscount of Narbonne and son of Queen Eleanor of Navarre . Her mother , Marie of Orl\u00e9ans , was the sister of King Louis XII of France .",
      "Queenship .",
      "Following the death of his wife , Isabella I , in 1504 , Ferdinand had to yield the government of Castile to his son-in-law Philip of Burgundy ( 1478\u20131506 ) , who assumed power in the name of his wife Joanna ( 1479\u20131555 ) , Isabellas heiress . Ferdinand objected to Philips policies and to prevent Philip from gaining Aragon through Joanna , he sought to have a male heir with a new wife . A new male heir would displace Joanna ( and by extension her husband ) from the line of succession . He negotiated with King Louis XII of France for a marriage , hoping to gain accession to the throne of Navarre . At the Treaty of Blois , Louis agreed to have his niece Germaine of Foix marry Ferdinand ; Germaine was Louis niece ( daughter of his sister ) and Ferdinands grandniece ( granddaughter of his half-sister ) . Louis XII also ceded in the treaty his weak claim to the Kingdom of Naples ( already controlled by Aragon ) and Kingdom of Jerusalem ( controlled by neither ) to his niece , conditional on a male child being produced . The marriage , between Ferdinand ( aged 54 ) and Germaine ( aged 18 ) , took place in March 1506 . A short truce and brief alliance between the two kings resulted , despite several wars before and after the Treaty .",
      "In 1506 Philip of Burgundy died and Ferdinand became regent of Castile for his mentally unstable daughter Joanna . Ferdinand and Germaine did have a son , John , Prince of Girona on 3 May 1509 , but he died shortly after birth . Despite the use of love potions , they did not have another . If John had lived , then the Crown of Aragon would have split from the Crown of Castile once again ( after being semi-unified by Ferdinand and Isabellas marriage ) . This included Aragon , Valencia , Majorca , and Catalonia in Spain , and the Kingdom of Naples , Sicily and Sardinia in the Italian peninsula and the Tyrrhenian Sea . With Juans death , both Castile and Aragon would eventually go to Ferdinand and Isabellas daughter Joanna .",
      "Ferdinands diplomatic deviousness and off-and-on alliances with France infuriated Henry VIII of England ( born 1491 , reigned 1509\u20131547 ) , married to Ferdinand and Isabellas youngest daughter , Catherine of Aragon ( 1485\u20131536 ) . Seeing this match devalued , Henry in 1514 forced his sister Mary ( 1496\u20131533 ) into a loveless marriage with Louis XII to spite Ferdinand . Louis XII died the next year .",
      "Death of Ferdinand and Succession of Charles V .",
      "Ferdinand died after two years of health problems in 1516 , leaving Germaine a widow . Ferdinands successors were Joanna and her son Charles V . Ferdinand did , however , leave Germaine a yearly income of 50,000 gold florins , and exhorted his grandson Charles V in his last letter not to abandon her .",
      "In 1517 , Charles V moved from the Netherlands to Castile as the new King of Castile and Aragon . Germaine moved from Aragon to Castile to join his court as well , where the 17-year-old king took well to his 29-year-old stepgrandmother . He organized several tournaments and banquets in her honor . On 20 August 1518 , Germaine gave birth in Valencia to a daughter , Isabel . It is widely speculated among historians that Charles V was Isabels father ; Germaine refers to her in her will as the Infanta Isabel , a title that would usually only be given to the daughter of a King .",
      "Charles V , Germaine , and Charles Vs sister Eleanor moved from Castile to Aragon in 1519 , where he would be formally sworn in as King of Aragon . He would spend a year in Aragon , negotiating with its parliament and managing affairs . While in Barcelona , Charles V arranged for Germaine to marry the margrave Johann of Brandenburg-Ansbach , a landless cadet and cousin of Joachim I , Elector of Brandenburg . Germaine left Spain to travel with Charles V to Germany , where she was married .",
      "Vicereine of Valencia .",
      "In 1523 Charles V appointed the couple jointly viceroys of Valencia . There Germaine , recently returned to Spain , dealt with the fallout of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods by the Valencian guilds ( Germanies ) . Germaine favored harsh treatment of the agermanats ; she is thought to have signed the death warrants of 100 former rebels personally , and sources indicate that as many as 800 executions may have occurred in total . This undid the more lenient policy of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza , who had favored reconciliation with the rebels . In December 1524 , Germaine signed a pardon that officially ended the persecution of all former participants in the rebellion . However , fines imposed on the guilds and guild-aligned cities as punishment would take many years to be repaid .",
      "It is maintained by Valencian historians that the fact that Germaine moved her court to Valencia was the first step in the degradation of social prestige of the Valencian language in the Kingdom of Valencia , as the higher classes started favouring Castilian/Spanish over their native language to please her .",
      "Next year after Johanns death in 1525 , Germaine married Ferdinand , Duke of Calabria , a son of King Frederick IV of Naples ( 1496\u20131501 ) by his second wife Isabella del Balzo . The two continued as viceroys of Valencia and were patrons of the arts and music . Germaine also encouraged the slow integration of Valencia with Castilian-dominated Spain as a whole .",
      "Germaine died on 15 October 1536 in Liria , probably due to obesity related edema , and was interred in the Monastery of San Miguel de los Reyes . The Duke of Calabria continued in office until his death in 1550 ."

      "German submarine U-254 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germanys Kriegsmarine , built for service in the Second World War and the Battle of the Atlantic . She was a mildly successful boat which carried out three war patrols , but fell victim to a freak accident during an attack on an Allied convoy in the mid-Atlantic Ocean on her third patrol and was lost .",
      "Built in 1941 at Vegesack , U-254 was commanded for all her brief career by Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Hans Gilardone , except for a brief period of illness , when Kptlt . Odo Loewe took command for her second patrol . She conducted her warm-up and training period in the Baltic Sea in the first half of 1942 , before she was despatched to Kiel from where she participated in her first war operations .",
      "Design .",
      "German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines . U-254 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged . She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke , six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced , two AEG GU 460/8\u201327 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged . She had two shafts and two propellers . The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .",
      "The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged , the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced , she could travel at . U-254 was fitted with five torpedo tubes ( four fitted at the bow and one at the stern ) , fourteen torpedoes , one SK C/35 naval gun , 220 rounds , and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns . The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty .",
      "Service history .",
      "1st patrol .",
      "Her first war patrol was a simple one , entailing a passage between Kiel and her new home base in Brest in occupied France . During this month-long journey , U-254 was ordered to spend sometime cruising off Reykjav\u00edk , Iceland , hoping to catch some stragglers from northern convoys or supply ships running to the Allied forces stationed on the island . She had one success , sinking a small British freighter on 2 August before she headed for her new home .",
      "2nd patrol .",
      "Her second patrol was more eventful , when on 3 October , after twelve days of cruising , she spotted the 11,000 ton American tanker Esso Williamsburg in the central North Atlantic and sank her with one torpedo , killing 28 . This was followed six days later by another success in a similar area , when the British ship was sunk by three torpedoes with all 45 crew on board .",
      "The promising career of U-254 was almost cut short on this cruise , when the Norwegian damaged her with depth charges during an attack on a convoy in the same area as her previous victories .",
      "3rd patrol .",
      "After repairs , U-254 departed in late November 1942 , returning to her old operating grounds of the North Atlantic routes . In December , the weather in the region is atrocious and visibility practically nil , so as U-254 maneuvered to attack Convoy HX 217 , to which she had been directed on 8 December , it is perhaps unsurprising that her crew failed to see come steaming out of the gloom and straight into her broadside . The two submarines had become lost in the dark and collided with one another in a freak accident , which claimed 41 of U-254s crew , who were spilled into the ocean as the boat heeled over and sank . Sailors from U-221 dived into the turbulent sea tied to ropes , and succeeded in rescuing four bedraggled survivors of the sinking . U-221 was badly damaged . Unable to dive , Oberleutnant zur See Trojer aborted the patrol and returned to St . Nazaire , France ."

      "The Chicago Red Stars are a professional womens soccer club based in Bridgeview , Illinois , a suburb of Chicago . A founding member of the Womens Professional Soccer ( WPS ) league , they have played in the National Womens Soccer League ( NWSL ) since 2013 .",
      "WPS was the NWSLs predecessor as the professional womens soccer league in the United States , and the Red Stars played in the WPS in 2009 and 2010 . After leaving the WPS in December 2010 due to the leagues financial issues , the club joined the Womens Premier Soccer League ( WPSL ) for the 2011 season . In 2012 , the Red Stars co-founded and played in Womens Premier Soccer League Elite ( WPSL-E ) : a one-year league which bridged the WPS and the NWSL . The club became a founding member of the NWSL , which was financially supported by U.S . Soccer , in 2012 .",
      "The Red Stars play their home games at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview . In December 2020 , they held the record for the longest active playoff streak ( 2015\u20132019 ) in the NWSL .",

      "Establishment .",
      "In 2006 , it was announced that Chicago would field a team in a new womens professional soccer league . The team joined six others ( Washington Freedom , Boston Breakers , Los Angeles Sol , FC Gold Pride , Sky Blue FC , and Saint Louis Athletica ) in Womens Professional Soccer ( WPS ) for the leagues inaugural season in 2009 . Marcia McDermott , former head coach of the Northwestern University womens soccer team and the Womens United Soccer Associations Carolina Courage , was named as the Red Stars general manager .",
      "On June 3 , 2008 , the Red Stars name was announced at a Toyota Park ceremony . The name refers to the four six-pointed red stars on the flag of Chicago . Each star represents a landmark event in Chicago history : Fort Dearborn , the Great Chicago Fire , the 1893 Worlds Fair , and the 1933 Worlds Fair . Other names considered were Progress , Towers , Union , Blues , 1871 , and Wind . Red Stars was chosen by popular vote in a two-month fan poll .",
      "2009 season .",
      "The Red Stars won their first game of the season , 1\u20130 , at Saint Louis Athletica . They followed with two ties ( 1\u20131 at Washington Freedom and 0\u20130 hosting Sky Blue FC ) and a 4\u20130 shutout of the Boston Breakers at Toyota Park . This was the best starting record of any team in the league except season champions Los Angeles Sol , seeming to live up to preseason predictions .",
      "The team was then winless for its next nine games ( with three away draws ) , including a 451-minute scoring drought . The Washington Freedom , scored first in their next game , indicating that the streak would continue . However , the Red Stars came from behind to win 2\u20131 . They defeated last-place FC Gold Pride 3\u20131 in their next game before losing four of their last five games , eliminating them from the playoffs and ending the season in sixth place . The Red Stars finished second in league attendance in 2009 , behind the LA Sol .",
      "Agreeing to see the Red Stars through their first season , Peter Wilt stepped down as CEO at the end of 2009 to become general manager of the Milwaukee Wave ( his hometown NISL team ) . General manager Marcia McDermott assumed many of Wilts responsibilities , although he continued to support the team on the leagues board of governors and as president of the Chicago Red Stars Charitable Foundation .",
      "2010 season .",
      "The Red Stars began their second season with high hopes and new faces . They lost their first game at Sky Blue FC 1\u20130 , after dominating much of the game . A 1\u20131 home tie in their second game earned the Stars their first point of the season . After a successful season , the team left WPS on December 13 because they were unable to meet the leagues funding requirements for the 2011 season ; the league folded in 2011 for financial and legal reasons .",
      "2011 Womens Premier Soccer League season .",

      "The Red Stars finished the regular season with a 10\u20131 record , hosting the playoff semifinals and championship matches . Defeating Tampa Bay Hellenic 2\u20131 in their semifinal , they lost in overtime by the same score in the final to the Orange County Waves ( another WPSL team with WPS connections ; Brittany Klein , a 2009\u201310 Red Stars player , was on the Waves ) .",

      "The Red Stars finished fourth in the league , making the playoffs . They advanced to the final , where they lost to the Flash in a 2\u20134 penalty shootout after a 1\u20131 draw at the end of extra time . Red Stars Ella Masar and Lori Chalupny were injured on the same play in the 33rd minute . WNY scored the equalizer in regulation with a 40-yard goal in the 97th minute to reach overtime . The Red Stars won the 2012 National Womens Cup with half their roster , since the cup final was played at the same time as their final WPSL Elite regular-season match against the eventual third-place New York Fury .",

      "In November 2012 , the Red Stars co-founded and was one of the original eight teams in a yet-to-be-named womens professional soccer league in concert with United States Soccer Federation , the Canadian Soccer Association , and the Mexican Football Federation . The league began competition in spring 2013 .",
      "2013 season .",
      "All NWSL teams received an allocation of USWNT players , and the Red Stars received Shannon Boxx , Amy LePeilbet , and Keelin Winters ; only Boxx had limited playing time that season . The Red Stars began the season with two draws and four losses . The mid-season arrival of Germans Sonja Fuss and Inka Grings revived the team somewhat , but not enough to qualify for the playoffs . The Red Stars played 22 matches with eight wins , six draws , and eight losses to finish the season in sixth place .",
      "2014 season .",
      "In 2014 , the Red Stars finished in fifth place . The club was waiting for United States international player Christen Press to join after completing her commitment to a European club , and the Canadian international player Melissa Tancredi to gain full fitness after college . The team signed two other internationals , Abby Erceg and Emily van Egmond , in May . Despite the late arrival of international stars , at the end of May the team had six wins , one draw , and two losses ; its performance was aided by rookies Julie Johnston , Vanessa DiBernardo , Hayley Brock , young players Jen Hoy , Rachel Quon , veterans Lori Chalupny and Michelle Wenino , and goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc . With a mid-season slump ( one win in 11 matches during June and July ) , the team did not qualify for the playoffs and was edged out by head-to-head results with the Washington Spirit .",
      "2015 season .",
      "The Red Stars began the 2015 season with three home games : a 3\u20132 win over the previous seasons Supporting Shield winner Seattle Reign FC , a 2\u20132 draw with Portland Thorns FC , and a 1\u20130 win against Sky Blue FC .

The Red Stars defeated the Portland Thorns 1\u20130 in a semifinal home game , and lost 4\u20130 to the North Carolina Courage in the final . Their season record was 14 wins , two draws , and eight losses .",
      "Crest and colors .",
      "The clubs original primary logo combined two Chicago images ; the shape of the shield is taken from its equivalent in Chicagos city seal .

      "Eintracht Braunschweig",
      "Braunschweiger Turn- und Sportverein Eintracht von 1895 e.V. , commonly known as Eintracht Braunschweig ( ) or BTSV ( ) , is a German football and sports club based in Braunschweig , Lower Saxony . The club was one of the founding members of the Bundesliga in 1963 and won the national title in 1967 . The club plays in the 2 . Bundesliga , the second tier of the German football league system .",
      "Since 1923 , Eintracht Braunschweig has played at the Eintracht-Stadion . The club shares a rivalry with fellow Lower Saxon side Hannover 96 .",
      "In addition to the football division , Eintracht has departments for several other sports , of which historically the field hockey department has been the most successful .",
      "History .",
      "Foundation and early years .",
      "Eintracht Braunschweig was founded as the football and cricket club FuCC Eintracht 1895 in 1895 , became FC Eintracht von 1895 in 1906 , then SV Eintracht in 1920 .",
      "The team has a colorful history and it quickly became one of northern Germanys favorite sides . In 1900 , Eintracht Braunschweig was among the founding members of the German Football Association ( DFB ) . It enjoyed success early on , playing in the upper tier league , winning the Northern German championship in 1908 and 1913 , and placing three players on the Germany national team by 1914 . Under the Third Reich , the team played in the Gauliga Niedersachsen and managed two appearances in the national final rounds . In 1942\u201343 , Eintracht Braunschweig went into the national championship play-offs as one of the main favourites . The team under manager Georg Schorsch Kn\u00f6pfle had just won the newly formed Gauliga S\u00fcdhannover-Braunschweig with a record of 17 wins and 1 draw in 18 games , scoring 146 goals in the process . After a convincing 5\u20131 win over Victoria Hamburg in the first round , the draw saw the club paired with the other big favorites for the title , Helmut Sch\u00f6ns Dresdner SC . Dresden won the game held in Dresden with 4\u20130 and subsequently went on to win the German championship with an undefeated season .",
      "Post-war football .",
      "As part of the denazification of Germany after World War II , the British authorities dissolved all previously existing sports clubs in Braunschweig and demanded the creation of a single , united sports club for the city . As such , Eintracht Braunschweig was merged into the new club TSV Braunschweig on 2 November 1945 . TSV Braunschweig finally took on the clubs current name , Braunschweiger TSV Eintracht von 1895 , on 1 April 1949 .",
      "The club continued to play in the top division \u2013 now the Oberliga Nord \u2013 after the war , with the exception of a single season ( 1952\u201353 ) spent in tier II . The side was touched by tragedy in 1949 when goalkeeper Gustav F\u00e4hland died of internal bleeding a few days after being injured during a game in a collision with a Werder Bremen striker . Another appearance in the final round of the national championship came in 1958 .",
      "Bundesliga football 1963 to 1985 .",
      "Eintracht Braunschweigs consistently high standard of play and financial stability helped it to become one of the 16 teams selected out of a group of 46 applicants for play in the Bundesliga , the new federal professional league formed in 1963 . Once again the side enjoyed early success , capturing the national title in the 1966\u201367 season under manager Helmuth Johannsen with solid defensive play . That championship team gave up only 27 goals against , which stood as a Bundesliga record until bettered by Werder Bremen in 1988 . Another ten players joined the national side from the team , mostly through the 1960s and 70s .",
      "The club was hit by tragedy again during the winter break of the 1968\u201369 season when forward J\u00fcrgen Moll , aged 29 at the time , and his wife died in a car accident . Two charity matches were played for the benefit of the Molls children , the first featured West Germanys 1954 FIFA World Cup-winning squad in the line-up of the tournaments final , and the second saw a combined squad of Eintracht Braunschweig and rivals Hannover 96 take on a Bundesliga all-star team .",
      "The club found itself embroiled in the Bundesliga scandal of 1971 , but with a somewhat unusual twist . A number of players accepted payments totaling 40,000 DM \u2013 not to underperform and so lose or tie a game , but rather to put out an extra effort to win . Ultimately , two players were suspended and another ten were fined .",
      "In 1973 , in the face of some opposition from the league , Braunschweig became the first Bundesliga side to sport a sponsor logo on its jerseys \u2013 that of Wolfenb\u00fcttel-based liquor producer J\u00e4germeister . The move paid the team 100,000 DM and introduced a new way of doing business to football that is worth millions today . Other clubs quickly followed suit . Braunschweigs game against Schalke 04 on 24 March 1973 became the first-ever Bundesliga match to feature a club having sponsorship on its jersey . J\u00e4germeister continued to sponsor the club until 1987 , although a later attempt to rename the team J\u00e4germeister Braunschweig was finally refused by the DFB in 1983 .",
      "Eintracht Braunschweig just missed a second title in 1977 when it finished third , one point back of champion Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and just behind second-place finisher Schalke 04 on goal difference . The club made news after the season by signing 1974 World Cup winner Paul Breitner from Real Madrid for a transfer fee of 1.6 million DM . Breitner , however , did not fit into the team at all and was sold to Bayern Munich after just one season .",
      "The side counted a casualty in the Cold War in the death of Lutz Eigendorf , who fled East Germany in 1979 , where he played for Dynamo Berlin , to come to the west to play for 1 . FC Kaiserslautern . Shortly after his transfer to Braunschweig in 1983 , he died in a motor vehicle accident which was revealed in 2000 as the assassination of a traitor arranged by the Stasi , East Germanys secret police .",
      "The club played in the Bundesliga through to the mid-1980s having been relegated just twice , playing in the second division in 1973\u201374 and again in 1980\u201381 . During the clubs run of 322 games in the Bundesliga from 1963 to 1973 , it set a record that still stands by not seeing a single player red-carded . In 1984\u201385 , Eintracht Braunschweig was relegated from the Bundesliga for the third time .",
      "Decline .",
      "Since the 1985\u201386 season , the side has played at the tier II and III levels . In 1987 , Braunschweig managed to set a mark even as they were demoted ; it became the only team ever to have been relegated with a positive goal differential , with 52 goals for and 47 against . After having been stuck in the Regionalliga for most of the 1990s , Eintracht Braunschweig moved constantly between the 2 . Bundesliga and the Regionalliga during the 2000s . At the end of the 2007\u201308 Regionalliga season , the club was facing a severe crisis , both financially and on the field : Eintracht was in serious danger of missing out on qualification for Germanys new nationwide third-tier league 3 . Liga , which would have meant Braunschweigs first ever relegation to the fourth level of the German football league system .",
      "Recent history .",
      "With new manager Torsten Lieberknecht , however , who had only taken over the job a few weeks before , Eintracht Braunschweig managed to qualify for the 3 . Liga on the last matchday of the season . Moreover , under Lieberknecht and also newly appointed director of football Marc Arnold , the club continued to steadily improve throughout the next few seasons ; a resurgence on and off the field that was widely recognized by the German media . In 2010\u201311 , the team won promotion back into the 2 . Bundesliga as champions of the 3 . Liga . There , Eintracht Braunschweig re-established itself quickly , finishing the 2011\u201312 season comfortably mid-table . The 2012\u201313 season should prove even more successful : on the second matchday , Braunschweig took over a direct promotion spot and kept it for the rest of the season . On the 31st matchday , the club secured its return to the Bundesliga after 28 years in the second and third divisions with a 1\u20130 away win over FC Ingolstadt 04 .",
      "The team finished the 2013\u201314 Bundesliga season in 18th place and was therefore relegated again after one season in the top-flight . Eintracht Braunschweig had spent most of the season on a relegation spot , but had a chance to stay in the league until the last matchday . However , the club was officially relegated on 10 May 2014 after a 1\u20133 loss at 1899 Hoffenheim . Eintracht came close to a return to the Bundesliga in 2016\u201317 : the club finished third in the 2 . Bundesliga and qualified for the promotion play-off to the Bundesliga , but lost 0\u20132 on aggregate to VfL Wolfsburg to remain in the 2 . Bundesliga .",
      "On 13 May 2018 , Eintracht Braunschweig were relegated to the 3 . Liga after a 6\u20132 loss to Holstein Kiel .",
      "Crest and colours .",
      "Colours .",
      "Traditionally , Eintracht Braunschweig plays its home games in the colours blue and yellow . Those colours are derived from the flag of the Duchy of Brunswick .",
      "Crest .",
      "The clubs crest contains a red lion on white ground . This symbol is derived from the coat of arms of the city of Braunschweig , which in turn is based on the insignia of Henry the Lion . The club badge went through various different versions during its history , most of the time however it consisted of a circular badge in blue and yellow , with a red lion on a white shield in the center of the circle .",
      "In 1972\u201373 , Eintracht Braunschweig scrapped the original crest and replaced it with a new design based on the logo of its sponsor , J\u00e4germeister . This was initially done to circumvent the DFBs ban on shirt sponsors \u2013 a loophole in those rules allowed to club to put a very close looking symbol on their shirt as long as it was the clubs official crest . In 1986 , after J\u00e4germeister stopped the sponsorship of the club , Eintracht Braunschweig adopted a new , diamond shaped logo containing the traditional red lion as well as the clubs colours blue and yellow .",
      "In 2011 , the club members voted to return to the clubs more traditional round crest . In March 2012 , the club then presented the new version of the crest , which was adopted as the official logo at the start of the 2012\u201313 season . For the 2016\u201317 season , the club wore a special anniversary crest to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the clubs 1966\u201367 Bundesliga title .",
      "Stadium .",
      "Eintracht Braunschweig plays at the Eintracht-Stadion in Braunschweig , built in 1923 . Currently the stadium has a capacity of ca . 25,000 , during the 1960s it held up to 38,000 people . Before the construction of the Eintracht-Stadion , the club played its home games at Sportplatz an der Helmstedter Stra\u00dfe , which held 3,000 people .",
      "Supporters .",
      "Despite spending recent years in the lower divisions , the clubs fan support has remained strong : with 21,396 per game , Eintracht Braunschweig had the 24th-highest average attendance of any sports team in Germany during the 2011\u201312 season .",
      "While friendly fan relations exist with 1 . FC Magdeburg , Waldhof Mannheim , and Swiss club Basel , Eintracht Braunschweig has a strong rivalry with Hannover 96 .",
      "Because of Wolfsburgs immediate proximity to Braunschweig , journalists often report a rivalry with VfL Wolfsburg . Also matches between the both are often referred to as derby . This is denied by the fans of Eintracht Braunschweig as well as the Fans of Hannover 96 , who only consider their matches against each other as the only true Lower Saxony derby .",

      "Henry Hank Melson Stommel ( September 27 , 1920 \u2013 January 17 , 1992 ) was a major contributor to the field of physical oceanography . Beginning in the 1940s , he advanced theories about global ocean circulation patterns and the behavior of the Gulf Stream that form the basis of physical oceanography today . Widely recognized as one of the most influential and productive oceanographers of his time , Stommel was both a groundbreaking theoretician and an astute , seagoing observer .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Stommel was born in Wilmington , Delaware . An anomaly among modern scientists , Stommel became a full professor without an earned doctorate . He received his B.S . in astronomy from Yale University ( 1942 ) and served there as instructor in mathematics and astronomy ( 1942\u201344 ) .",
      "Academic posts .",
      "He was research associate at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution from 1944 to 1959 where the Office of Naval Research generously supported his projects . He became professor of oceanography at Harvard University in 1959 and moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963 , where he remained until 1978 , returning to Woods Hole until his retirement . Stommel established the PANULIRUS station ( begun in 1954 ) in Bermuda . PANULIRUS was the name of a wooden , round bilged research vessel ( thus R/V Panulirus ) operated by the Bermuda Biological Station for Research for many years . On a monthly schedule , the vessel obtained sea water samples at vertical intervals from the surface to great depths , which yielded temperature , salinity and some additional chemical data . Because the sea bottom falls away very sharply , particularly to the East-south-east of Bermuda , it is possible to obtain a representative sampling within a few miles of land . The resulting data set constitutes the longest such data series of similar character in the North Atlantic Ocean .",
      "Stommel was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1962 and received the National Medal of Science in 1989 .",
      "Discoveries .",
      "Henry Stommel showed that the north-south gradient of the strength of the horizontal Coriolis force ( the beta effect ) was responsible for the observed fact that the return flow of the slow interior gyre circulations is concentrated in fast moving western boundary currents , such as the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current , a process known as western intensification . As a result , these western boundary currents have a larger and steadier transport than the corresponding boundary currents , such as the California Current and Canary Current , on the eastern side of the ocean basins . In subtropical latitudes , the western boundary currents are important in transporting the excess heat the earth receives in the tropics towards the poles .",
      "Together with Arnold Arons , Stommel extended this circulation to the deep ocean , proposing a global circulation in which surface water sinks in the polar regions to feed the deep boundary currents on the western sides of basins , while the interior flow actually moves towards the pole . This work , based on laboratory studies , predated the discovery of such boundary currents , and remains one of the great triumphs of theoretical physical oceanography . Stommel also developed early models of the thermohaline circulation which suggested that it might have more than one stable state .",
      "In addition to his work on large-scale ocean currents , Stommel did research on a variety of problems in oceanography and meteorology . These include work on the classification of estuaries , estimates of turbulent diffusion , and studies of the impact of volcanoes on climate .",
      "Marriage .",
      "Stommel married Elizabeth Brown , daughter of Huntington Brown , professor of English at the University of Minnesota , and Elizabeth Waldo Wentworth Brown , originally of Boston , on December 6 , 1950 . They had three children : Matthew ( a professional fisherman in Falmouth , Massachusetts ) , Elijah ( a physician at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center ) , and Abigail Stommel Adams ( a nurse practicing in Falmouth ) .",

      "European Central Bank",
      "The European Central Bank ( ECB ) is the central bank of the Eurozone , a monetary union of 19 EU member states which employ the euro . Established by the Treaty of Amsterdam , the ECB is one of the worlds most important central banks and serves as one of seven institutions of the European Union , being enshrined in the Treaty on European Union ( TEU ) . The banks capital stock is owned by all 27 central banks of each EU member state . The current President of the ECB is Christine Lagarde . Headquartered in Frankfurt , Germany , the bank formerly occupied the Eurotower prior to the construction of its new seat .",
      "The primary objective of the ECB , mandated in Article 2 of the Statute of the ECB , is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone . Its basic tasks , set out in Article 3 of the Statute , are to set and implement the monetary policy for the Eurozone , to conduct foreign exchange operations , to take care of the foreign reserves of the European System of Central Banks and operation of the financial market infrastructure under the TARGET2 payments system and the technical platform ( currently being developed ) for settlement of securities in Europe ( TARGET2 Securities ) . The ECB has , under Article 16 of its Statute , the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes . Member states can issue euro coins , but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand .",
      "On 1 December 2009 , the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force , ECB according to the article 13 of TEU , gained official status of an EU institution .",
      "The ECB is governed by European law directly , but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital . Its capital is \u20ac11 billion held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders . The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states population and GDP , but the capital key has been adjusted . Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral .",
      "When the ECB was created , it covered a Eurozone of eleven members . Since then , Greece joined in January 2001 , Slovenia in January 2007 , Cyprus and Malta in January 2008 , Slovakia in January 2009 , Estonia in January 2011 , Latvia in January 2014 and Lithuania in January 2015 .",
      "History .",
      "Early years of the ECB ( 1998-2007 ) .",
      "The European Central Bank is the de facto successor of the European Monetary Institute ( EMI ) . The EMI was established at the start of the second stage of the EUs Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ECB and European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) . The EMI itself took over from the earlier European Monetary Co-operation Fund ( EMCF ) .",
      "The ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the Treaty on European Union ( TEU , Treaty of Maastricht ) , however it did not exercise its full powers until the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 , signalling the third stage of EMU . The bank was the final institution needed for EMU , as outlined by the EMU reports of Pierre Werner and President Jacques Delors . It was established on 1 June 1219 The first President of the Bank was Wim Duisenberg , the former president of the Dutch central bank and the European Monetary Institute . While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI ( taking over from Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium ) just before the ECB came into existence , the French government wanted Jean-Claude Trichet , former head of the French central bank , to be the ECBs first president . The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany , its president should be French . This was opposed by the German , Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro . Tensions were abated by a gentlemans agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate , to be replaced by Trichet .",
      "Trichet replaced Duisenberg as President in November 2003 . Until 2007 , the ECB had very successfully managed to maintain inflation close but below 2% .",
      "The ECBs response to the financial crises ( 2008-2014 ) .",
      "The European Central Bank underwent through a deep internal transformation as it faced the global financial crisis and the Eurozone debt crisis .",
      "Early response to the Eurozone debt crisis .",
      "The so-called European debt crisis began after Greeces new elected government uncovered the real level indebtedness and budget deficit and warned EU institutions of the imminent danger of a Greek sovereign default .",
      "Foreseeing a possible sovereign default in the eurozone , the general public , international and European institutions , and the financial community reassessed the economic situation and creditworthiness of some Eurozone member states , in particular Southern countries . Consequently , sovereign bonds yields of several Eurozone countries started to rise sharply . This provoked a self-fulfilling panic on financial markets : the more Greek bonds yields rose , the more likely a default became possible , the more bond yields increased in turn .",
      "Trichets reluctance to intervene .",
      "This panic was also aggravated because of the inability of the ECB to react and intervene on sovereign bonds markets for two reasons . First , because the ECBs legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds ( Article 123 . TFEU ) , This prevented the ECB from implementing quantitative easing like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008 , which played an important role in stabilizing markets .",
      "Secondly , a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating ( BBB- ) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECBs open market operations . This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold , many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations . According to former member of the governing council of the ECB Athanasios Orphanides , this change in the ECBs collateral framework planted the seed of the euro crisis .",
      "Faced with those regulatory constraints , the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets . Up until 6 May 2010 , Trichet formally denied at several press conferences the possibility of the ECB to embark into sovereign bonds purchases , even though Greece , Portugal , Spain and Italy faced waves of credit rating downgrades and increasing interest rate spreads .",
      "ECBs market interventions ( 2010-2011 ) .",
      "In a remarkable u-turn , the ECB announced on 10 May 2010 , the launch of a Securities Market Programme ( SMP ) which involved the discretionary purchase of sovereign bonds in secondary markets . Extraordinarily , the decision was taken by the Governing Council during a teleconference call only three days after the ECBs usual meeting of 6 May ( when Trichet still denied the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds ) . The ECB justified this decision by the necessity to address severe tensions in financial markets . The decision also coincided with the EU leaders decision of 10 May to establish the European Financial Stabilisation mechanism , which would serve as a crisis fighting fund to safeguard the euro area from future sovereign debt crisis .",
      "The ECBs bond buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt . They were intended to dampen international speculation against those countries , and thus avoid a contagion of the Greek crisis towards other Eurozone countries . The assumption is that speculative activity will decrease over time and the value of the assets increase .",
      "Although SMP did involve an injection of new money into financial markets , all ECB injections were sterilized through weekly liquidity absorption . So the operation was neutral for the overall money supply .",
      "In September 2011 , ECBs Board member J\u00fcrgen Stark , resigned in protest against the Securities Market Programme which involved the purchase of sovereign bonds from Southern member states , a move that he considered as equivalent to monetary financing , which is prohibited by the EU Treaty . The Financial Times Deutschland referred to this episode as the end of the ECB as we know it , referring to its hitherto perceived hawkish stance on inflation and its historical Deutsche Bundesbank influence .",
      "As of 18 June 2012 , the ECB in total had spent \u20ac212.1bn ( equal to 2.2% of the Eurozone GDP ) for bond purchases covering outright debt , as part of the Securities Markets Programme . Controversially , the ECB made substantial profits out of SMP , which were largely redistributed to Eurozone countries . In 2013 , the Eurogroup decided to refund those profits to Greece , however the payments were suspended over 2014 until 2017 over the conflict between Yanis Varoufakis and ministers of the Eurogroup . In 2018 , profits refunds were reinstalled by the Eurogroup . However , several NGOs complained that a substantial part of the ECB profits would never be refunded to Greece .",
      "Role in the Troika ( 2010-2015 ) .",
      "The ECB played a controversial role in the Troika by rejecting all forms of debt restructuring of public and private debts , forcing governments to adopt bailout programmes and structural reforms through secret letters to Italian , Spanish , Greek and Irish governments . It has further been accused of interfering in the Greek referendum of July 2015 by constraining liquidity to Greek commercial banks .",
      "In November 2010 , it became clear that Ireland would not be able to afford to bail out its failing banks , and Anglo Irish Bank in particular which needed around 30 billion euros , a sum the government obviously could not borrow from financial markets when its bond yields were soaring to comparable levels with the Greek bonds . Instead , the government issued a 31bn EUR promissory note ( an IOU ) to Anglo \u2013 which it had nationalized . In turn , the bank supplied the promissory note as collateral to the Central Bank of Ireland , so it could access emergency liquidity assistance ( ELA ) . This way , Anglo was able to repay its bondholders . The operation became very controversial , as it basically shifted Anglos private debts onto the governments balance sheet .",
      "It became clear later that the ECB played a key role in making sure the Irish government did not let Anglo default on its debts , in order to avoid a financial instability risks . On 15 October and 6 November 2010 , the ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sent two secret letters to the Irish finance Minister which essentially informed the Irish government of the possible suspension of ELAs credit lines , unless the government requested a financial assistance programme to the Eurogroup under condition of further reforms and fiscal consolidation .",
      "Over 2012 and 2013 , the ECB repeatedly insisted that the promissory note should be repaid in full , and refused the Governments proposal to swap the notes with a long-term ( and less costly ) bond until February 2013 . In addition , the ECB insisted that no debt restructuring ( or bail-in ) should be applied to the nationalized banks bondholders , a measure which could have saved Ireland 8 billion euros .",
      "In April 2011 , the ECB raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 from 1% to 1.25% , with a further increase to 1.50% in July 2011 . However , in 2012\u20132013 the ECB sharply lowered interest rates to encourage economic growth , reaching the historically low 0.25% in November 2013 . Soon after the rates were cut to 0.15% , then on 4 September 2014 the central bank reduced the rates by two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05% . Recently , the interest rates were further reduced reaching 0.00% , the lowest rates on record .",
      "In a report adopted on 13 March 2014 , the European Parliament criticized the potential conflict of interest between the current role of the ECB in the Troika as \u2018technical advisor\u2019 and its position as creditor of the four Member States , as well as its mandate under the Treaty . The report was led by Austrian right-wing MEP Othmar Karas and French Socialist MEP Liem Hoang Ngoc .",
      "The ECBs response under Mario Draghi ( 2012-2015 ) .",
      "On 1 November 2011 , Mario Draghi replaced Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the ECB . This change in leadership also marks the start of a new era under which the ECB will become more and more interventionist and eventually ended the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis .",
      "Draghis presidency started with the impressive launch of a new round of 1% interest loans with a term of three years ( 36 months ) \u2013 the Long-term Refinancing operations ( LTRO ) . Under this programme , 523 Banks tapped as much as \u20ac489.2 bn ( US$640 bn ) . Observers were surprised by the volume of the loans made when it was implemented . By far biggest amount of was tapped by banks in Greece , Ireland , Italy and Spain . Although those LTROs loans did not directly benefit EU governments , it effectively allowed banks to do a carry trade , by lending off the LTROs loans to governments with an interest margin . The operation also facilitated the rollover of of maturing bank debts in the first three months of 2012 .",
      "Whatever it takes ( 26 July 2012 ) .",
      "Facing renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone continued Mario Draghi made a decisive speech London , by declaring that the ECB ...is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the Euro . And believe me , it will be enough . In light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis , Draghis statement has been seen as a key turning point in the eurozone crisis , as it was immediately welcomed by European leaders , and led to a steady decline in bond yields for eurozone countries , in particular Spain , Italy and France .",
      "Following up on Draghis speech , on 6 September 2012 the ECB announced the Outright Monetary Transactions programme ( OMT ) . Unlike the previous SMP programme , OMT has no ex-ante time or size limit . However , the activation of the purchases remains conditioned to the adherence by the benefitting country to an adjustment programme to the ESM . The program was adopted with near unanimity , the Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann being the sole member of the ECBs Governing Council to vote against .",
      "Even if OMT was never actually implemented until today , it made the Whatever it takes pledge credible and significantly contributed in stabilizing financial markets and ended the sovereign debt crisis . According to various sources , the OMT programme and whatever it takes speeches were made possible because EU leaders previously agreed to build the banking union .",
      "Low inflation and quantitative easing ( 2015-2019 ) .",
      "In November 2014 , the bank moved into its new premises , while the Eurotower building was dedicated to host the newly established supervisory activities of the ECB under the Single Supervisory Mechanism .",
      "Although the sovereign debt crisis was almost solved by 2014 , the ECB started to face a repeated decline in the Eurozone inflation rate , indicating that the economy was going towards a deflation . Responding to this threat , the ECB announced on 4 September 2014 the launch of two bond buying purchases programmes : the Covered Bond Purchasing Programme ( CBPP3 ) and Asset-Backed Securities Programme ( ABSPP ) .",
      "On 22 January 2015 , the ECB announced an extension of those programmes within a full-fledge quantitative easing programme which also included sovereign bonds , to the tune of 60 billion euros per month up until at least September 2016 . The programme was started on 9 March 2015 .",
      "On 8 June 2016 , the ECB added corporate bonds to its asset purchases portfolio with the launch of the corporate sector purchase programme ( CSPP ) . Under this programme , it conducted net purchase of corporate bonds until January 2019 to reach about \u20ac177 billion . While the programme was halted for 11 months in January 2019 , the ECB restarted net purchases in November 2019 .",
      "As of 2021 , the size of the ECBs quantitative easing programme had reached 2947 billion euros .",
      "Christine Lagardes era ( 2019- ) .",
      "In July 2019 , EU leaders nominated Christine Lagarde to replace Mario Draghi as ECB President . Lagarde resigned from her position as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund in July 2019 and formally took over the ECBs Presidency on 1 November 2019 .",
      "Lagarde immediately signaled a change of style in the ECBs leadership . She embarked the ECBs into a strategic review of the ECBs monetary policy strategy , an exercise the ECB had not done for 17 years . As part of this exercise , Lagarde committed the ECB to look into how monetary policy could contribute to address climate change , and promised that no stone would be left unturned . The ECB president also adopted a change of communication style , in particular in her use of social media to promote gender equality , and by opening dialogue with civil society stakeholders .",
      "Response to the COVID-19 crisis .",
      "However , Lagardes ambitions were quickly slowed down with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis .",
      "In March 2020 , the ECB responded quickly and boldly by launching a package of measures including a new asset purchase programme : the \u20ac1350 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme ( PEPP ) which aimed to lower borrowing costs and increase lending in the euro area . The PEPP was extended to cover an additional \u20ac500 billion in December 2020 . The ECB also re-launched more TLTROs loans to banks at historically low levels and record-high take-up ( EUR 1.3 trillion in June 2020 ) . Lending by banks to SMEs was also facilitated by collateral easing measures , and other supervisory relaxations . The ECB also reactivated currency swap lines and enhanced existing swap lines with central banks across the globe",
      "Strategy Review .",
      "As a consequence of the Covid19 crisis , the ECB extended the duration of the strategy review until September 2021 .",
      "Mandate and inflation target .",
      "Unlike many other central banks , the ECB does not have a dual mandate where it has to pursue two equally important objectives such as price stability and full employment ( like the US Federal Reserve System ) . The ECB has only one primary objective \u2013 price stability \u2013 subject to which it may pursue secondary objectives .",
      "Primary mandate .",
      "The primary objective of the European Central Bank , set out in Article 127 ( 1 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone . However the EU Treaties do not specify exactly how the ECB should pursue this objective . The European Central Bank has ample discretion over the way it purses its price stability objective , as it can self-decide on the inflation target , and may also influence the way inflation is being measured .",
      "The Governing Council in October 1998 defined price stability as inflation of under 2% , \u201ca year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices ( HICP ) for the euro area of below 2%\u201d and added that price stability \u201dwas to be maintained over the medium term\u201d . In May 2003 , following a thorough review of the ECBs monetary policy strategy , the Governing Council clarified that \u201cin the pursuit of price stability , it aims to maintain inflation rates below , but close to , 2% over the medium term\u201d .",
      "Since 2016 , the European Central Banks President has further adjusted its communication , by introducing the notion of symmetry in its definition of its target , thus making it clear that the ECB should respond both to inflationary pressure to deflationary pressures . As Draghi once said symmetry meant not only that we would not accept persistently low inflation , but also that there was no cap on inflation at 2% .",
      "Secondary mandate .",
      "Without prejudice to the objective of price stability , the Treaty ( 127 TFEU ) also provides room for the ECB to pursue other objectives:Without prejudice to the objective of price stability , the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union.This legal provision is often considered to provide a secondary mandate to the ECB , and offers ample justifications for the ECB to also prioritize other considerations such as full employment or environmental protection , which are mentioned in the Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union . At the same time , economists and commentators are often divided on whether and how the ECB should pursue those secondary objectives , in particular the environmental impact . ECB official have also frequently pointed out the possible contradictions between those secondary objectives . To better guide the ECBs action on its secondary objectives , it has been suggested that closer consultation with the European Parliament would be warranted .",
      "Tasks .",
      "To carry out its main mission , the ECBs tasks include :",
      "- Defining and implementing monetary policy",
      "- Managing foreign exchange operations",
      "- Maintaining the payment system to promote smooth operation of the financial market infrastructure under the TARGET2 payments system and being currently developed technical platform for settlement of securities in Europe ( TARGET2 Securities ) .",
      "- Consultative role : by law , the ECBs opinion is required on any national or EU legislation that falls within the ECBs competence .",
      "- Collection and establishment of statistics",
      "- International cooperation",
      "- Issuing banknotes : the ECB holds the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes . Member states can issue euro coins , but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand ( upon the introduction of the euro , the ECB also had exclusive right to issue coins ) .",
      "- Financial stability and prudential policy",
      "- Banking supervision : since 2013 , the ECB has been put in charge of supervising systemically relevant banks .",
      "Monetary policy tools .",
      "The principal monetary policy tool of the European central bank is collateralised borrowing or repo agreements . These tools are also used by the United States Federal Reserve Bank , but the Fed does more direct purchasing of financial assets than its European counterpart . The collateral used by the ECB is typically high quality public and private sector debt .",
      "All lending to credit institutions must be collateralised as required by Article 18 of the Statute of the ESCB .",
      "The criteria for determining high quality for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the European Union : total debt must not be too large in relation to gross domestic product , for example , and deficits in any given year must not become too large . Though these criteria are fairly simple , a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency\u2014or the lack of same .",
      "Difference with US Federal Reserve .",
      "In the United States Federal Reserve Bank , the Federal Reserve buys assets : typically , bonds issued by the Federal government . There is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as commercial paper . The purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for functioning of the financial system .",
      "The Eurosystem , on the other hand , uses collateralized lending as a default instrument . There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term repo contracts . The difference is that banks in effect borrow cash from the ECB and must pay it back ; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually . When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again . An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy . A decrease has the contrary effect . The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Banks balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability . In layman terms , the liability of the central bank is money , and an increase in deposits in member banks , carried as a liability by the central bank , means that more money has been put into the economy .",
      "To qualify for participation in the auctions , banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities . These can be the public debt of member states , but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted . The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union , especially with regard to sovereign debt as a percentage of each member states gross domestic product , are designed to ensure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are , at least in theory , all equally good , and all equally protected from the risk of inflation .",
      "Organization .",
      "The ECB has four decision-making bodies , that take all the decisions with the objective of fulfilling the ECBs mandate :",
      "- the Executive Board ,",
      "- the Governing Council ,",
      "- the General Council , and",
      "- the Supervisory Board .",
      "Decision-making bodies .",
      "Executive Board .",
      "The Executive Board is responsible for the implementation of monetary policy ( defined by the Governing Council ) and the day-to-day running of the bank . It can issue decisions to national central banks and may also exercise powers delegated to it by the Governing Council . Executive Board members are assigned a portfolio of responsibilities by the President of the ECB . The Executive Board normally meets every Tuesday .",
      "It is composed of the President of the Bank ( currently Christine Lagarde ) , the Vice-President ( currently Luis de Guindos ) and four other members . They are all appointed by the European Council for non-renewable terms of eight years . Member of the Executive Board of the ECB are appointed from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters by common accord of the governments of the Member States at the level of Heads of State or Government , on a recommendation from the Council , after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB .",
      "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e1ramo , a Spanish member of the Executive Board since June 2004 , was due to leave the board in early June 2012 , but no replacement had been named as of late May . The Spanish had nominated Barcelona-born Antonio S\u00e1inz de Vicu\u00f1a \u2013 an ECB veteran who heads its legal department \u2013 as Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e1ramos replacement as early as January 2012 , but alternatives from Luxembourg , Finland , and Slovenia were put forward and no decision made by May . After a long political battle and delays due to the European Parliaments protest over the lack of gender balance at the ECB , Luxembourgs Yves Mersch was appointed as Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e1ramos replacement .",
      "In December 2020 , Frank Elderson succeeded to Yves Mersch at the ECBs board .",
      "Governing Council .",
      "The Governing Council is the main decision-making body of the Eurosystem . It comprises the members of the Executive Board ( six in total ) and the governors of the National Central Banks of the euro area countries ( 19 as of 2015 ) .",
      "Since January 2015 , the ECB has published on its website a summary of the Governing Council deliberations ( accounts ) . These publications came as a partial response to recurring criticism against the ECBs opacity . However , in contrast to other central banks , the ECB still does not disclose individual voting records of the governors seating in its Council .",
      "General Council .",
      "The General Council is a body dealing with transitional issues of euro adoption , for example , fixing the exchange rates of currencies being replaced by the euro ( continuing the tasks of the former EMI ) . It will continue to exist until all EU member states adopt the euro , at which point it will be dissolved . It is composed of the President and vice-president together with the governors of all of the EUs national central banks .",
      "Supervisory Board .",
      "The Supervisory Board meets twice a month to discuss , plan and carry out the ECBs supervisory tasks . It proposes draft decisions to the Governing Council under the non-objection procedure . It is composed of Chair ( appointed for a non-renewable term of five years ) , Vice-Chair ( chosen from among the members of the ECBs Executive Board ) four ECB representatives and representatives of national supervisors . If the national supervisory authority designated by a Member State is not a national central bank ( NCB ) , the representative of the competent authority can be accompanied by a representative from their NCB . In such cases , the representatives are together considered as one member for the purposes of the voting procedure .",
      "It also includes the Steering Committee , which supports the activities of the Supervisory Board and prepares the Boards meetings . It is composed by the Chair of the Supervisory Board , Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board , one ECB representative and five representatives of national supervisors . The five representatives of national supervisors are appointed by the Supervisory Board for one year based on a rotation system that ensures a fair representation of countries .",
      "Capital subscription .",
      "The ECB is governed by European law directly , but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital . Its initial capital was supposed to be \u20ac5 billion and the initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the member states populations and GDP , but the key is adjustable . The euro area NCBs were required to pay their respective subscriptions to the ECBs capital in full . The NCBs of the non-participating countries have had to pay 7% of their respective subscriptions to the ECBs capital as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB . As a result , the ECB was endowed with an initial capital of just under \u20ac4 billion . The capital is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders . Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral . The NCBs are the sole subscribers to and holders of the capital of the ECB .",
      "Today , ECB capital is about \u20ac11 billion , which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders . The NCBs\u2019 shares in this capital are calculated using a capital key which reflects the respective members share in the total population and gross domestic product of the EU . The ECB adjusts the shares every five years and whenever the number of contributing NCBs changes . The adjustment is made on the basis of data provided by the European Commission .",
      "All national central banks ( NCBs ) that own a share of the ECB capital stock as of 1 February 2020 are listed below . Non-Euro area NCBs are required to pay up only a very small percentage of their subscribed capital , which accounts for the different magnitudes of Euro area and Non-Euro area total paid-up capital .",
      "Reserves .",
      "In addition to capital subscriptions , the NCBs of the member states participating in the euro area provided the ECB with foreign reserve assets equivalent to around \u20ac40 billion . The contributions of each NCB is in proportion to its share in the ECBs subscribed capital , while in return each NCB is credited by the ECB with a claim in euro equivalent to its contribution . 15% of the contributions was made in gold , and the remaining 85% in US dollars and UK pound Sterlings .",
      "Languages .",
      "The internal working language of the ECB is generally English , and press conferences are usually held in English . External communications are handled flexibly : English is preferred ( though not exclusively ) for communication within the ESCB ( i.e . with other central banks ) and with financial markets ; communication with other national bodies and with EU citizens is normally in their respective language , but the ECB website is predominantly English ; official documents such as the Annual Report are in the official languages of the EU .",
      "Independence .",
      "The European Central Bank ( and by extension , the Eurosystem ) is often considered as the most independent central bank in the world . In general terms , this means that the Eurosystem tasks and policies can be discussed , designed , decided and implemented in full autonomy , without pressure or need for instructions from any external body . The main justification for the ECBs independence is that such an institutional setup assists the maintenance of price stability .",
      "In practice , the ECBs independence is pinned by four key principles :",
      "- Operational and legal independence : the ECB has all required competences to achieve its price stability mandate and thereby can steer monetary policy in full autonomy and by means of high level of discretion . The ECBs governing council deliberates with a high degree of secrecy , since individual voting records are not disclosed to the public ( leading to suspicions that Governing Council members are voting along national lines. ) In addition to monetary policy decisions , the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations , within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled , it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations . The ECBs own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions , and be party of legal proceedings . Finally , the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit .",
      "- Personal independence : the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long ( 8 years ) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years . In addition , ECB board members and are vastly immune from judicial proceedings . Indeed , removals from office can only be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union ( CJEU ) , under the request of the ECBs Governing Council or the Executive Board ( i.e . the ECB itself ) . Such decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct . National governors of the Eurosystem national central banks can be dismissed under national law ( with possibility to appeal ) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct .",
      "- Financial independence : the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income . The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent . The ECBs financial independence reinforces its political independence . Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct monetary financing of public institutions , this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities .",
      "- Political independence : The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks . Symmetrically , EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECBs independence . It is the latter which is the subject of much debate .",
      "Democratic accountability .",
      "In return to its high degree of independence and discretion , the ECB is accountable to the European Parliament ( and to a lesser extent to the European Court of Auditors , the European Ombudsman and the Court of Justice of the EU ( CJEU ) ) . Although no interinstitutional agreement exists between the European Parliament and the ECB to regulate the ECBs accountability framework , it has been inspired by a resolution of the European Parliament adopted in 1998 which was then informally agreed with the ECB and incorporated into the Parliaments rule of procedure .",
      "The accountability framework involves five main mechanisms :",
      "- Annual report : the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the European Parliament , the European Commission , the Council of the European Union and the European Council . In return , the European Parliament evaluates the past activities to the ECB via its annual report on the European Central Bank ( which is essentially a non legally-binding list of resolutions ) .",
      "- Quarterly hearings : the Economic and Monetary affairs Committee of the European Parliament organises a hearing ( the Monetary Dialogue ) with the ECB every quarter , allowing members of parliament to address oral questions to the ECB president .",
      "- Parliamentary questions : all Members of the European Parliament have the right to address written questions to the ECB president . The ECB president provides a written answer in about 6 weeks .",
      "- Appointments : The European Parliament is consulted during the appointment process of executive board members of the ECB .",
      "- Legal proceedings : the ECBs own legal personality allows civil society or public institutions to file complaints against the ECB to the Court of Justice of the EU .",
      "In 2013 , an interinstitutional agreement was reached between the ECB and the European Parliament in the context of the establishment of the ECBs Banking Supervision . This agreement sets broader powers to the European Parliament than the established practice on the monetary policy side of the ECBs activities . For example , under the agreement , the Parliament can veto the appointment of the Chair and Vice-Chair of the ECBs supervisory board , and may approve removals if requested by the ECB .",
      "Transparency .",
      "In addition to its independence , the ECB is subject to limited transparency obligations in contrast to EU Institutions standards and other major central banks . Indeed , as pointed out by Transparency International , The Treaties establish transparency and openness as principles of the EU and its institutions . They do , however , grant the ECB a partial exemption from these principles . According to Art . 15 ( 3 ) TFEU , the ECB is bound by the EU\u2019s transparency principles \u201conly when exercising [ its ] administrative tasks\u201d ( the exemption \u2013 which leaves the term \u201cadministrative tasks\u201d undefined \u2013 equally applies to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to the European Investment Bank ) .",
      "In practice , there are several concrete examples where the ECB is less transparent than other institutions :",
      "- Voting secrecy : while other central banks publish the voting record of its decision makers , the ECBs Governing Council decisions are made in full discretion . Since 2014 , the ECB has published accounts of its monetary policy meetings , but those remain rather vague and do not include individual votes .",
      "- Access to documents : The obligation for EU bodies to make documents freely accessible after a 30-year embargo applies to the ECB . However , under the ECBs Rules of Procedure the Governing Council may decide to keep individual documents classified beyond the 30-year period .",
      "- Disclosure of securities : The ECB is less transparent than the Fed when it comes to disclosing the list of securities being held in its balance sheet under monetary policy operations such as QE .",
      "Location .",
      "The bank is based in Ostend ( East End ) , Frankfurt am Main . The city is the largest financial centre in the Eurozone and the banks location in it is fixed by the Amsterdam Treaty . The bank moved to a new purpose-built headquarters in 2014 , designed by a Vienna-based architectural office , Coop Himmelbau . The building is approximately tall and is to be accompanied by other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the former wholesale market in the eastern part of Frankfurt am Main . The main construction on a 120,000 m\u00b2 total site area began in October 2008 , and it was expected that the building would become an architectural symbol for Europe . While it was designed to accommodate double the number of staff who operated in the former Eurotower , that building has been retained by the ECB , owing to more space being required since it took responsibility for banking supervision .",
      "Debates surrounding the ECB .",
      "Debates on ECB independence .",
      "The arguments in favour of this independence .",
      "The debate on the independence of the ECB has its origins in the preparatory stages of the construction of the EMU . The German government agreed to go ahead if certain crucial guarantees were respected , such as a European Central Bank independent of national governments and shielded from political pressure along the lines of the German central bank . The French government , for its part , feared that this independence would mean that politicians would no longer have any room for manoeuvre in the process . A compromise was then reached by establishing a regular dialogue between the ECB and the Council of Finance Ministers of the euro area , the Eurogroupe .",
      "The founding model of the ECB , as advocated by the German government , is explained in an article published in 1983 by two economists , Robert Barro and David Gordon . According to them , the best way to combat the inflationary bias is for central banks to be credible . This credibility would be all the more important if the central banks were independent , so that decisions are not contaminated by politics . For economists , central banks should then have only one objective : to maintain a low inflation rate . For this system to work , it would then be necessary to assume that a monetary policy conducted in this way would have no effect on the real economy .",
      "Since that publication , it has often been accepted that an independent institution to manage monetary policy can help to limit chronic inflation . This model was generalised in various variations at the national levels before being adopted at the European level .",
      "The original European project , as intended by the founding fathers , did not attract the passions and favours of the European peoples . And rightly so . This project is thought out openly on purely technical subjects that are of little or no interest to public opinion . As a result , the founding fathers hoped that economic and ethical rationality could be exercised in all its fullness without political , ideological or historical obstacles . It is this rational messianism that the radical left has always fought against . Moreover , this project is presented as heir to the Enlightenment and Reason , the reign of human rights , a modernist and voluntarist project stemming from the tradition of the 18th century . In this order of things , the independence of the ECB allowing a rational management of monetary questionnaires outside the political game is a blessing for the supporters of this doctrine . It is difficult , if not impossible , for them to conceive of a democratisation of the ECB by attaching to it a share of political control in its operation without distorting the European Project , this bible , this unique political reason which has guided professionals in Europe for generations .",
      "In this same idea , we can find in the European Project the Kantian tradition with a model of successful subordination of political power to the law , leading to what Habermas calls the civilising force of democratic legalification . This Habermatian theory leads us once again to isolate supranational institutions from political games . Indeed , for Habermas , European politics , like national politics for that matter , finds it impossible to define ONE uniform people , but at best a pluriform people in constant opposition , each component against the other . For this author , popular sovereignty is illusory , as is the concept of government by the people . He prefers the search for a broad consensus legitimized by the majority of democratically elected representatives of the people . This explains his attachment to deflecting the influence of popular emotions from technical institutions , such as the ECB .",
      "The arguments against too much independence .",
      "An independence that would be the source of a democratic deficit. .",
      "Demystify the independence of central bankers :According to Christopher Adolph ( 2009 ) , the alleged neutrality of central bankers is only a legal fa\u00e7ade and not an indisputable fact . To achieve this , the author analyses the professional careers of central bankers and mirrors them with their respective monetary decision-making . To explain the results of his analysis , he utilizes he uses the principal-agent theory . To explain that in order to create a new entity , one needs a delegator or principal ( in this case the heads of state or government of the euro area ) and a delegate or agent ( in this case the ECB ) . In his illustration , he describes the financial community as a shadow principale which influences the choice of central bankers thus indicating that the central banks indeed act as interfaces between the financial world and the States . It is therefore not surprising , still according to the author , to regain their influence and preferences in the appointment of central bankers , presumed conservative , neutral and impartial according to the model of the Independent Central Bank ( ICB ) , which eliminates this famous temporal inconsistency . Central bankers had a professional life before joining the central bank and their careers will most likely continue after their tenure . They are ultimately human beings . Therefore , for the author , central bankers have interests of their own , based on their past careers and their expectations after joining the ECB , and try to send messages to their future potential employers .",
      "The crisis : an opportunity to impose its will and extend its powers :",
      "\u2013 Its participation in the troika : Thanks to its three factors which explains its independence , the ECB took advantage of this crisis to implement , through its participation in the troika , the famous structural reforms in the Member States aimed at making , more flexible the various markets , particularly the labour market , which are still considered too rigid under the ordoliberal concept .",
      "- Macro-prudential supervision : At the same time , taking advantage of the reform of the financial supervision system , the Frankfurt Bank has acquired new responsibilities , such as macro-prudential supervision , in other words , supervision of the provision of financial services .",
      "-Take liberties with its mandate to save the Euro : Paradoxically , the crisis undermined the ECBs ordoliberal discourse because some of its instruments , which it had to implement , deviated significantly from its principles . It then interpreted the paradigm with enough flexibly to adapt its original reputation to these new economic conditions . It was forced to do so as a last resort to save its one and only raison d\u00eatre : the euro . This Independent was thus obliged to be pragmatic by departing from the spirit of its statutes , which is unacceptable to the hardest supporters of ordoliberalism , which will lead to the resignation of the two German leaders present within the ECB : the governor of the Bundesbank , Jens WEIDMANN and the member of the Executive Board of the ECB , J\u00fcrgen STARK .",
      "\u2013 Regulation of the financial system : The delegation of this new function to the ECB was carried out with great simplicity and with the consent of European leaders , because neither the Commission nor the Member States really wanted to obtain the monitoring of financial abuses throughout the area . In other words , in the event of a new financial crisis , the ECB would be the perfect scapegoat .",
      "- Capturing exchange rate policy : The event that will most mark the definitive politicization of the ECB is , of course , the operation launched in January 2015 : the quantitative easing ( QE ) operation . Indeed , the Euro is an overvalued currency on the world markets against the dollar and the Euro zone is at risk of deflation . In addition , Member States find themselves heavily indebted , partly due to the rescue of their national banks . The ECB , as the guardian of the stability of the euro zone , is deciding to gradually buy back more than EUR 1 100 billion Member States public debt . In this way , money is injected back into the economy , the euro depreciates significantly , prices rise , the risk of deflation is removed , and Member States reduce their debts . However , the ECB has just given itself the right to direct the exchange rate policy of the euro zone without this being granted by the Treaties or with the approval of European leaders , and without public opinion or the public arena being aware of this .",
      "In conclusion , for those in favour of a framework for ECB independence , there is a clear concentration of powers . In the light of these facts , it is clear that the ECB is no longer the simple guardian of monetary stability in the euro area , but has become , over the course of the crisis , a multi-competent economic player , at ease in this role that no one , especially not the agnostic governments of the euro Member States , seems to have the idea of challenging . This new political super-actor , having captured many spheres of competence and a very strong influence in the economic field in the broad sense ( economy , finance , budget... ) . This new political super-actor can no longer act alone and refuse a counter-power , consubstantial to our liberal democracies . Indeed , the status of independence which the ECB enjoys by essence should not exempt it from a real responsibility regarding the democratic process .",
      "The arguments in favour of a counter power .",
      "In the aftermath of the euro area crisis , several proposals for a countervailing power were put forward , to deal with criticisms of a democratic deficit . For the German economist German Issing ( 2001 ) the ECB as a democratic responsibility and should be more transparent . According to him , this transparence could bring several advantages as the improvement of the efficiency and of the credibility by giving to the public adequate information . Others think that the ECB should have a closer relationship with the European Parliament which could play a major role in the evaluation of the democratic responsibility of the ECB . The development of new institutions or the creation of a minister is another solution proposed :",
      "A minister for the Eurozone ?",
      "The idea of a eurozone finance minister is regularly raised and supported by certain political figures , including Emmanuel Macron , as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel , former President of the ECB Jean-Claude Trichet and former European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici . For the latter , this position would bring more democratic legitimacy and more efficiency to European politics . In his view , it is a question of merging the powers of Commissioner for the Economy and Finance with those of the President of the Eurogroup .",
      "The main task of this minister would be to represent a strong political authority protecting the economic and budgetary interests of the euro area as a whole , and not the interests of individual Member States . According to the Jacques Delors Institute , its competences could be as follows :",
      "- Supervising the coordination of economic and budgetary policies",
      "- Enforcing the rules in case of infringement",
      "- Conducting negotiations in a crisis context",
      "- Contributing to cushioning regional shocks",
      "- Representing the euro area in international institutions and fora",
      "For Jean-Claude Trichet , this minister could also rely on the Eurogroup working group for the preparation and follow-up of meetings in euro zone format , and on the Economic and Financial Committee for meetings concerning all Member States . He would also have under his authority a General Secretariat of the Treasury of the euro area , whose tasks would be determined by the objectives of the budgetary union currently being set up",
      "This proposal was nevertheless rejected in 2017 by the Eurogroup , its President , Jeroen Dijsselbloem , spoke of the importance of this institution in relation to the European Commission .",
      "Towards democratic institutions ?",
      "The absence of democratic institutions such as a Parliament or a real government is a regular criticism of the ECB in its management of the euro area , and many proposals have been made in this respect , particularly after the economic crisis , which would have shown the need to improve the governance of the euro area . For Mo\u00efse Sidiropoulos , a professor in economy : \u201cThe crisis in the euro zone came as no surprise , because the euro remains an unfinished currency , a stateless currency with a fragile political legitimacy\u201d .",
      "French economist Thomas Piketty wrote on his blog in 2017 that it was essential to equip the euro zone with democratic institutions . An economic government could for example enable it to have a common budget , common taxes and borrowing and investment capacities . Such a government would then make the euro area more democratic and transparent by avoiding the opacity of a council such as the Eurogroup .",
      "Nevertheless , according to him there is no point in talking about a government of the euro zone if we do not say to which democratic body this government will be accountable , a real parliament of the euro zone to which a finance minister would be accountable seems to be the real priority for the economist , who also denounces the lack of action in this area .",
      "The creation of a sub-committee within the current European Parliament was also mentioned , on the model of the Eurogroup , which is currently an under-formation of the ECOFIN Committee . This would require a simple amendment to the rules of procedure and would avoid a competitive situation between two separate parliamentary assemblies . The former President of the European Commission had , moreover , stated on this subject that he had no sympathy for the idea of a specific Eurozone Parliament ."

      "Nogan turned professional at Oxford United under Maurice Evans . He joined Brentford on loan in March 1987 , and spent the remainder of the 1986\u201387 season at Griffin Park , scoring two goals in 11 Third Division games for Steve Perrymans Bees . He then played four matches and scored one goal as the Us were relegated out of the First Division at the end of the 1987\u201388 season under the stewardship of Mark Lawrenson .

He also returned to Southend United on loan , now in the First Division and under the stewardship of Peter Taylor . Again his stay at Roots Hall was brief however , and he played just five games for the Seasiders . He returned to Vicarage Road and scored nine goals from 15 appearances in the first half of the 1994\u201395 campaign .",
      "Reading .",
      "Nogan was sold on to Reading for \u00a3250,000 in January 1995 . He scored 12 goals in 23 appearances , including a hat-trick in a 3\u20133 draw with Port Vale at Elm Park , to help the Royals to secure a second-place finish in the First Division at the end of the 1994\u201395 season . A reduction in the size of the Premier League denied the club automatic promotion however , and though they eliminated Tranmere Rovers in the play-off semi-finals , they lost out to Bolton Wanderers in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium . Nogan had put Reading ahead in the fourth minute with the first goal of the game , and by half time they were 2\u20130 up , but two goals in the final 15 minutes saw Bolton force extra-time and go on to claim a 4\u20133 victory . Reading then struggled in the 1995\u201396 campaign , only managing a 19th-place finish , with Nogan contributing 11 goals from his 45 appearances . He went on to score a further six goals across 25 appearances in the 1996\u201397 season , as joint-managers Mick Gooding and Jimmy Quinn led the club to an 18th-place finish . Nogan also enjoyed a spell on loan with Notts County , playing six games during his short stay at Meadow Lane as the Magpies struggled at the foot of the Second Division .",
      "Grimsby Town .",
      "Nogan signed with Grimsby Town for a \u00a3170,000 fee in August 1997 , with manager Alan Buckley looking to replace Clive Mendonca . He formed effective partnership with Jack Lester , and scored 13 goals in 54 appearances across the 1997\u201398 season to help the Mariners to reach the Second Division play-off final at Wembley Stadium . There they defeated Northampton Town 1\u20130 to secure promotion . He also played in the 1998 Football League Trophy final , as Grimsby won the Football League Trophy for the first time with a 2\u20131 extra-time victory over A.F.C . Bournemouth . However he struggled back in the First Division , scoring just three goals in 42 matches across the 1998\u201399 campaign , as he failed to adapt to the pace and physicality of the higher division . A lack of other options at Blundell Park left him unable to be replaced up front and caused him to receive criticism from some supporters as his confidence dipped .",
      "Darlington .",
      "Nogan joined Darlington on a free transfer in July 1999 . A strike partnership with veteran forward Marco Gabbiadini failed to materialise however , as loan signings such as Craig Russell were preferred by Quakers manager David Hodgson , though Nogan still featured 39 times in the 1999\u20132000 season , contributing five goals . He came on as an 84th minute substitute for Peter Duffield in the Third Division play-off final , as Darlington lost 1\u20130 to Peterborough United . Shortly after Gary Bennett took charge at Feethams at the start of the 2000\u201301 season , Nogan was allowed to leave the club on a free transfer .",
      "Luton Town .",
      "Nogan moved back up to the Second Division to Luton Town as one of manager Lil Fuccillos first signings at Kenilworth Road . On 19 December , he opened the scoring as Luton defeated his former club Darlington 2\u20130 in the second round of the FA Cup . He scored against another former club four days later , though this was during a 4\u20131 defeat at Reading . He played just 11 times for the Hatters and scored just the two goals , as Luton suffered relegation at the end of the 2000\u201301 season under the stewardship of Joe Kinnear .",
      "York City .",
      "Nogan signed with York City in February 2001 ; manager Terry Dolan said that we needed a striker.. . with Chris Iwelumo finishing his time here it would have left us with just David McNiven and Scott Emmerson.. . Lee is experienced and hopefully that will help David McNiven and it also gives Alex Mathie a lot more breathing space to fully recover before he comes back . He proved to be a key player in the clubs upturn in form in the second half of the 2000\u201301 season , displaying hunger and a high work-rate as he scored six goals from 16 appearances . He scored 13 goals from 49 appearances for the Minstermen throughout the 2001\u201302 season , and made a further 50 appearances in the 2002\u201303 campaign , scoring six goals .",
      "He was released in May 2003 following what were described as drastic cost-cutting measures , though he ended up staying on at the club as a player and assistant manager to rookie manager Chris Brass . He finished as Yorks top-scorer in the 2003\u201304 season with nine goals , although he was unable to prevent them from suffering relegation out of the Football League to the Conference . He remained at Bootham Crescent after relegation , and scored three goals from 24 games in the 2004\u201305 season , before leaving the club when caretaker-manager Viv Busby was succeeded by Billy McEwan in February . He went on to join Conference North side Harrogate Town in March 2005 after being signed by manager Neil Aspin , his former teammate at Darlington . He later played for Pickering Town , who were managed by former York teammate Alex Mathie .",
      "International career .",
      "Nogan won caps for the Wales under-21 and B team , before he won his first senior Wales cap in 1992 . He picked up his second and final cap three years later .",
      "Coaching career .",
      "Whitby Town .",
      "Nogan was appointed as manager of Whitby Town in June 2006 . He led the club to an 11th-place finish in the Northern Premier League Premier Division at the end of the 2006\u201307 season , though they did suffer early cup qualification exits to Frickley Athletic and Woodley Sports . The Blues suffered a poor start to the 2007\u201308 campaign , and Nogan resigned on 22 October 2007 following an FA Trophy defeat at Ossett Town . Despite being a former manager , he continued to play for the club , helping them to avoid relegation at the end of the season . He served as assistant manager to manager Graeme Clark during the 2008\u201309 season , and continued to make first-team appearances .",
      "Assistant to Neil Aspin .",
      "Nogan went on to work as assistant to F.C . Halifax Town manager Neil Aspin . On 1 October 2014 , now aged 45 , he came on as a 7th-minute substitute in a 3\u20130 defeat at Guiseley in the first round of the West Riding County Cup , and was taken off to be replaced by Aspin on 69 minutes . Aspin was appointed as Gateshead manager on 27 November 2015 , and the following day he hired Nogan to again work as his assistant . Having been recruited by League Two club Port Vale , Aspin again took Nogan with him to work as a coach on 6 October 2017 . He departed Vale Park alongside Aspin on 30 January 2019 .",

      "Li Sizhong ( ichthyologist )",
      "Li Sizhong ( ; February 19 , 1921 \u2013 January 11 , 2009 ) was an ichthyologist with the Institute of Zoology ( ) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences . Throughout his research career , he made numerous discoveries of new fish species ( or subspecies ) , and published many books and research papers describing the fauna and geographical distribution of fishes in China and beyond . He translated and helped publication of the Chinese editions of Fishes of the World ( 2nd edition , by Joseph S . Nelson ) and Fish Migration ( a popular science book by Russian zoologist Peter Schmidt ) . Li was the major author of two published volumes in the monograph series , systematically reviewing and describing orders of bony fishes that include flat fish , cod , silverside , pearlfish , killifish , flying fish , etc . in or near China . He had written over 40 popular science articles about fish on Chinese newspapers and magazines , and been responsible for compiling and editing fish-related entries in several standard reference books ( including Encyclopedia of China ) .",
      "Career and research .",
      "Right after finishing graduate studies in ichthyology in 1950 , Li initially worked on Chinese nomenclature of vertebrates , specializing in fishes , within the publication office of the newly-formed Chinese Academy of Sciences . Later in the year , he joined a team of zoologists ( including Tso-hsin Cheng ) engaged in consolidating and sorting out zoological specimen inherited from Fan Memorial Institute of Biology and National Academy of Peiping , two predecessors of the Academy of Sciences , in preparation of the later formation of the Institute of Zoology .",
      "Starting from the early 1950s , Li helped to initiate and participated in Chinas systematic surveys of marine fishes in Bohai Sea , Yellow Sea and South China Sea , along Chinas coast . His scientific career , however , was interrupted in 1957 when he was labelled a rightist during the Anti-Rightist Movement . From then until the mid-1970s , while his research and publication capacity had been severely impacted by whims of political campaigns and turmoils , he managed to conduct surveys of freshwater fishes in the Yellow River , Ou River and Ling River , as well as in interior regions such as Xinjiang",
      "and Gansu provinces . While blacklisted as a rightist and assigned to work on aquaculture-related research in the early 1960s , he discovered a salmonid fish serendipitously in the vicinity of Qinling Mountains ( considered to be a glacial refugium roughly in central part of China ) , which is later named Brachymystax tsinlingensis Li , 1966 . For a relatively tranquil period of about a year before the Cultural Revolution , he was allowed to publish research results related to the salmonid fish , fishes in the Yellow River , and earlier surveys of marine fishes . But only until after the Cultural Revolution , Li was able to resume normal research activities .",
      "In his book Studies on zoogeographical divisions for fresh water fishes of China , Li divided the fauna of freshwater fishes in China into five major regions based on characteristics of fish species distributions , geographic environments and geological histories of these regions . According to his method , the demarcation line between Holarctic and Indomalayan realms in China , as far as freshwater fishes are concerned , lies largely along the Himalayas and Nanling Mountains ranges . This contrasts with the prevalent view of demarcation line between Holarctic and Indomalaya regions ( known as Qinling\u2013Huaihe Line ) along the Qinling Mountains , even though the latter does not extend into Eastern part of China . Freshwater Ecoregions of the World ( FEOW ) , a collaborative global biodiversity project partly sponsored by World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , cites this book as a source of references in delineation of freshwater ecoregions of China .",
      "Two of his books are published posthumously . In Fishes of the Yellow River and Beyond , he described over 170 native fish species and the characteristics of fish distribution in the Yellow River and its tributaries ; a collection of his papers and popular science articles , as well as a personal memoir , are also included in the posthumous book published in Taiwan ; this book was re-published in the mainland in 2017 . Comparing fish species in the Yellow River in 2010\u20132015 and the survey results originally reported by Li in 1965 as part of his research on the book , two recent Chinese studies conclude that only about half of the native fishes in the Yellow River could still be found , due to anthropogenic environmental alterations and increased presence of introduced species over the past half-century . Li was also the primary contributor to a volume of the Fauna Sinica series covering the orders of Atheriniformes , Cyprinodontiformes , Beloniformes , Ophidiiformes and Gadiformes , which was published posthumously in 2011 . Another volume of the Fauna Sinica series which he worked on during his last years , covering fish species in China within the orders of Beryciformes , Zeiformes , Lampriformes , Gasterosteiformes , Mugiliformes and Synbranchiformes ( such as soldierfish , dory , opah , ribbonfish , stickleback , mullet , swamp eel , etc. ) , is yet to be published ."

      "Miller M . Duris ( March 2 , 1928 \u2013 March 23 , 2014 ) was an American politician in the state of Oregon . A native Oregonian , he served as mayor of Hillsboro , Oregon , and as chairman of the Washington County Board of Commissioners in the 1970s and 1980s . He served in the United States Navy and worked for nearly 30 years at Tektronix .",
      "Early life .",
      "Miller Michael Duris was born on March 2 , 1928 , in Rainier , Oregon , along the Columbia River to John and Mary ( n\u00e9e Duhon ) Duris , who emigrated from what is now Slovakia . After growing up in Rainier , he joined the United States Navy at the age of 17 in 1945 . While in the Navy he took classes on electronics that eventually led to a job at Tektronix and served on the USS Achernar before leaving the Navy in 1949 .",
      "During his naval service he began sending letters to Celestine Sally Weverka of Hillsboro , and the two married on October 11 , 1948 . The couple had six daughters , Cheryl , Carin , Cynthia , Carol , Colleen , and Cathy . Duris began working for Hillsboros Meltebekes Furniture after leaving the Navy , and then starting working for Tektronix in 1951 where he would work as a technical writer . Duris began managing Tektronix\u2019s Washington , D.C. , office and the family moved to Virginia in 1959 , but returned to Hillsboro in 1967 . He started the Pigtail-Ponytail softball group for girls in 1969 , which is now the Hillsboro Girls Softball Association . Duris remained involved in the group until 1988 , and himself played in softball leagues until 2009 .",
      "Political career .",
      "In 1969 , he entered politics and was appointed to the Hillsboro City Council . He won re-election to the council in November 1970 , running unopposed for the position . Duris then ran for mayor in 1972 , defeating Kenneth Stuart in the November election and taking office on January 2 , 1973 . During this time he owned Millers Sweet Shop from 1971 to 1974 , and left Tektronix in 1977 . In November 1974 , he won re-election over A . T . Antonelli to a second two-year term as mayor . He along with the other members of the council , and PayLess Drug , were sued over a land use decision , with the case reaching the Oregon Court of Appeals in 1975 , where he and the other defendants prevailed . Also while he was mayor , he officiated at the dedication of Bicentennial Park on October 19 , 1976 .",
      "A Democrat , he decided to run for the at-large commissioner position on the Washington County Commission in 1976 . He won the Democratic nomination over Deneice Won in the May primary , and then defeated Republican Allan Paterson in the general election in November . While serving on the commission he became a member of the Columbia Region Association of Governments as the county\u2019s representative to the multi-state organization .",
      "On January 4 , 1978 , Duris was elected as chairman of the county commission . That year voters approved changes to the county charter , with the commission converting to a three-member , full-time commission in 1979 . In November 1978 , Duris announced he would run for the new county commission , and then won election to the reconstituted commission in January , which had a special two-year term . Duris then ran for the new at-large commissioner position in 1980 in order to be chair .",
      "By November 1980 he was no longer the chairperson of the commission , and in 1981 the commission was to change back to five positions , though only the chairperson would be a full-time position . Duris lost the race to be chair to Virginia Dagg , and left office in January 1981 . He declined to run again for the commission in 1982 . Duris tried to re-enter politics when he ran for a spot on the school board of the Hillsboro Union High School District ( now part of the Hillsboro School District ) in March 1986 .

      "Li Kwoh-ting",
      "Li Kwoh-ting ( ; 28 January 1910 \u2013 31 May 2001 ) was a Taiwanese economist and politician best known as the Father of Taiwans Economic Miracle and referred to by the New York Times as the Godfather of Technology in Taiwan for his work in transforming Taiwans economy from an agrarian-based system into one of the worlds leading producers of information and telecommunications technology .",
      "Biography .",
      "Li was born in Nanjing , Qing China , on January 28 , 1910 and died at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei , Taiwan on May 31 , 2001 .",
      "He graduated from National Central University ( Nanjing University ) in 1930 and studied physics at Cambridge University in 1934 . He returned to Mainland China and spent many years in politics and economics before he fled from the Chinese Communist Party to Taiwan in July 1948 with the Nationalist Party . He became the president of the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation in 1951 and was appointed as a member of the Industrial Development Commission responsible for the planning and economic development of Taiwan in 1953 . In 1959 he became the head of the Industrial Development and Investment Center under the Council for United States Aid .",
      "He held a number of leadership positions in industry and government in Taiwan , including that of economic minister from 1965 to 1969 and finance minister from 1969 to 1976 . After 1976 he was appointed Minister without portfolio and promoted science and technology in Taiwan . In 1968 , he received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for government service . He created a policy that helped attract entrepreneurs in the tech industry and helped fund Taiwans electronics companies , which led to Taiwans primacy as a producer of computer parts . Li also helped build the Hsinchu Science Park , which later became known as Taiwans Silicon Valley . The park is one of the worlds leading centers for semiconductor manufacturing and industrial and computer technology development . As of 2018 more than 500 high-tech companies reside in the park . Li was also a senior adviser to the President of the Republic of China , Chen Shui-bian .",
      "Economic policy .",
      "In total , Li was a government official for 40 years , 10 of which he spent in Mainland China before the Chinese Communist Party won the civil war . Tony Fu-Lai Yu speculates that the time Li spent in Mainland China , as well as his science-based university education , greatly influenced his policy-making in Taiwan . Li had no formal training in economics , thus most of his knowledge of economic management was gained from practical experience and working with other economists . Consequently , Yu argues his policy was insulated from popular economic ideology and instead was driven by pragmatism . Li himself also claims that the purpose of his writings is to reveal his policy-making experiences for the future reference of other developing countries , and did not engage in writing about economic , administrative , or political science theory .",
      "Yu argues that Lis policy-making can be explained by evolutionary economics . Two Yale economists , Gustav Ranis and John C.H . Fei , wrote the introductory essays to Lis 1995 book The Evolution of Policy Behind Taiwans Development Success . Therefore , it can be interpreted that Ranis and Feis views on economic policy are representative of Lis .",
      "Ranis mainly writes on neo-classical growth theory , which claims that a steady economic growth rate can be achieved by correctly balancing the driving forces of labor , capital , and technology . He also writes on the concept of agricultural labor surplus economies which , in freeing up workers and generating agricultural surplus and leading to increased productivity in expanding commercial sectors .",
      "Fei argues that two main types of forces govern policy evolution : objective and subjective . Objective forces are predetermined conditions , encompassing physical environments , external economic conditions , etc . Subjective forces include personal beliefs , economic knowledge , memories , experiences , and common sense . Fei believes that political beliefs and ideology are the strongest factors in shaping economic policy-making , and thus is an ongoing process . In following with the concept of evolutionary economics , Fei believes that economic policy must change to suit new and ever-changing situations . Therefore , policy should not be static when created and instead evolve and be improved on to adapt to new situations . Li himself claims that the liberalization of the Taiwanese economy was a gradual process rather than an abrupt one following the international fad of free market ideology in the 1960s and 1970s .",
      "Pragmatic economics .",
      "Li argues that there are two types of issues central to analyzing policy evolution . First is the economic impact of a policy , second is causation , or why a certain policy appears and is implemented at a certain time .",
      "Li believes pragmatism should supersede ideology in terms of policy-making: [ Policy innovation should be based on ] the anticipation of impending problems and conflicts , rather than be purely ideologically motivated . . . The very notion of an evolution of policy suggests that the timing ( or timely appearance ) of a particular policy is important , and a good policy innovation is one that does not arrive prematurely . Ideological considerations often get in the way of appropriate timing as , for example , with so-called welfare state legislation that the economy simply cannot support . What can almost be called a rejection of ideology lies at the heart of a healthy pragmatism that has guided policymakers in Taiwan and has supported a social consensus for growth and economic liberalization.He argues against ideology-based policy making because it often interferes with the timing of certain policies , and all too often change too quickly . He believes such policy is \u201cmotivated by goals considered larger than people\u2019s actual well-being,\u201d which is a scathing review of ideology-based policy . Rather than ideology , Li believes the economic environment in which policies are made is more important and that policy should not be restricted by the ulterior motives of ideology-based economics .",
      "Policy revision .",
      "Lis trial and error policy making was made possible by Taiwans flexible government policy . Li says that it made it possible to abandon or modify ineffective programs and easily create and implement new ones in reaction to new situations .",
      "Lis policies were often influenced by his experiences as part of the Kuomintang in Mainland China . Hyperinflation was one of the major reasons that Chiang Kai-shek lost Mainland China to the Communist Party , and thus Li abhorred all inflationary finance during his management of Taiwans economy .",
      "His aversion to relying on inflation is apparent in his claim:Taiwan\u2019s experience shows that fiscal reforms ( tax legislation ) and monetary reforms ( moving toward central bank autonomy ) are major evolu- tionary steps taken by a responsible government . . . What underlies both reforms is a rejection of the insanity of relying on the printing press to create purchasing power for the government to use in an effort to solve socioeconomic problems.Li indicates that this was the main difference between Taiwans policy and those in Latin American countries , and that this method of managing the economy led to an overall more responsible government and transparent taxation system . Li claims that during the 1950s\u201370s , the liberalization of Taiwans economy was an unintended effect of their new policy , and it wasnt until 1983 that such externally-oriented growth was seen as beneficial and the merging of international competition in the domestic market was encouraged . Furthermore , Li says that Taiwans government was guided at the start with the principle that private property and a market environment which favored private businesses were to be encouraged . Li writes:Other promotional measures taken by the government included improving the investment climate , simplifying administrative procedures . . . providing necessary financing through banking institutions , and promoting investment and exports through tax relief and other incentives.This was the framework for Lis Principle of Peoples Livelihood where the importance of protecting private property for the improvement of socioeconomic activities and establishing a free economy was only superseded by the need to expand state capital . Yu claims that this view falls under what Robert Wade calls the guided market economy . Li argues that the main problem with other less developed countries ( LDCs ) was that:The alleged failure of the market in some other LDCs may , in fact , be due precisely to the opposite reason : the failure of political intervention in the market . Although the market structure was far from perfect at the beginning of transition growth in the 1950s , the overall trend has been for a strengthening of the market mechanism\u2014a depoliticizing of the market . Taiwan experience shows that reduced intervention can work.Li argues that without the same willingness in developing countries to support a free market , Taiwans economic miracles and history are useless to them .",
      "Governments role .",
      "Li explains that Taiwans economic development was initially set back by the scarcity of natural resources , shortages of capital and foreign exchange , technological backwardness , and lack of entrepreneurial skills , however , through the governments direct involvement and encouragement , the infrastructure and incentives needed for private enterprises to flourish , including mitigation of risk , was created:Among the major initiatives have been : the formulation of investment program and the provision of low-interest loans ; the establishment of industrial zones , export-processing zones , and the science-based industrial park ; Ten Major Development Projects , the Twelve New Development Projects and the Fourteen Key Projects in the 1970s and 1980s . The government also adopted various supplementary fiscal , financial , foreign-exchange , and trade-promotion measures to quicken the pace of industrialization.Taiwans government made certain to not compete with private enterprises unless absolutely necessary , and the most lucrative investment projects were left for private businesses to take . Many times the government would first conduct feasibility studies before offering low interest loans to private entrepreneurs . Other times the government acted as sole owner of a business before handing it over to private investors .",
      "However , Li was a strong believer that it was important for the government to step back once the private sector became more established . Fiscal policy would then become more of a stabilizing and equilibrating mechanism to counterbalance fluctuations in private economic behaviour . The evolution of fiscal policy in Taiwan has followed the same progression . . . with government intervention diminishing as the economy moved steadily in the direction of liberalization .",
      "This leads to Lis argument that there are two main major roles played by the government in economic development :",
      "1 . Enforcement of competition : To promote competition in small developing countries , it is best to open up the economy and expose domestic enterprises to international competition . Li believes anti-trust laws are superfluous in open economies . In new industries , government protection should only be given in the initial period .",
      "2 . Identify the areas of production characterized by externality ( activities where the producers of the goods or services cannot easily charge those who benefit--this is somewhat different from the common view of externality ) : Goods with external effect are not fixed and will mature with the economy . Thus , government operated sectors can become more privatized as the economy matures , although it is reasonably difficult to decide what the government should provide based on external economies , and therefore should remain an ongoing task .",
      "Transferability .",
      "On the topic of Taiwans economic success being transferable to other developing countries , Li believes that:...While our policy experiences cannot be transferred to LDCs as a whole package , individual measures ( such as EPZs and investment incentives ) that I introduced have , from time to time , been adopted successfully by neighbouring countries [ ... ] If an experience can be transferable at all , the key question concerns the circumstances under which the policy is instituted . If the circumstances are too different , it is not likely that the policy will lead to the same result . The question of a policy\u2019s result is an economic issue , but the way policy is formulated is a political issue . Good economics can be rejected by bad politics . Hence , whether or not Taiwan\u2019s policy experience can be transferred to other developing economies depends very much on whether their cultures can allow pragmatism to overcome ideology as well as on how strongly they are dedicated to political and economic freedom.Although Taiwan experienced relative economic success over the course of its history along with the other Four Asian Tigers which employed similar economic policies as Taiwan , the lack of the same miraculous development in Latin American countries that employed the same principles brings into question whether Lis policies can be fully transferred and result in unequivocal success . Li also did not consider external factors that helped Taiwans initial economic growth , such as the economic and military aid provided by the US government from 1949\u20131965 , which helped to dampen inflation .",
      "Economic achievement .",
      "Taiwan experienced GDP growth of 10.6% a year from 1965 to 1979 with no deterioration in income distribution , an improvement in literacy , a longer life expectancy than almost all other developing countries , increases in manufacturing earnings of 15% a year from 1960 to 1979 , and unemployment at less than 2% since 1970 . As of 1988 , income per person was three to ten times higher than China . In 1953 Taiwans per capita income was below the Mediterranean countries , and well below any Latin American country and Malaysia , whereas by 1982 Taiwans per capita income had reached US$2500 , much higher than Malaysia , Brazil , and Mexico , and on par with Portugal , Argentina , and Chile .",
      "In 1973 manufacturings share in NDP was 36% , high even by standards of industrialized countries . Exports consisted of over half of GDP and consist of 90% of industrial goods , including textiles , clothes , leather and wood products , radio , television , cassette recorders , electronic calculators , sewing machines , machine tools , semi-conductors , and computers . This was a stark change from 1955s exports , which were 90% agricultural , consisting of mainly sugar and rice .",
      "Ian Little writes , Government expenditure fell from 19.6% of GNP in 1963 to 16% in 1973 , whereas [ in 1979 ] revenue rose from 21% to 22.4% . According to Wade however , government expenditure as a share of GNP increased from 20% in 1963 to 23% in 1973 and to 27% in 1980\u201381 . However , government revenue increased from 19.3% in 1963 to 25.8% in 1973 .",
      "Criticisms .",
      "Taiwans three-year stimulus package in 1991 to boost the private sector was NT $40 billion ( US$1.5 billion ) and included loans to small and medium-sized business and NT $20 billion for high-tech enterprises . The package also released 30,000 hectares of government owned land to the private sector , offered a five-year tax holiday to high-tech industries , allowed more foreign workers in to supplement the labor shortage in construction and manufacturing , and allowed more semi-finished industrial goods to be imported from Mainland China to be processed in Taiwan . The goal of the plan was to maintain the expansion of Taiwans GDP and private investment from falling below their then annual levels of 6\u20137% and 10\u201315% .",
      "Critics of the plan included those who worked in manufacturing companies , saying that , The governments plans are so rough that at the industrial level we cant work with its programs . One such vice-president said that because large private-sector companies planned several years in advance , government policies that are vague and unpredictable can easily go awry . He adds that the amount of funding offered by the government cant make a dent in what the private sector really needs .",
      "Other critics included businessmen who claimed the plan would only benefit big corporations and not the 97% of manufacturing companies that were small and medium-sized . They argued that the Cabinet was not counteracting the larger obstacle to private sector growth : the Central Banks anti-inflation policy with high interest rates and tight liquidity . A manager of a computer parts company said , Its easier to raise money in China than here .",
      "Furthermore , there has been considerable criticism on the viability of one best practice policy to which every developing country should adhere . Ha-Joon Chang argues that many already developed countries did not in fact reach their current development level through using the policies and institutions which they recommend , but in fact actively used bad trade and industrial policies , such as infant industry protection and export subsidies . Chang proposes that many of the institutions which are regarded as necessary for economic development are the effect and not the cause of economic development . Chang concludes by suggesting that policies be catered to developing countries depending on their stage of development and needs , rather than by using a blanket set of policies .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Lis residence in Taipei is now a museum . The traditional 1930s style Japanese house was Lis home from 1972 to 2001 . Taipeis former mayor , Hau Lung-bin , recalls fondly , I was so impressed by its furnishings [ ... ] They showed how prudent he was , and he read plenty of books and periodicals . Additionally , to further honor Li , in 2011 an asteroid ( ) was named after him .",
      "Four professorships at Stanford University are also named for Dr . Li in the fields of economic development , engineering , medicine and Chinese culture . As of 2014 , the holders in each field are : economic development ( Xueguang Zhou ) , engineering ( Yinyu Ye ) , medicine ( Stanley N . Cohen ) and Chinese culture ( Mark Edward Lewis ) ."

      "FC Flora , commonly known as Flora Tallinn , or simply as Flora , is a professional football club based in Tallinn , Estonia , that competes in the Meistriliiga , the top flight of Estonian football . The clubs home ground is A . Le Coq Arena .",
      "Formed in 1990 , Flora were founding members of the Meistriliiga , and are one of two clubs which have never been relegated from the Estonian top division , along with Narva Trans . Flora have won more trophies than any other club in Estonian football , with a record 13 Meistriliiga titles , eight Estonian Cups and a record eleven Estonian Supercups .",
      "History .",
      "Early history ( 1990\u20132000 ) .",
      "Flora was founded on 10 March 1990 by Aivar Pohlak as an effort to revive Estonian football during the dissolution of the Soviet Union . The team was mainly based on players from L\u00f5vid youth team . Flora finished their first season in last place and were relegated . The situation changed after the formation of the Meistriliiga in 1992 . After 52 years of foreign occupation , Estonian clubs could once again play for the Estonian League Championship title . Flora finished the inaugural season of the Meistriliiga in fourth place . After the first season , the league was reformed to run from Autumn to Spring . Flora finished the 1992\u201393 season as runners-up . In 1993 , Roman Ubakivi was appointed as manager . One round before the end of the 1993\u201394 season , Tevalte , who led the Meistriliiga table at the time , was controversially disqualified over allegations of match fixing . The season ended with Flora and Norma both on equal 36 points . Flora won the championship play-off match 5\u20132 and was awarded their first league title . The club made their European debut in the 1994\u201395 UEFA Cup , losing to Odense 0\u20136 on aggregate in the preliminary round . Flora managed to defend the league title in the 1994\u201395 season and won the 1994\u201395 Estonian Cup , defeating Lantana-Marlekor 2\u20130 in the final .",
      "In January 1996 , Teitur Thordarson replaced Ubakivi as manager . Disappointing start in the 1995\u201396 season left the team in second place . Flora finished the 1996\u201397 season as runners-up once again . In the 1997\u201398 season , the club won their first league title under Thordarson . Subsequently , the league format was changed and Flora managed win another title in the same calendar year . Flora made their debut in the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the 1998\u201399 season , narrowly losing to Steaua Bucure\u0219ti 4\u20135 on aggregate in the first qualifying round . The club added another Estonian Cup trophy after defeating Lantana 3\u20132 in the finals . Since 1999 , Meistriliiga adopted the current league format with the season running from Spring to Autumn within a single calendar year . The 1999 season was unsuccessful as Flora placed third . In 2000 , Tarmo R\u00fc\u00fctli was appointed as manager . Under R\u00fc\u00fctli , Flora finished the 2000 season as runners-up , behind Levadia who won the title without a single loss .",
      "New stadium and a new era ( 2001\u20132009 ) .",
      "In 2001 , a new era began for Flora as the club moved to the new A . Le Coq Arena and R\u00fc\u00fctli was replaced by Arno Pijpers . Under Pijpers , Flora won three consecutive Meistriliiga titles in 2001 , 2002 and 2003 . In the 2003 season , Flora won the league without losing a single league match , extending their unbeaten run from the previous season to 37 , while Tor Henning Hamre scored a record 39 goals in a season . Pijpers left Flora in September 2004 , before the end of the 2004 season , and was replaced by Janno Kivisild . The team failed to defend the league title for another season , finishing in third place .",
      "The 2005 season was unsuccessful as Flora placed fourth , 26 points behind the league champions TVMK . This was the first time Flora didnt win a Meistriliiga medal since 1992 . After the disappointing season , Kivisild was replaced by Pasi Rautiainen . In the 2006\u201307 UEFA Cup , Flora defeated Lyn Oslo 1\u20131 on aggregate on away goals in the first qualifying round , before losing to Br\u00f8ndby 0\u20134 on aggregate in the second qualifying round . The club finished the 2006 season in third place and placed second in the 2007 season . In 2007 , Flora also suffered their biggest margin of defeat in the Meistriliiga thus far , losing 0\u20136 to TVMK . Flora finished the 2008 season as runners-up , behind Levadia once again , despite amassing 91 points and scoring 113 goals . Tarmo R\u00fc\u00fctli returned to Flora for the 2009 season , but failed to lead the club to winning the league , placing fourth . Flora were more successful in the Estonian Cup , winning the trophy in 2008 and 2009 .",
      "Recent history ( 2010\u2013present ) .",
      "In 2010 , R\u00fc\u00fctli was replaced by the former Flora player and Estonia national team record cap holder Martin Reim . Under Reim , rejuvenated Flora ended the reign of Levadia who had won the four previous Meistriliiga titles and won the league in the 2010 season . Flora successfully defended their title in the 2011 season and won the 2010\u201311 Estonian Cup , defeating Narva Trans 2\u20130 in the final . Flora finished the 2012 season in third place , behind the champions N\u00f5mme Kalju and Levadia . After the season , Reim left the club and was replaced Marko Lelov in December 2012 . Lelov won the 2012\u201313 Estonian Cup , but was sacked in July 2013 after disappointing results in the league . He was replaced by Norbert Hurt , initially as a caretaker , with position being made permanent later . Flora finished the 2013 season in fourth place and placed third in 2014 .",
      "In 2015 , Flora celebrated their 25th anniversary by winning their 10th league title in the 34th round of the season . The club also won the 2015\u201316 Estonian Cup , defeating Sillam\u00e4e Kalev 3\u20130 in extra time in the final . In May 2016 , Aivar Pohlak resigned from the clubs presidency and was succeeded by his son Pelle Pohlak . In the first qualifying round of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League , Flora lost to Lincoln Red Imps 2\u20133 on aggregate , after which Hurt resigned and was replaced by Argo Arbeiter . Flora finished the disappointing 2016 season in fourth place . Arbeiter was sacked and in January 2017 , Arno Pijpers to take over as manager . In the 2017 season , Flora won their 11th Meistriliiga title . In December 2017 , it was announced that Pijpers will not continue as manager and J\u00fcrgen Henn was appointed in his place in January 2018 .

      "Jimmy Lai",
      "Lai Chee-Ying ( , born 8 December 1947 ) , also known as Jimmy Lai , is a Hong Kong entrepreneur and activist . He founded Giordano , an Asian clothing retailer , Next Digital ( formerly Next Media ) , a Hong Kong-listed media company , and the popular newspaper Apple Daily . He is one of the main contributors to the pro-democracy camp , especially to the Democratic Party . Although he is known as a Hong Kong political figure , he has been a UK national since 1996 . Lai is also an art collector .",
      "A prominent critic of the Chinese Communist Party , Lai was arrested on 10 August 2020 by the Hong Kong police on charges of violating the territorys new national security law , an action which prompted widespread criticism.After that , Lai was allow to bail in 12 August . But in 3 December , Lai was accused fraudulent charges and no longer allowed to bail . The court decided to jail Lai until April 2021 . This is the first time Lai has been detained . Lai regarded the prison life as \u201cthe pinnacle of his own life\u201d .",
      "In December 2020 , Lai was awarded Freedom of Press Award by Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) for his role in founding Apple Daily , a news media under Lais pro-democracy leadership that still dares to openly criticise the Chinese regime and which widely covered last years pro-democracy protests .",
      "On 29 December , Lai resigned from his roles with Next Digital as director and chairman of the board .",
      "Early life .",
      "Lai was born in Guangzhou , China on 8 December 1947 . At the age of 12 , he entered Hong Kong as a stowaway on a boat . Upon his arrival , Lai began work as a child labourer in a garment factory for a wage of the equivalent of US$8 per month . Lai is a practising Catholic .",
      "Founding of Giordano .",
      "Lais factory work saw him rise to the position of factory manager . In 1975 , Lai used his year-end bonus on Hong Kong stocks to raise cash and bought a bankrupt garment factory , Comitex , where he began producing sweaters . Customers included J.C . Penney , Montgomery Ward , and other U.S . retailers .",
      "By rewarding sellers with financial incentives in Hong Kong , he built the chain into an Asia-wide retailer . Giordano was said to have more than 8,000 employees in 2,400 shops in 30 countries .",
      "Lai has kept Comitex active as a shell company since he left the garment industry for media and politics in the 1990s . After his arrest under National Security Law in August 2020 , Lai tried to sell his asset in Hong Kong , including the entire floor of Tai Ping Industrial Centre . The current owner of the property is Comitex Knitters Ltd . Comitex , along with other private companies controlled by Lai , was reported to be the financial tools for his political activities and donations .",
      "Publications .",
      "Lai pioneered a reader-centric philosophy with paparazzi journalism in Hong Kong based on publications such as USA Today and The Sun . His best-selling Next Magazine and Apple Daily newspaper featured a mix of racy tabloid material and news items oriented to the mass market with plenty of colour and graphics that attracts a wide range of readers , some of whom are also critics of Lai and his ideology .",
      "Hong Kong publications .",
      "Owing to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 , Lai became an advocate of democracy and critic of the Peoples Republic of China government . He began publishing Next Magazine , which combined tabloid sensationalism with hard-hitting political and business reporting . He proceeded to found other magazines , including Sudden Weekly ( \u5ffd\u7136\u4e00\u9031 ) , Eat & Travel Weekly ( \u98f2\u98df\u7537\u5973 ) , Trading Express/Auto Express ( \u4ea4\u6613\u901a/\u6435\u8eca\u5feb\u7dda ) and the youth-oriented Easy Finder ( \u58f9\u672c\u4fbf\u5229 ) .",
      "In 1995 , as the Hong Kong handover approached , Lai founded Apple Daily , a newspaper start-up that he financed with $100 million of his own money . The newspapers circulation rose to 400,000 copies by 1997 , which was the territorys second largest among 60 other newspapers . According to Lai , he aspired to maintain freedom of speech in Hong Kong through Apple Daily . In addition to promoting democracy , Lais publications often ruffled feathers of fellow Hong Kong tycoons by exposing their personal foibles and relations with local government .",
      "In 2003 , ahead of the record-breaking pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong during July , the cover of Next Magazine featured a photo-montage of the territorys embattled chief executive Tung Chee-Hwa taking a pie in the face . The magazine urged readers to take to the streets while Apple Daily distributed stickers calling for Tung to resign .",
      "In 2006 , Sudden Weekly and Next Magazine ranked first and second in circulation for Hong Kongs magazine market . Apple Daily became the No . 2 newspaper in Hong Kong .",
      "In 2020 , Lai launched an English version of Apple Daily .",
      "However Next Digital , the list company , has struggled with huge financial deficit for years , with cumulative losses in the past five years exceeding .",
      "Taiwan publications .",
      "Lai launched Taiwanese editions of Next Magazine in 2001 and Apple Daily in 2003 , taking on heavily established rivals who made considerable effort to thwart him . Rival publishers pressed advertisers to boycott and distributors not to undertake home delivery . His Taiwan offices were vandalised on numerous occasions . As the publications grew to have the largest readership in their category , the advertising boycotts ended .",
      "In October 2006 , Lai launched Sharp Daily ( Shuang Bao in Mandarin ) , a free daily newspaper targeting Taipei commuters . The company also launched Me ! Magazine in Taiwan .",
      "In building Taiwans most popular newspaper , Apple Daily , and magazine , Next Magazine , Lais racy publications were described as having a great impact on the countrys hitherto staid media culture .",
      "Publication challenges .",
      "Lais publications remained banned in China since their inception . The ban originated from Lais 1994 newspaper column , where he told Premier of the PRC Li Peng , seen as a driving force behind the Tiananmen Square crackdown , to drop dead . He also called the Communist Party of China a monopoly that charges a premium for lousy service . Chinas government retaliated against Lai by starting a shut-down of Giordano shops , prompting him to sell out of the company in order to save it . In addition to having his publications banned in China , businesses had distanced themselves from placing advertisements in Apple Daily to avoid retaliation from the Chinese government .",
      "Lai had frequently faced hostility from the many Beijing-backed tycoons , including attempts to force supplier boycotts of his companies . Major Hong Kong property developers and top companies advertised only in competing publications not owned by Lai . He also faced a lengthy battle to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , which Lai sidestepped through a reverse takeover . He managed to list the company in 1999 by acquiring Paramount Publishing Group in October of that year .",
      "Other companies .",
      "During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s , Lai started an Internet-based grocery retailer that offered home delivery services , adMart . The business expanded its product scope beyond groceries to include electronics and office supplies , but was shut down after losing between $100 and $150 million . Lai attributed this business failure to overconfidence and a lack of viable business strategy .",
      "In 2011 , Next Media reportedly sold 70 per cent stake of Next Medias subsidiary Colored World Holdings ( CWH , incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ) to Sum Tat Ventures ( STV , incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ) , a private company 100 per cent owned by Jimmy Lai . CWH was estimated to have net asset value of US$6.1 million . STV paid US$100 million in cash for 70 per cent stake of CWH . In 2013 , STV paid another US$20 million for the remaining 30 per cent stake of CWH . CWH itself had its assets sold in 2011 , and ceased operation in 2011 . In total , STV paid US$120 million in cash for CWH . On Lais Form 3B disclosure form , STV is listed as having the same correspondence address as Next Media in Hong Kong .",
      "Near the end of 2013 , Lai spent approximately US$73 million ( or NT$2.3 billion ) to purchase a 2 per cent stake ( ~17 million shares ) in Taiwanese electronics manufacturer HTC .",
      "Activities in Myanmar .",
      "In 2014 , leaked documents showed Jimmy Lai paid former US deputy defence secretary and former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz US$75,000 for his help with projects in Myanmar . Lai also reportedly remitted approximately US$213,000 to businessman Phone Win , with whom Lais Hong Kong-registered Best Combo company reportedly collaborated on Yangon real estate projects .",
      "Political activity in Hong Kong .",
      "Lai is a longtime champion of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement . According to Lai , The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek inspired him to fight for freedom . His advocacy had been expressed through his business ventures , such as distributing Giordano t-shirts with portraits of student leaders . His high-profile support for the pro-democracy movements came under strong condemnation from the Chinese government .",
      "On 13 December 2014 , Lai was one of the pro-democracy leaders arrested during the clearance of the Admiralty protest site of the Umbrella Movement . On the following day , Lai announced he would step down as head of Next Media to spend more time with his family and further pursue his personal interests .",
      "Lai had been the target of hostile attacks and disturbances , including the leaving of machetes , axes and threatening messages in his driveway . He had been rammed by a car , and his home was firebombed several times , most recently in 2019 . Next Media spokesman Mark Simon condemned these attacks and stated , This is a continual effort to intimidate the press in Hong Kong . This is raw and pure intimidation . Some activists felt that the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong government , which have been Chinese-controlled since the handover in 1997 , did not always follow up on these misconducts against Lai , and that culprits are rarely found .",
      "During the early hours of 12 January 2015 , two masked men hurled petrol bombs at Lais home on Kadoorie Avenue in Kowloon Tong . At the same time , a petrol bomb was thrown at the Next Media headquarters in Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate . The fires were extinguished by security guards . The perpetrators fled and two cars used in the attacks were found torched in Shek Kip Mei and Cheung Sha Wan . The crimes were denounced as an attack on press freedom .",
      "Between July and November 2019 Lai was able to meet with US Vice President Mike Pence and later with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to discuss the Hong Kong protests . Pelosi published a photograph of herself , Lai , along with Martin Lee and Janet Pang and supporting words to the Hong Kong protesters .",
      "On 28 February 2020 , Lai was arrested for illegal assembly during his attendance in the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests , and for allegedly intimidating an Oriental Daily reporter after the reporter took photos of him in 2017 . His case was scheduled to be heard at Eastern Law Court on 5 May . On 18 April 2020 , Lai was among 15 high-profile democracy figures arrested in Hong Kong . According to a police statement , his arrest was based on suspicion of organising , publicizing or taking part in several unauthorized assemblies between August and October 2019 .",
      "On 3 September 2020 , Lai was found not guilty of the Oriental Daily criminal intimidation charge .",
      "National security law and arrests .",
      "On 30 June 2020 , the Hong Kong national security law was enacted by Chinas parliament , by-passing the Legislative Council of Hong Kong . Before the law was enacted , Lai called it a death knell for Hong Kong and alleged that it would destroy the territorys rule of law .",
      "On 10 August 2020 , Lai was arrested at his home for alleged collusion with foreign forces ( a crime under the new national security law ) as well as fraud . Other Next Digital staff were also arrested , and police searched the home of both Lai and his son . Later in the morning , approximately 200 Hong Kong police officers raided the offices of Apple Daily in Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate , seizing around 25 boxes of materials . HSBC took the step to freeze his bank account .",
      "After Lai was arrested , the stock price of Next Digital rose as high as 331 per cent on 11 August . Bail was set at HK$300,000 ( approx . US$38,705 ) , with a surety of HK$200,000 ( approx . US$25,803 ) . Apple Daily said that more than 500,000 copies of its subsequent days paper were printed , five times the usual number . The front page of Apple Daily showed an image of Mr Lai in handcuffs with the headline : Apple Daily must fight on .",
      "The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office , an agency of mainland China , welcomed the arrest and called for Lai to be severely punished . The Hong Kong Journalists Association described the raid as horrendous and unprecedented in Hong Kong . The Democratic Party accused the government of trying to create a chilling effect in the Hong Kong media industry . Former governor Chris Patten called the events the most outrageous assault yet on Hong Kongs press . The head of the University of Hong Kong journalism department called the raid an outrageous , shameful attack on press freedom .",
      "Other pro-democracy figures were arrested for national security crimes on the same day , including Agnes Chow , Wilson Li , Andy Li , and at least four others .",
      "On 2 December 2020 , Lai reported to the police station as part of his bail condition for his August arrest related to on-going national security law violation but was immediately arrested by police for alleged fraud , in that he and two Next Digital executives allegedly violated lease terms for Next Digital office space . Police referred to a further investigation into possible national security law violation against one of the three , apparently referring to Lai . The case was adjourned until April 2021 , with Lai being denied bail .",
      "On 11 December 2020 , Lai became the first high-profile figure to be charged under the new national security law for allegedly conspiring and colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security . The main evidence for those charges , according to the prosecutors , consisted of statements that Lai had made on Twitter .",
      "On 23 December 2020 , Lai was granted bail by the High Court with the following conditions : HK$10 million deposit ; HK$100,000 deposit by each of his three guarantors ; To remain at his home at all times , except when reporting to police or attending court hearings ( de facto house arrest ) ; Surrender all travel documents ; Banned from attending or hosting media interviews or programmes ; Banned from publishing articles on any media , posting messages or comments on social media , including Twitter ; Report to police thrice a week .",
      "On 31 December 2020 , the Court of Final Appeal ordered him back to prison after the Department of Justice , under prosecutor Anthony Chau Tin-hang , appealed his release on bail . On 9 February 2021 , Hong Kongs top court denied his bail ; a new bail application by Lai was rejected on 19 February .",
      "On 16 February , Lai was arrested while in prison for alleged violations of the national security law , including a charge of aiding activist Andy Li in his ill-fated attempt to escape to Taiwan with eleven others in August 2020 .",
      "On 1 April 2021 , he was convicted on a separate case over unlawful assembly during the 2019 protests along six other activists and politicians . On 16 April 2021 , he was sentenced to 14 months in prison for the unauthorised assembly charge . As the sentencing was carried out , friends and family shouted stand strong and other words of support .",
      "In May 2021 , Lais assets were all frozen by the Hong Kong government , including all the shares of Next Digital Limited and the property and local bank accounts of three companies owned by him . On 28 May 2021 , Lai was sentenced to additional 14 months imprisonment over his role in an unauthorised assembly in 2019 . He must now serve 20 months in prison .",
      "Art collection .",
      "Lai is also known as an art collector , especially known for a collection of over 1000 pieces of Walasse Ting . Ting created around 4000 pieces throughout his life and out of these 4000 , 1000 are in Lais collection . They had befriended since the 1980s , and Lai had been a supporter for Ting financially and emotionally . There are many works by Ting in the headquarters of Next Digital in Hong Kong and in Taiwan .",

      "Orchard Supply Hardware",
      "Orchard Supply Hardware ( OSH ) was an American retailer of home improvement and gardening products . Headquarters were in San Jose , California , Orchard Supply Hardware had dozens of locations throughout California , with expansions into Oregon and Florida .",
      "After starting as a non-profit cooperative in 1931 , the company later converted into a for-profit corporation before it was bought and sold by a number of different corporations during the 1980s . In 1996 , the company was acquired by Sears . After a brief period as a public company in 2012\u201313 , the company filed for a Chapter 11 reorganization . In 2013 , the bulk of OSHs assets and locations were purchased by the home improvement store chain , Lowes . For the next five years , the chain was operated as a subsidiary of Lowes and used for strategic expansion of retail operations . All stores were closed in November 2018 .",
      "In January 2020 , the Memphis-based Central Network Retail Group purchased the OSH brand from Lowes .",
      "History .",
      "Orchard Supply was formed in 1931 as the Orchard Supply Farmers Co-op by 30 farmers , consisting mostly of orchardists and fruit tree ranchers who banded together to form a cooperative to buy essential farm supplies . Each farmer put up $30 and in the midst of the Great Depression a new company was formed . Stanley B . Smith served as the companys first general manager and president .",
      "Operations started in a rented warehouse at 230 Bassett St . in San Jose , CA . In spite of the Great Depression , the cooperative was successful . In 1933 the co-op moved to a larger location at 44 Vine St . in San Jose . The new location featured a large retail display area , off-street parking , and an adjoining warehouse .",
      "In 1946 the company moved to a site at 720 West San Carlos St . in San Jose . By then , there were almost 2000 members . In 1962 , Albert B . Smith ( Stanleys son ) became president , expanding the business into a chain of stores which , at each , were considered large at the time .",
      "By 1950 the electronics industry began booming in the Santa Clara Valley , and with it came an abundance of new home owners in the San Francisco Bay Area . The orchards gradually became residential neighborhoods , and the Orchard Supply Farmers Co-op became a for-profit corporation , Orchard Supply Hardware retail stores .",
      "In 1977 , the company purchased a 19-acre warehouse and office complex from Sunsweet Growers to serve as a distribution center . In the 1980s , Loren S . Smith ( another son of Stanley ) became President and continued the expansion . In 1992 the distribution center was moved to Tracy , CA .",
      "On August 22 , 2018 , Lowes publicly announced that Orchard Supply Hardware would be closed down nationwide , and would begin liquidation . It said stores would be closed by the following February , and all had been closed by November .",
      "In 2019 , Central Network Retail Group ( CNRG ) purchased leases to 7 former OSH locations in the San Jose area . These new stores were to be called Outdoor Supply Hardware , and kept a similar appearance and experience as the old OSH stores . By 2020 , the chain expanded to 11 locations .",
      "Operations .",
      "Mergers and acquisitions .",
      "Orchard Supply Hardware ceased to be a privately owned company when it and its seven stores were acquired by W.R . Grace and Company in 1979 . W.R . Grace operated the company seven years before it sold the company along with another hardware chain to the Wickes Companies in 1986 . Wickes operated the company for three years before selling the company to its managers in 1989 .",
      "OSH was purchased by Sears in 1996 after seven years of independence . In 2005 , Sears sold a 19.9% interest in the company to Ares Management of Los Angeles for US$58.7 million , announcing expansion plans at the time . Ares had the option to later purchase another 30.2% stake in the company for US$126.8 million , but did not exercise this right . OSH had eighty-four stores at the time .",
      "At roughly the same time , Sears Holdings announced that its Sears , Roebuck & Co . subsidiary expected to receive a dividend from OSH of about US$450 million . In connection with the initial investment , OSH was expected to issue US$405 million in debt . This debt was later cited as one of the primary reasons for its 2013 Chapter 11 filing .",
      "Later several of the Southern California locations of the bankrupt Builders Emporium chain of hardware stores were purchased in preparation of expansion into that region . OSH was spun out of Sears Holdings in 2012 and became a public company . In January 2012 shares began trading on the Nasdaq stock market ( ) .",
      "Expansion .",
      "In April 2013 , OSH expanded beyond California , opening stores in the suburban Portland metropolitan area of Oregon . In November 2014 , the company opened its first location in the city of San Francisco . The North Beach store located at 2598 Taylor St . is a former Petco and has a planned June 2015 opening . The store represents a new strategy for Lowes to enter urban regions and markets using the OSH brand . This was following the opening of a store in the population dense Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles .",
      "Reorganization .",
      "On June 17 , 2013 , Orchard Supply Hardware announced it filed for Chapter 11 under the U.S . bankruptcy code and that most of its assets would be sold to the Lowes Home Improvement chain for $205M in cash . Lowes agreed to acquire no fewer than sixty of the ( at the time ) ninety-one Orchard Supply stores , operating them separately from Lowes . At the close of the process , Orchard Supply remained a separate brand and operating entity from the Lowes chain .",
      "In August 2013 , preparations were made to close seventeen of the ninety-nine stores . Two of the stores were closed in June as a part of normal operations . This left seventy of the pre-Chapter 11 announcement stores still in operation . According to a company spokesperson , workers at the stores that closed were not eligible for severance pay due to the bankruptcy proceeding , but Orchard Supply is providing incentive bonuses to key employees . Lowes also committed to investing US$200 million in OSH over the next five years .",
      "In 2016 , Lowes announced the expansion of the Orchard brand to South Florida .",
      "Technology .",
      "Via a technology program launched initially by Lowes in 2014 , OSH announced a pilot program using robot employees at their San Jose store at 377 Royal Ave . The devices , called OSHbots , were supplied by a Mountain View company called Fellow Robots . The OSHbots resembled white columns with two large LCD screens and were equipped with 3D cameras , so they could identify items brought in by customers , and had wheels on either side that helped them move . Customers could research items on the screens and then the robot could lead them to the aisle where an item was located . The robots spoke English and Spanish and were connected to an inventory database so they could inform customers if an item was out of stock .",
      "The robots were the result of a process that Lowes uses for new developments . According to Lowes Innovation Labs director Kyle Nel , What we actually do is use a process called science fiction prototyping , where we give all our marketing research and trend data to professional published science fiction writers . The OSHbots were not meant to replace humans , but Nel also stated , We have amazing [ OSH ] store associates , but.. . they probably dont know the real time location of every single object in the store .",
      "Marketing .",
      "Boxcar .",
      "In the early 1960s , the City of San Jos\u00e9 denied Al Smith permission to install a sign along Auzerais Street to promote his Orchard Supply Hardware store because a sign for the store already existed facing San Carlos Street . Undeterred , Smith bought a railroad boxcar from Southern Pacific , painted the car with the OSH logo , and placed it at the end of the spur track behind his store and alongside Auzerais Street . It remained in that spot for nearly 50 years , and was occasionally featured in OSH\u2019s promotional material . Recognizing its historic relationship to the San Jos\u00e9 community , OSH donated the boxcar to the California Trolley and Railroad Corporation in 2013 for display in History Park at Kelley Park .",
      "Calendars .",
      "Originally conceived as a marketing program , company president , Al Smith who had worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad , had a love of trains and is credited with the theme . One aspect that initially made these calendars unique was that all original paintings were commissioned as artwork for each month . The theme of these calendars has primarily been trains and railroad history , with only a few diversions , including the 1981 calendar which celebrated the Santa Clara Valley . Other images have featured landscapes , steam-powered machines , automobiles , historical drawings , produce from the Santa Clara Valley .",
      "From 1975 until 1992 , railroad artist and local politician Michael Kotowski created each painting with the exception of the 1977 and 1979 calendars . The 1977 edition was a selection of \u201cStill Live\u201d paintings by the Santa Cruz Art League and the 1979 edition was a series of Southwestern style paintings by Northern California artist Anthony Quartuccio , Sr . The 1982 calendar had a flight and aviation theme called \u201cUp , Up and Away\u201d for which Kotowski created the original artwork even though it was not train related . Kotowski did the layout design and production on the entire series under his tenure as artist .",
      "OSHs calendars have featured the works of twenty-three different artists who have created over 450 unique pieces including railroad artists such as Kotowski , John Winfield , James R Mann , 2017 Calendar , and Ken Muramoto ; Muramoto has the distinction of being the youngest artist to provide paintings for the calendar ."

      "Sydney Trains K set",
      "The Sydney Trains K sets are a class of electric multiple unit operated by Sydney Trains in New South Wales . The carriages are of stainless steel , double deck construction , and currently the oldest in the Sydney Trains fleet .",
      "Design & construction .",
      "The K sets were the first New South Wales suburban trains to be air conditioned and have headlights .",
      "Two orders were placed for the K sets with all manufactured in 1981\u201385 by A Goninan & Co , Broadmeadow :",
      "- Order 1",
      "- Order 2",
      "The first order featured low mounted upper deck windows , cream and brown interiors , and unpainted fronts . The second order featured higher mounted upper deck windows , yellow and mustard interiors and State Rail Authority candy livery fronts .",
      "The first four trailers were built as driving trailers allowing them to operate in two-car formation , although in practice they were formed into four carriage sets and often ran together as one eight-car set until 1988 . These also differed in the subsequent deliveries in being fitted with air conditioning from new , rather than pressure ventilation . To provide a spare , C3550 & T4216 were also built with air conditioning . All ten carriages were fitted with different windows , being sheet glass with small opening hoppers . This was replaced with sheet glass in 1993 .",
      "To accommodate the air conditioning and associated equipment , the pantograph had to be shifted to the adjacent trailer car to which the power car is semi-permanently coupled with high voltage cables connecting the two cars . Although some power cars and trailers have been broken up and married with others during periods of heavy maintenance , many original combinations remain .",
      "The control carriages have a flat front , with headlights at the top . They were built with four sets of marker lights , standard at the time . Different combinations of white marker lights were used to indicate different destinations . Flip-dot destination displays were installed later on , which covered the upper middle marker light . Since destination displays have been installed , marker light combinations are no longer necessary , so usually only the two upper marker lights are used . However , some trains still retain the switch for the lower marker light . The front of the train also has an emergency door for the guard compartment and windscreen wipers for the driver window only . Hoses and receptacles are provided below the windows to connect another set , since , unlike newer trains , the coupler does not carry electrical or air connections .",
      "Like other trains of the time , the crew compartment contains a smaller compartment for the driver on the left side ( in direction of travel ) . The guard uses the area outside of the drivers compartment , with two manual hinged doors on either side providing access to platforms . Above these doors , on the outside are blue lights indicating which compartment the guard is in .",
      "Each vestibule has two-panel sliding doors on either side . Each door also has a vent underneath the window , which was covered when air-conditioning was installed . The doors cannot detect obstacles and continue pushing against the obstruction until it is removed or the guard reopens the doors . Small orange LEDs are located above the doors on the outside that flash when the doors are closing . They assist the guard in locating doors that havent closed successfully . All trains were retrofitted with traction interlocking , meaning the driver cannot apply power when the doors are open .",
      "In service .",
      "All K sets are crewed with a driver and guard . The guard uses the rear cab on a 2 or 4 car train . On 8 car trains , the guard usually uses the 5th carriage so that the entire platform can be seen . However the 4th carriage cab can also be used if there is a problem with the 5th carriage one.All the K sets were delivered to either Hornsby or Punchbowl depots . With the trials on the ten experimental carriages judged successful , in 1986 a programme commenced to retrofit air conditioning to the second order . This saw the Beclawat windows replaced with sheet glass . It would be July 1990 before the programme was completed .",
      "In April 1989 , K sets commenced operating peak-hour services via the North Shore line to Gosford . This was extended to Wyong in January 1992 . In September 1990 , all Punchbowl based sets were transferred to Hornsby .",
      "In January 1991 , four sets were transferred to Flemington Maintenance Depot to operate peak-hour Illawarra line services to Port Kembla .",
      "To replace U sets on stopping services between Gosford and Newcastle , the sets with driving trailers were remarshaled as two-car sets from October 1996 .",
      "Following the delivery of the outer suburban Tangara sets in 1994 , the K sets ceased operating the Central Coast and Illawarra services .",
      "During the late 1990s , all were refurbished by A Goninan & Co as part of the CityDecker program . This saw the interiors refurbished with white walls and ceilings , grey floors and blue seats . Power cars received a destination indicator and had yellow applied to the lower half of their fronts . Sliding Beclawat windows on the pressure ventilated cars were replaced with hopper windows and doors painted yellow . The first order was finally retrofitted with air conditioning just prior to the Sydney 2000 Olympics . These cars retained the hopper windows until the late 2000s , but were sealed shut with an adhesive to avoid the loss of air conditioning .",
      "After the introduction of a new timetable in October 2009 , all K sets were allocated to Hornsby to operate North Shore , Northern & Western line services , operating in 8-car formations . This was due to the noise levels inside trains when operating on the Epping to Chatswood segment . Older S sets lack sufficient sound insulation for passengers , while newer Tangara sets dont have sufficient cooling in the regenerative braking system to deal with extended shuttle runs through the tunnel .",
      "In mid-2014 , K sets are gradually transferred from Hornsby to Flemington resulting in their resumption of service on the Airport , Inner West & South , Bankstown , Carlingford and Olympic Park lines . K60 to K86 were previously running these lines , based out of Flemington Depot . Prior to 2017 , K87-99 continued to run part-time on the T1 North Shore , Northern & Western lines .",
      "In October 2013 , the 2 car K Sets ( K1-4 ) were withdrawn from NSW TrainLink Gosford to Newcastle services . The four driving trailers were converted to ordinary trailers at Hornsby and the sets returned to service on Sydney Trains services in March 2014 as K98 and K99 . The existing K98 was renumbered K91 . The driver cabins in these carriages were stripped of controls however the actual walls were kept intact . The doors to the driver cabin are kept locked and the blinds are kept down . There are no passenger seats where the crew compartment used to be . Also , unlike converted S set cars , the round window on the crew compartment doors were removed and covered with a metal plate .",
      "In July 2017 , asbestos was found in the circuit breaker panels , which is inside the driver compartment of the K sets , with all withdrawn for inspection for a few weeks . All have since returned to service .",
      "After the introduction of a new timetable in November 2017 , all K sets were transferred to Sector 2 .",
      "In late 2017 and early 2018 , all K sets and C sets were slightly refurbished with all poles and other safety features repainted yellow .",
      "K sets operate on the following lines :",
      "- T2 Inner West & Leppington Line : Leppington or Parramatta to City Circle via Granville",
      "- T3 Bankstown Line : Liverpool or Lidcombe to City Circle via Bankstown",

      "Brightons first home win of the season came on 31 January 2021 , a 1\u20130 victory over Tottenham with Leandro Trossard scoring the only goal of the game and to take all three points at Falmer Stadium for the first time since a 2\u20131 victory over Arsenal on 20 June 2020 . 3 days later , The Seagulls beat defending champions Liverpool 1\u20130 at Anfield for the first time in their history and the first league win at Liverpool since 1982 with Steven Alzate scoring his first ever Premier League goal . Brighton drew their home fixture against Liverpool on 28 November , earlier in the season , meaning that The Seagulls went unbeaten by the champions in the 2020\u201321 campaign . On 20 April , Brighton drew away against Chelsea finishing 0\u20130 , with the Sussex side claiming their first ever point at Stamford Bridge . On the same night Chelsea pulled out of the proposed plans of the European Super League with Potter saying about the competition , We feel it stands against everything we know as football . Praising the protesting Chelsea fans prior to kick off , Credit to the fans for making their case , and the quicker we get back to playing for points the better . We were a little bit delayed but the supporters are the most important thing . 2 days later , while attending a press conference Potter appeared to have suffered a facial injury with a cut just below his left eye . I would love to be able to tell you that there\u2019s a heroic , chivalrous story here , that I can make myself look really good , but unfortunately I just missed my footing walking home on some steps and then went crashing into a metal railing , joking that his modelling days were already long gone . On 18 May , with fans returning to The Amex , Brighton came from 2\u20130 down to defeat champions Manchester City 3\u20132 , with Dan Burn scoring the winner with his first ever goal for the club . This was Brightons first league victory over the Sky Blues since 1989 and achieved their first ever Premier League win without captain Lewis Dunk in the side , who was out suspended . Brighton lost 2\u20130 away at Arsenal in the next game in which was the last game of the season . Potters second year in charge of The Albion finished with a record equalling points tally of 41 points , which they also achieved the season before , however , they finished in 16th , a place below the previous season . Brighton scored 40 goals in the Premier League , conceding 46 , with a \u20136 goal difference and keeping 12 clean sheets , all being new club record statistics for Brighton while playing in the Premier League .",
      "Managerial style .",
      "Potter has been recognised for his progressive and unconventional coaching methods . At \u00d6stersund , he encouraged his players and staff to engage in community activities , such as performing in theatre and music productions designed to take them out of their comfort zone .",
      "Potter describes his teams as tactically flexible , attacking , [ and ] possession-based . At \u00d6stersund , he deployed a flexible 3\u20135\u20132 formation centred on ball possession . Former Celtic and Barcelona player Henrik Larsson commented on Potters pattern of play , stating he played all different kinds of systems , starting off a match one way , and then halfway through they started playing a different system , and then they ended up with a third system . And all the players knew exactly what they were doing .",
      "At Swansea , Potter used ten different formations and his team completed the most passes per 90 minutes in the Championship .",
      "As a young coach , Potter studied the training methods of Roberto Mart\u00ednez at Swansea and became inspired by his possession-based approach , along with the holistic training principles he observed during his travels to Spain . Potter also cites the philosophy of Pep Guardiola and Raymond Verheijens periodisation model among his influences .",

His work on pricing of priority service for electric power has been implemented in the utility industry .",
      "Wilsons 1968 Econometrica paper The Theory of the Syndicates influenced a whole generation of economics , finance , and accounting students . The paper poses a fundamental question : Under what conditions does the expected utility representation describe the behavior of a group of individuals who choose lotteries and share risk in a Pareto-optimal way ?",
      "He has published about a hundred articles in professional journals and books since completing his education . He has been an associate editor of several journals , and delivered several public lectures .",

      "The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Wilson and Paul Milgrom as the co-recipients of the 2020 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for having improved auction theory and invented new auction formats , beneftting sellers , buyers and taxpayers around the world . Alvin Roth ( an economist who was a co-recipient of the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize and who had Wilson as his doctoral advisor ) said that Wilson and Milgrom havent just profoundly changed the way we understand auctionsthey have changed how things are auctioned . Specifically , the Academy acknowledged Wilsons efforts in analyzing common value auctions , where bidders derive a common value from the underlying resource , and his theoretical proofs that bidders tend to bid lower than their best estimates of common value , in order to avoid the winners curse . Some examples of common value auctions include radio frequency spectrum , and minerals .",
      "Memberships and awards .",
      "He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences , a designated distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association , and a fellow , former officer and Council member of the Econometric Society .

      "The Edgley EA-7 Optica is a British light aircraft designed for low-speed observation work , and intended as a low-cost alternative to helicopters . The Optica has a loiter speed of 130 km/h ( 70 kn ; 81 mph ) and a stall speed of 108 km/h ( 58 kn ; 67 mph ) .",
      "Design and development .",
      "The Optica project began in 1974 with a company , Edgley Aircraft Limited , formed by John Edgley who , with a small team , designed and built the original prototype . In 1982 , institutional investors bought into the project and set up a production line at Old Sarum Airfield in Wiltshire . Over the next three years , the company was built up to full manufacturing capability , the aircraft received UK certification , and the first customer aircraft was delivered . Despite this success , the additional investment necessary for the final phase of full production was not forthcoming , the business went into receivership , and John Edgley was forced out . With new owners , aircraft on the production line were completed , and the Optica entered service .",
      "The aircraft has an unusual configuration with a fully glazed forward cabin , reminiscent of an Alouette helicopter , that provides 270\u00b0 panoramic vision and almost vertical downward vision for the pilot and two passengers . The aircraft has twin booms with twin rudders and a high-mounted tailplane . It is powered by a Lycoming flat-six normally-aspirated engine situated behind the cabin and driving a fixed pitch ducted fan . Due to the ducted fan , the aircraft is exceptionally quiet . The aircraft has a fixed tricycle undercarriage with the nosewheel offset to the left . The wings are unswept and untapered . The aircraft is of fairly standard all-metal construction , with stressed skin of aluminium .",
      "The aircrafts distinctive appearance has led to it being known as the bug-eye in some popular reports .",
      "Operational history .",
      "The Optica , powered by a 160 hp ( 119 kW ) Lycoming IO-320 engine , made its maiden flight on 14 December 1979 when it was flown by Squadron Leader Angus McVitie , the chief pilot of the Cranfield College of Aeronautics .",
      "The Optica , upgraded to the more powerful Lycoming IO-540 , entered production in 1983 . Edgley Aircraft Limited obtained its initial Civil Aviation Authority certification on 8 February 1985 .",
      "A total of 22 Opticas have been manufactured , and construction of a 23rd begun but not completed . Ten aircraft were destroyed in an arson attack at the factory .",
      "The Optica went through several changes of ownership , until FLS Aerospace ( Lovaux Ltd ) took over the rights , together with the design and manufacturing rights to the Sprint : a two-seat ab-initio trainer that had been designed by Sydney Holloway in Cornwall UK at about the same time as the Optica . Lovaux had intended to develop both aircraft , with the Sprint intended as the military trainer for the UK forces . However , the Sprint was not adopted for this role , and Lovaux cancelled both projects .",
      "The Optica and the Sprint together then passed through other owners until , in 2007 , they were offered to John Edgley who formed a new company , AeroElvira Limited , with three former employees of Edgley Aircraft ( Chris Burleigh , Fin Colson and Dave Lee ) who at that time were working on both projects for the then-owners . The new company successfully put G-BOPO back into service as a UK demonstrator , with a first return-to-service flight on 3 June 2008 . In August 2016 Interflight Global announced plans to start a valuation of the dormant Optica programme with a view to relaunching production . In December 2016 , InterFlight Global completed its valuation and in June 2017 , delivered an LOI to AeroElvira to continue with due diligence , appraisal and further steps to re launch the EA-7 Optica aircraft programme in the 2018\u201319 timeframe . IFG planned to develop , market and support the Optica , outsourcing the fabrication and final assembly to an FAA/EASA Part 23 certified OEM . At the end of 2018 , IFG modified its initial program re-launch efforts whilst , again , identifying and selecting a suitable OEM strategic partner to update the Optica TC and to bring the aircraft into production . As of the end of 2019 , IFG continues to seek for a strategic OEM partner to re-launch the program aligned with optionally piloted and powered by electric or hybrid electric powerplants .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "On 15 May 1985 , Optica G-KATY crashed , killing its Hampshire Constabulary pilot and his photographer passenger . The UK Department of Transport Air Accidents Investigation Branch found , inter alia , that : There was no indication that either structural or mechanical failure had occurred or of flying control malfunction or jamming . and that The final loss of control was caused by either the aircraft stalling in a turn at a high angle of bank , or the nose dropping or interference with the controls by the photographer alarmed by his apparent insecurity .",
      "On 11 March 1990 , G-BMPL , while in flight , sustained damage to the ducted fan and hub assembly and minor airframe damage . The pilot performed a successful forced approach landing : there were no injuries and no further damage to the aircraft . A subsequent investigation discovered cracks resulting from metal fatigue on the fan hub . The manufacturer issued a service bulletin calling for a hub inspection before further flight , and the UK Civil Aviation Authority issued a Mandatory Airworthiness Notice ( No . 004-05-90 ) . The Optica fan has now been replaced by one designed and manufactured by Hoffmann Propeller .",

      "Karls\u00f8y",
      "Karls\u00f8y ( ) is an island municipality in Troms og Finnmark county , Norway . The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Hansnes . Other villages include D\u00e5fjord , Hessfjord , Karls\u00f8ya , Torsv\u00e5g , Vannv\u00e5g , and Vannareid . The municipality is made up of many islands including Ringvass\u00f8ya , Rein\u00f8ya , Vann\u00f8ya , Karls\u00f8ya , and Rebbenes\u00f8ya plus several uninhabited islands ( many of which were formerly inhabited ) . Some of the currently uninhabited islands include Helg\u00f8ya , Nordkval\u00f8ya , Gr\u00f8t\u00f8ya , and Nord-Fugl\u00f8ya .",
      "The municipality is the 103rd largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway . Karls\u00f8y is the 270th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,200 . The municipalitys population density is and its population has decreased by 7.2% over the last decade .",
      "General information .",
      "Karls\u00f8y was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 ( see the formannskapsdistrikt law ) . On 1 January 1867 , the southern Ullsfjord district of Karls\u00f8y ( population : 862 ) was transferred from Karls\u00f8y to the neighboring Lyngen Municipality . On 1 September 1886 , the western island district ( population : 828 ) was separated from Karls\u00f8y to become the new municipality of Helg\u00f8y . This left Karls\u00f8y with 1,334 inhabitants .",
      "During the 1960s , there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee . On 1 January 1964 , the municipality of Helg\u00f8y was merged back into the municipality of Karls\u00f8y . At the same time , all of the mainland areas of Karls\u00f8y ( the northern part of the Lyngen peninsula , with 1,001 inhabitants ) was transferred from Karls\u00f8y to neighboring Lyngen Municipality . After all the changes , the new Karls\u00f8y had 3,414 residents . On 1 January 2008 , the southern part of the island of Rein\u00f8ya was transferred from Troms\u00f8 Municipality to Karls\u00f8y Municipality .",
      "On 1 January 2020 , the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county . Previously , it had been part of the old Troms county .",
      "Name .",
      "The municipality ( originally the parish ) is named after the small Karls\u00f8ya island ( Old Norse : Kals\u00f8e ) , since the first Karls\u00f8y Church was built there . The first element is the genitive case of the male name Karl and the last element is \u00f8y which means island . Prior to 1909 , the name was spelled Karls\u00f8 .",
      "Coat of arms .",
      "The coat of arms was granted on 12 December 1980 . The arms show the head of a white-tailed eagle on a blue background , since one of Europes largest colonies of these birds is found on the island of Nord-Fugl\u00f8ya in the municipality . Furthermore , the eagle symbolizes the importance of fishing for the municipality .",
      "Churches .",
      "The Church of Norway has one parish ( sokn ) within the municipality of Karls\u00f8y . It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti ( arch-deanery ) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland .",
      "Economy .",
      "Karls\u00f8y is among the worlds most important exporters of dried and salted cod , with Portugal , Spain , and Brazil among the main markets . The population is almost totally dependent on fishing . There are also goat herding businesses and some musicians that live on the island . There is also some tourism , including a festival that runs in the Summer . There are plans for 50 holiday homes to be built on the isle .",
      "Geography and nature .",
      "The municipality consists of islands only . Ringvass\u00f8ya , Norways sixth largest island , is the largest island in the municipality . Nordkval\u00f8ya , Helg\u00f8ya , Karls\u00f8ya , Vanna ( Vann\u00f8ya ) , Rein\u00f8ya , and Rebbenes\u00f8ya are the other major islands .",
      "The islands of Rebbenes\u00f8y and Ringvass\u00f8y are split ( as was Rein\u00f8ya before 2008 ) , with the southern part belonging to neighboring Troms\u00f8 municipality . The reason is that the borders were drawn when boat was the only means of transportation ; then it made sense that the southern parts of the islands belonged to Troms\u00f8 while the northern parts belonged to Karls\u00f8y . Today , when roads have replaced the boats , the situation is awkward , which is why the Norwegian government transferred all of Rein\u00f8y to the municipality of Karls\u00f8y on 1 January 2008 . Soltindan is the highest mountain on the island of Ringvass\u00f8y at above sea level .",
      "Karls\u00f8ya , the little island after which the municipality is named , has a village with the 19th century Karls\u00f8y Church . The inhabitants include the original inhabitants , hippies , and Norwegian Muslims .",
      "Helg\u00f8ya , the former seat of the independent municipality of Helg\u00f8y in the western part of present Karls\u00f8y , is today a more or less abandoned village of wooden houses and the old Helg\u00f8y Church . The island can only be reached when services are celebrated in the church , and ferry rides are organized .",
      "Lake Skogsfjordvatn , in the centre of Ringvass\u00f8y , is a lake with some fishing , surrounded by sub-Arctic forests . This is Norways largest lake in an island . The island of Vann\u00f8ya has several villages , including Bur\u00f8ysund and Torsv\u00e5g , the latter offering views of the Atlantic from the Torsv\u00e5g Lighthouse .",
      "Climate .",
      "Karls\u00f8y mostly has a subpolar oceanic climate . Torsv\u00e5g lighthouse has been recording temperature sine 1933 , and is situated on the nortwhestern tip of Vanna island . The eastern and inland part of the islands will have slightly warmer summers and slightly colder winters . The record low at Torsv\u00e5g is recorded January 1979 . The record high is from July 1966 .",
      "Government .",
      "All municipalities in Norway , including Karls\u00f8y , are responsible for primary education ( through 10th grade ) , outpatient health services , senior citizen services , unemployment and other social services , zoning , economic development , and municipal roads . The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives , which in turn elect a mayor . The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal .",
      "Municipal council .",
      "The municipal council of Karls\u00f8y is made up of 17 representatives that are elected to four year terms . The party breakdown of the council is as follows :",

      "Jarvis Island",
      "Jarvis Island ( ; formerly known as Bunker Island or Bunkers Shoal ) is an uninhabited coral island located in the South Pacific Ocean , about halfway between Hawaii and the Cook Islands . It is an unincorporated , unorganized territory of the United States , administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the Interior as part of the National Wildlife Refuge system . Unlike most coral atolls , the lagoon on Jarvis is wholly dry .",
      "Jarvis is one of the Line Islands and for statistical purposes is also grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands . Jarvis Island is the largest of three U.S . equatorial possessions , which include Baker Island and Howland Island .",
      "Geography and ecology .",
      "While a few offshore anchorage spots are marked on maps , Jarvis island has no ports or harbors , and swift currents are a hazard . There is a boat landing area in the middle of the western shoreline near a crumbling day beacon , and another near the southwest corner of the island . The center of Jarvis island is a dried lagoon where deep guano deposits accumulated , which were mined for about 20 years during the nineteenth century . The island has a tropical desert climate , with high daytime temperatures , constant wind , and strong sun . Nights , however , are quite cool . The ground is mostly sandy and reaches 23 feet ( 7 meters ) at its highest point . Because of the islands distance from other large landmasses , the Jarvis Island high point is the 36th most isolated peak in the world . The low-lying coral island has long been noted as hard to sight from small ships and is surrounded by a narrow fringing reef .",
      "Jarvis Island is one of two United States territories that are in the southern hemisphere ( the other is American Samoa ) . Located only south of the equator , Jarvis has no known natural freshwater lens and scant rainfall . This creates a very bleak , flat landscape without any plants larger than shrubs . There is no evidence that the island has ever supported a self-sustaining human population . Its sparse bunch grass , prostrate vines and low-growing shrubs are primarily a nesting , roosting , and foraging habitat for seabirds , shorebirds , and marine wildlife .",
      "Jarvis Island was submerged underwater during the latest interglacial period , roughly 125,000 years ago , when sea levels were 5\u201310 meters higher than today . As the sea level declined , the horseshoe-shaped lagoon was formed in the center of Jarvis Island .",
      "Topographic isolation .",
      "Jarvis Island High Point has a topographic isolation of 380.57 km / 236.47 mi with Joes Hill on Kiritimati being the nearest higher neighbour .",
      "Time zone .",
      "Jarvis Island is located in the Samoa Time Zone ( UTC -11:00 ) , the same time zone as American Samoa , Kingman Reef , Midway Atoll , and Palmyra Atoll .",
      "Birds .",
      "Jarvis Island once held some of the largest seabird breeding colonies in the tropical ocean , but guano mining and the introduction of rodents have ruined much of the islands native wildlife . Just eight breeding species were recorded in 1982 , compared to thirteen in 1996 , and fourteen species in 2004 . The Polynesian storm petrel had made its return after over 40 years absent from Jarvis Island , and the number of Brown noddies multiplied from just a few birds in 1982 to nearly 10,000 . Just twelve Gray-backed terns were recorded in 1982 , but by 2004 , over 200 nests were found on there . The island , with its surrounding marine waters , has been recognised as an Important Bird Area ( IBA ) by BirdLife International because it supports colonies of lesser frigatebirds , brown and masked boobies , red-tailed tropicbirds , Polynesian storm petrels , blue noddies and sooty terns , as well as serving as a migratory stopover for bristle-thighed curlews .",
      "History .",
      "Discovery .",
      "The islands first known sighting by Europeans was on August 21 , 1821 , by the British ship Eliza Francis ( or Eliza Frances ) owned by Edward , Thomas and William Jarvis and commanded by Captain Brown . The island was visited by whaling vessels till the 1870s .",
      "The U.S . Exploring Expedition surveyed the island in 1841 . In March 1857 the island was claimed for the United States under the Guano Islands Act and formally annexed on February 27 , 1858 .",
      "Nineteenth-century guano mining .",
      "The American Guano Company , which was incorporated in 1857 , established claims in respect of Baker Island and Jarvis Island which was recognized under the U.S . Guano Islands Act of 1856 . Beginning in 1858 , several support structures were built on Jarvis Island , along with a two-story , eight-room superintendents house featuring an observation cupola and wide verandahs . Tram tracks were laid down for bringing mined guano to the western shore . One of the first loads was taken by Samuel Gardner Wilder .",
      "For the following twenty-one years , Jarvis was commercially mined for guano , sent to the United States as fertilizer , but the island was abruptly abandoned in 1879 , leaving behind about a dozen buildings and 8,000 tonnes of mined guano .",
      "New Zealand entrepreneurs , including photographer Henry Winkelmann , then made unsuccessful attempts to continue guano extraction on Jarvis , and the two-storey house was sporadically inhabited during the early 1880s . Squire Flockton was left alone on the island as caretaker for several months and committed suicide there in 1883 , apparently from gin-fueled despair . His wooden grave marker was a carved plank which could be seen in the islands tiny four-grave cemetery for decades .",
      "John T . Arundel & Co . resumed mining guano from 1886 to 1899 . The United Kingdom annexed the island on June 3 , 1889 . Phosphate and copra entrepreneur John T . Arundel visited the island in 1909 on maiden voyage of the S.S . Ocean Queen and near the beach landing on the western shore members of the crew built a pyramidal day beacon made from slats of wood , which was painted white . The beacon was standing in 1935 , and remained until at least 1942 .",
      "Wreck of barquentine Amaranth .",
      "On August 30 , 1913 , the barquentine Amaranth ( C . W . Nielson , captain ) was carrying a cargo of coal from Newcastle , New South Wales , to San Francisco when it wrecked on Jarvis southern shore . Ruins of ten wooden guano-mining buildings , the two-story house among them , could still be seen by the Amaranth crew , who left Jarvis aboard two lifeboats . One reached Pago Pago , American Samoa , and the other made Apia in Western Samoa . The ships scattered remains were noted and scavenged for many years , and rounded fragments of coal from the Amaranths hold were still being found on the south beach in the late 1930s .",
      "Millersville ( 1935\u20131942 ) .",
      "Jarvis Island was reclaimed by the United States government and colonized from March 26 , 1935 , onwards , under the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project ( see also Howland Island and Baker Island ) . President Franklin D . Roosevelt assigned administration of the island to the U.S . Department of the Interior on May 13 , 1936 . Starting out as a cluster of large , open tents pitched next to the still-standing white wooden day beacon , the Millersville settlement on the islands western shore was named after a bureaucrat with the United States Department of Air Commerce . The settlement grew into a group of shacks built mostly with wreckage from the Amaranth ( lumber from which was also used by the young Hawaiian colonists to build surfboards ) , but later , stone and wood dwellings were built and equipped with refrigeration , radio equipment , and a weather station . A crude aircraft landing area was cleared on the northeast side of the island , and a T-shaped marker which was intended to be seen from the air was made from gathered stones , but no airplane is known to have ever landed there .",
      "At the beginning of World War II , an Imperial Japanese Navy submarine surfaced off the west coast of the island . Believing that it was a U.S . Navy submarine which had come to fetch them , the four young colonists rushed down the steep western beach in front of Millersville towards the shore . The submarine answered their waves with fire from its deck gun , but no one was hurt in the attack . On February 7 , 1942 , the USCGC Taney evacuated the colonists , then shelled and burned the dwellings . The roughly cleared landing area on the islands northeast end was later shelled by the Japanese , leaving crater holes .",
      "International Geophysical Year .",
      "Jarvis was visited by scientists during the International Geophysical Year from July 1957 until November 1958 . In January 1958 all scattered building ruins from both the nineteenth century guano diggings and the 1935\u20131942 colonization attempt were swept away without a trace by a severe storm which lasted several days and was witnessed by the scientists . When the IGY research project ended the island was abandoned again . By the early 1960s a few sheds , a century of accumulated trash , the scientists house from the late 1950s and a solid , short lighthouse-like day beacon built two decades before were the only signs of human habitation on Jarvis .",
      "National Wildlife Refuge .",
      "On June 27 , 1974 , Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton created Jarvis Island National Wildlife Refuge which was expanded in 2009 to add submerged lands within of the island . The refuge now includes of land and of water . Along with six other islands , the island was administered by the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex . In January 2009 , that entity was upgraded to the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument by President George W . Bush .",
      "A feral cat population , descendants of cats likely brought by colonists in the 1930s , wrought disruption to the islands wildlife and vegetation . These cats were removed through efforts which began in the mid-1960s and lasted until 1990 when they were completely eradicated . Since cats were removed , seabird numbers and diversity have increased .",
      "Nineteenth-century tram track remains can be seen in the dried lagoon bed at the islands center and the late 1930s-era lighthouse-shaped day beacon still stands on the western shore at the site of Millersville .",
      "Public entry to anyone , including U.S . citizens , on Jarvis Island requires a special-use permit and is generally restricted to scientists and educators . The U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service and the United States Coast Guard periodically visit Jarvis .",
      "Transportation .",
      "There is no airport on the island , nor does the island contain any large terminal or port . There is a day beacon near the middle of the west coast . Some offshore anchorage is available .",
      "Military .",
      "As a U.S . territory , the defense of Jarvis Island is the responsibility of the United States . All laws of the United States are applicable on the island ."

      "Before it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946 , Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg ( 1636\u20131692 ) , the Electorate of Hanover ( 1692\u20131814 ) , the Kingdom of Hanover ( 1814\u20131866 ) , the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia ( 1868\u20131918 ) , the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia ( 1918\u20131946 ) and of the State of Hanover ( 1946 ) . From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( later described as the Elector of Hanover ) .",
      "The city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways ( Autobahnen ) , connecting European main lines in both the east-west ( Berlin\u2013Ruhr area/D\u00fcsseldorf/Cologne ) and north-south ( Hamburg\u2013Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich ) directions . Hannover Airport lies north of the city , in Langenhagen , and is Germanys ninth-busiest airport . The citys most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School ( Medizinische Hochschule Hannover ) , one of Germanys leading medical schools , with its university hospital Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover , and the Leibniz University Hannover .",

      "Hanover is the traditional English spelling . The German spelling ( with a double n ) is becoming more popular in English ; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling , and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites . The English pronunciation , with stress on the first syllable , is applied to both the German and English spellings , which is different from German pronunciation , with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel . The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts , especially when referring to the British House of Hanover .",
      "History .",
      "Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine . Its original name Honovere may mean high ( river ) bank , though this is debated ( cf . das Hohe Ufer ) . Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century , receiving town privileges in 1241 , owing to its position at a natural crossroads . As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade . It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains , so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it . Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine , Ruhr and Saar river valleys , their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north , for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia .",
      "In the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built , as well as a city wall with three city gates . The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains , which increased the citys importance .",
      "In 1636 George , Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg , ruler of the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg principality of Calenberg , moved his residence to Hanover . The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708 . Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover , colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenbergs capital ( see also : House of Hanover ) . Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain ( and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ) . The first of these was George I Louis , who acceded to the British throne in 1714 . The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV . Semi-Salic law , which required succession by the male line if possible , forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover . As a male-line descendant of George I , Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover . Her descendants , however , bore her husbands titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha . Three kings of Great Britain , or the United Kingdom , were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover .",
      "During the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover ( 1714\u20131837 ) the monarchs rarely visited the city . In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers ( 1760\u20131837 ) there was only one short visit , by George IV in 1821 . From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover .",
      "During the Seven Years War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757 . The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation , leading to the citys occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover . It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year .",
      "19th century .",
      "After Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg ( Convention of the Elbe ) on July 5 , 1803 , about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover . The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover . However , George III did not recognise the Convention of the Elbe . This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain , where the Kings German Legion was formed . It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars . The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover . The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably .",
      "In 1837 , the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IVs heir in the United Kingdom was female ( Queen Victoria ) . Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs . Thus , Hanover passed to William IVs brother , Ernest Augustus , and remained a kingdom until 1866 , when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war . Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza , Prussia employed Moltke the Elders Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army . The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover . After the annexation , the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government .",
      "To Hanovers industry , however , the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business . The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit ( the founders era ) . Between 1879 and 1902 Hanovers population grew from 87,600 to 313,940 .",
      "In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated , and from 1893 an electric tram was installed . In 1887 Hanovers Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone .",
      "Nazi Germany .",
      "After 1937 the lord mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP ( Nazi party ) . A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover . In October 1938 , 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland , including the Grynszpan family . However , Poland refused to accept them , leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees , fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations . The Grynszpans son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time . When he learned of what was happening , he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath , who died shortly afterwards .",
      "The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht ( 9 November 1938 ) . On that day , the synagogue of Hanover , designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style , was burnt by the Nazis .",
      "In September 1941 , through the Action Lauterbacher plan , a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began . Even before the Wannsee Conference , on 15 December 1941 , the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga . A total of 2,400 people were deported , and very few survived . During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover , in which many Jews were confined . Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938 , fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war . Today , a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover .",
      "After the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover .",
      "World War II .",
      "As an important railway and road junction and production centre , Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II , including the Oil Campaign . Targets included the AFA ( St\u00f6cken ) , the Deurag-Nerag refinery ( Misburg ) , the Continental plants ( Vahrenwald and Limmer ) , the United light metal works ( VLW ) in Ricklingen and Laatzen ( today Hanover fairground ) , the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant , the Hanomag factory ( Linden ) and the tank factory M.N.H . Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen ( Badenstedt ) . Residential areas were also targeted , and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids . More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids . After the war , the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial .",
      "The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945 . The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945 .",
      "Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state ( Land ) of Lower Saxony in 1946 .",

      "Calcio Catania",
      "Calcio Catania , commonly referred to as Catania , is an Italian football club founded in 1929 and based in Catania , Sicily . They currently compete in Serie C , the third tier of the Italian football league system , and host home games at the Stadio Angelo Massimino .",
      "The club has achieved moderate success in the top league , with the highest position ever reached by the club is eighth in Serie A , done four times : during the early 1960s and again in 2012\u201313 . The furthest Catania have progressed in cup competitions is the final of the Coppa delle Alpi . The club is one of the most important in Southern Italy , and with around 600,000 fans it is the 12th most popular team in Italy .",
      "History .",
      "Origin .",
      "The origins of football being played by representatives of the Province of Catania can be traced back to English cargo ships , thanks to the workers who brought the game to Sicily . Specifically , the earliest Catania team can be traced to a match which took place on 2 May 1901 at San Raineri di Messina against Messina ; the team was named Royal Yacht Catania , an English ship with a local Catanian crew .",
      "The ship workers team was just a pastime , however , and Catanias first professional and most stable football club was founded on 19 June 1908 by Italian film director Gaetano Ventimiglia and Francesco Sturzo dAldobrando , who founded the club under the name A.S . Educazione Fisica Pro Patria . Early on , they would always play against sailors visiting the port of Catania , particularly from foreign ships . Though their first ever match was against the Italian battleship , the game ended in a 1\u20131 draw and the Catania line-up that day consisted of Vassallo , Gismondo , Bianchi , Messina , Slaiter , Caccamo , Stellario , Binning , Cocuzza , Ventimiglia and Pappalardo . Just two years later , they changed the name to Unione Sportiva Catanese .",
      "Foundation .",
      "In the north of Italy , football was more organised and those clubs competed in the early Italian Football Championships , while the southern clubs competed in competitions such as the Lipton , Sant Agata and Agordad cups . US Catanese survived World War I and just after played in the local Coppa Federale Siciliana . Seven seasons later , in 1927 , they were entered into the Campionato Catanese , which was won in the 1928\u201329 season . As they gained promotion , the team entered the Second Division , but the fascist reform of Italian football dictated the disbandment of Catanese and the establishment of Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Catania on 27 June 1929 . The new club first competed in Serie B in the 1934\u201335 season , where they finished fourth ; that year , Genoa won the Serie B title .",
      "Catania played in the league for three seasons during this period before ultimately being relegated . Down in Serie C , Catania were crowned champions in the 1938\u201339 season , finishing above Sicilian rivals Siracusa and Messina , who came in second- and third-place respectively . Their return to Serie B was not a pleasant one ; the club finished bottom of the league and won only three games that season . The clubs name was briefly changed to Associazione Calcio Fascista Catania during the 1942\u201343 season in Serie C , which ended prematurely due to World War II .",
      "Rebirth .",
      "After World War II ended , a local competition was organised , the Campionato Siciliano . US Catanese were back ; at the end of that season , a local team named Elefante Catania were merged into the club . The merged club kept the Catanese name and competed in Serie C during the 1945\u201346 season , but finished last . In the same league that season , a team called Virtus Catania were also present , finishing eighth .",
      "At the end of the season , Catanese and Virtus merged to form Club Calcio Catania , with the clubs first president as Santi Manganaro-Passanisi , who had previously been president of Catanese . They were entered into Serie C , where they spent three seasons . After an epic duel with Reggina for first place in the league , Catania prevailed with stars such as Goffi , Messora , Ardesi and Prevosti , thereby gaining promotion to Serie B for the 1948\u201349 season .",
      "Golden years .",
      "The late 1950s through 1960s are considered the golden years for the Catanian club , as they managed to achieve promotion to Serie A on two separate occasions during this time . Their first promotion from Serie B came when , during the 1953\u201354 season , they beat Cagliari and Lombardy side Pro Patria to be crowned champions of the division . Their first season in Serie A saw the club achieve a respectable 12th-place finish , but the club were forcibly relegated due to financial scandal ( as were Udinese ) .",
      "Under the management of Carmelo Di Bella , who had played for the club in the late 1930s , Catania gained promotion from Serie B in the 1959\u201360 season . The race for promotion in third spot went down to the last day of the season and was very tense . Catania had lost their final game 4\u20132 to Brescia and needed Parma to get a good result against Triestina for the Sicilian club to secure promotion . That is exactly what happened , and Catania had thus gained promotion once more .",
      "Catania returned into Serie A for the 1960\u201361 season to begin what would be a six-year stay in the league . Their return season was emphatic , as the newly promoted club finished in eighth above top Italian clubs such as Lazio and Napoli . This season produced several notable wins ; they beat Napoli and Bologna twice , Sampdoria 3\u20130 at home and most notably beat Milan 4\u20133 in Sicily . Additionally , on the final day of the season , they beat Internazionale 2\u20130 , with goals from Castellazzi and Calvanese . This rubbed the salt into the wounds of Inter , who lost the closely contested title that year to Juventus .",
      "Four years later , in 1965 , Catania would also finish eighth in the league , this time above Roma and Sicilian rivals Messina . Many of the clubs most notable stars played around this time , such as midfielders Alvaro Biagini and the Brazilian Chinesinho , along with wingers Carlo Facchin and Giancarlo Danova in the side . Catania more than held their own amongst the giants of Italian football , with wins against Juventus ( 2\u20130 ) , Fiorentina ( 2\u20130 ) and Lazio ( 1\u20130 ) .",
      "Mixed fortunes in the 1970s and 1980s .",
      "After Catanias relegation in 1966 , Carmelo Di Bella left and the club stayed in Serie B , later notably clashing with Palermo in the Sicilian derby before the Palermitan club was promoted . Catania followed in 1969\u201370 with a third-place finish , ensuring promotion . Their stay in Serie A this time , however , was very brief , and they were relegated after just one season . Their most impressive results that season was 3\u20131 win against Lazio and a draw at home against Milan . Catania lacked goalscorers at the time , as they only scored 18 goals altogether in 30 games .",
      "Worse was to come for the club , who in 1973\u201374 were relegated down to Serie C , but they were able to bounce straight back with a promotion into Serie B as champions . A similar situation occurred in 1976\u201377 , where they were relegated down to Serie C . This time , however , they were not able to bounce right back ; they finished second and then third before finally being crowned champions of what was now known as Serie C1 in 1979\u201380 .",
      "After three short seasons , Catania were promoted after finishing in third place , behind Milan and Lazio , into Serie A . They played the 1983\u201384 season in Italys top league , but it proved to be an especially dismal season , with only one win ( which came against Pisa ) and 12 points despite the presence of Claudio Ranieri and Brazilian imports Luvanor and Pedrinho .",
      "Decline and revival .",
      "The decline of Catania began most evidently after its last relegation to Serie B . The team was no longer able to reach the top division of Italian football , and instead continued to decline , remaining in Serie C1 for the latter part of the 1980s . The lowest point of the clubs history , however , was reached in 1993 , when the teams participation for the year was cancelled by the Italian Football Federation ( FIGC ) due to financial irregularities .",
      "After a long judicial battle , however , the magistrature declared the FIGCs decision as invalid , thus forcing it to include Catania back into the footballing fold for the year . Catania was thus included in the Sicilian Eccellenza ( the sixth tier of Italian football ) , but in the meantime another Sicilian football team , Atletico Leonzio from Lentini ( in the Province of Syracuse ) , had been relocated in the city and renamed Atletico Catania . Despite all of this , the real Catania was able to rise back to Serie C in a relatively small number of years , and even back to Serie B in 2002 .",
      "In 2003 , Catania was at the centre of a controversy that led to the enlargement of Serie B from 20 to 24 teams , known as Caso Catania . The club claimed that Siena fielded an ineligible player in a 1\u20131 tie , a result which saw Catania relegated , whereas the two extra points from a victory would have kept them safe . They were awarded a 2\u20130 victory before the result was reverted , then re-awarded again . In August , the FIGC decided to let Catania , along with Genoa and Salernitana , stay in Serie B ; the newly reborn Fiorentina were also added for the 2003\u201304 season . The ruling led to protests and boycotts by the other Serie B clubs that delayed the start of the season , until the interventation of the Italian government .",
      "The league was reduced to 22 teams for 2004\u201305 , while at the same time Serie A expanded from 18 to 20 teams . During the start of that season , Antonino Pulvirenti , chairman of the flight company Windjet and owner of Acireale , a Sicilian Serie C1 team , bought the club . Catanias new ownership let the team enjoy a revival , and in 2005\u201306 Catania ended in second position , earning promotion to Serie A .",
      "Return to Serie A .",
      "The 2006\u201307 season saw Catania in Serie A for its first appearance in 22 years . In their first year back , Catania began well , and though they recorded a couple of heavy defeats , their home form saw them peak as high as fourth after 20 games .",
      "Their return season changed drastically on 2 February 2007 , due to the 2007 Catania football violence incident . It happened during the Sicilian derby with Palermo , where policeman Filippo Raciti was killed during football-related violence caused by Catania ultras outside the Stadio Angelo Massimino . The event led FIGC Commissioner Luca Pancalli to cancel all football-related events in the country for a period of time , including league and national team matches . Catania chairman and owner Antonino Pulvirenti announced his willingness to leave the football world , stating it was not possible to go on producing football in Catania .",
      "After the Italian football league restarted , Catania continued on but dropped in form largely . In truth , their slump in form had started just before the derby incident and all together they failed to win for 12 games in a row before beating Udinese 1\u20130 in late April 2007 , where they eventually finished 13th .",
      "The following season , with manager Pasquale Marino leaving for Udinese and Silvio Baldini taking charge of the team , proved to be much harder . Poor results in the league table were however coupled with impressive performance in the Coppa Italia , where Catania reached a historical place in the semi-finals , then lost to Roma . Meanwhile , Baldini resigned from his post on 31 March 2008 , being replaced by Walter Zenga in a somewhat surprise appointment ( at least due to Zengas lack of expertise at the Serie A level ) . Despite this , Zenga managed to lead the rossazzurri off the relegation zone , saving his side from falling down to Serie B in a heated final week game , a 1\u20131 home tie to Roma , with an equaliser goal scored by Jorge Mart\u00ednez in the 85th minute . Zenga was successively confirmed in charge of the team for the upcoming 2008\u201309 season .",
      "On 5 June 2009 , Zenga left Catania to be the manager at arch-rival Palermo . He was replaced by Gianluca Atzori , a relative coaching neophyte with just one years experience at Lega Pro Prima Divisione team Ravenna . Atzori was noted for using an attacking 4\u20133\u20133 formation at Ravenna and was expected to continue a similar approach with the Elefanti .",
      "On 8 December 2009 , Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107 was appointed new head coach of Catania , taking over from Atzori . He signed a contract until June 2011 with the Elefanti . Arriving at the club that was dead last in the Serie A standings , Mihajlovi\u0107 debuted with a loss against Livorno . The following week , however , his team pulled off a stunning upset by beating heavily favoured Juventus away in Turin with a 2\u20131 scoreline . After Mihajlovi\u0107s departure to Fiorentina , Catania appointed Marco Giampaolo as new head coach for the 2010\u201311 season . In January 2011 , Catania decided to remove Giampaolo from his position due to poor results and replace him with former Argentine star Diego Simeone , who had no previous experience at Serie A level but managed to guide the Sicilians to safety before to part company by the end of the season , after only four months in charge of the team . As a replacement , Catania appointed 37-year-old Vincenzo Montella at his second managerial experience after having served as caretaker at Roma during the final part of the 2010\u201311 season .",

      "Nik Stauskas",
      "Nikolas Tomas Stauskas ( born October 7 , 1993 ) is a Canadian professional basketball player for the Raptors 905 of the NBA G League . A native of Mississauga , Ontario , Stauskas played two seasons of National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) competition for the Michigan Wolverines ending with the 2013\u201314 team before declaring for the NBA draft . Stauskas was drafted eighth overall in the 2014 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings , for which he began his NBA career . Towards the end of his rookie season , Stauskas was tagged with the nickname Sauce Castillo after a closed captioning error resulted in a social media meme . Stauskas , whose family is of Lithuanian heritage , is a member of the Canadian national basketball team .",
      "Stauskas divided his high school years between Loyola Catholic Secondary School , South Kent School and St . Marks School , leading the latter to back-to-back New England Preparatory School Athletic Council ( NEPSAC ) Class AA Championship Games . The team won the NEPSAC championship in Stauskass 2012 senior season , and he was the championship games Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) . He was also selected to the NEPSAC All-Class AA team .",
      "As a freshman for the 2012\u201313 Michigan Wolverines , he was named Sports Illustrated National Freshman of the Week once , Big Ten Conference Freshman of the Week three times and to the Wayman Tisdale Award , United States Basketball Writers Association National Freshman of the Year , top 12 midseason list . During the 2013 NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Tournament , he earned South All-Regional Team recognition . As a sophomore for the 2013\u201314 team , Stauskas went on to be named a 2014 NCAA Mens Basketball consensus All-American and was named Big Ten Conference Mens Basketball Player of the Year for the 2013\u201314 Big Ten Conference mens basketball season .",
      "Early life .",
      "Stauskas gravitated toward basketball during his childhood . Stauskas has never played ice hockey and has barely played street hockey . He tried soccer at age six , but a broken arm put an end to that . His first experience with basketball came as a member of the Au\u0161ra Sports Club , which is a Toronto-based traveling team for children of Lithuanian descent . Stauskas grew up a Raptors fan with Vince Carter as his favorite player . At age eight or nine , he played Carter one-on-one at a Raptors open practice for fans held at Air Canada Centre , which boosted his enthusiasm for the sport . Ever since then shooting a basketball has been his favorite form of recreation . He became so devoted to basketball that his head coach at Michigan , John Beilein , said in 2013,He doesnt know anything about hockey , he doesnt know anything about football . The other day we had him try to throw a baseball pass as a press breaker . And he had never thrown a baseball . In fifth grade , his parents gave him and his brother a choice on how to landscape their backyard : a swimming pool , a putting green or a basketball court , leading to the family backyard court . He and his older brother Peter would play at all hours and all conditions , including a 2006 ice storm that was so severe that , as he recalled in 2013 , The ball couldnt hit the backboard without slipping off , but we didnt care .",
      "High school career .",
      "His brother claims that Stauskas scored about 50 points a game in middle school . For much of his youth , he and future Gonzaga point guard Kevin Pangos attended basketball camps together , regularly playing one-on-one while other campers took breaks from basketball for other activities . Until 2009 , Stauskas played for Loyola Catholic Secondary School . He averaged 15 points , 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 2007\u201308 and 32 points , 14 rebounds and 7.5 assists in 2008\u201309 . Its basketball team nearly disbanded before Stauskass grade 10 season in 2008\u201309 , when Loyola was in danger of not fielding a team because school policy required the presence of a teacher . Although his father , a computer consultant , was willing to volunteer as a coach , no teacher was willing to serve . Stauskass father finally found a French teacher who sat in the gym and graded papers while his father coached . In the meantime , Stauskas joined the premier Amateur Athletic Union ( AAU ) team in Toronto , run by Ro Russell . Some of Russells prior players , such as Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph had gone to the United States to complete their scholastic years . Stauskas , not wishing to risk not having a team to play on after the crisis of 2008\u20132009 , spent the 2009\u201310 academic year at South Kent School , but the forested rural campus made him homesick and he transferred to St . Marks School the following year . He missed the 2009\u201310 basketball season as a result of a hip injury . Michigan Wolverines mens basketball head coach John Beilein became familiar with Stauskas during the Summer 2010 NBA camp prior to Stauskass junior year . He visited Michigan that summer and was also being recruited by Villanova , Iowa State , Georgetown , Notre Dame , Florida and Providence . By the time he arrived at St . Marks , he was expected to be an All-State performer . In the 2011 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game , Stauskas led St . Marks in scoring with 17 points against Nerlens Noel and the Tilton School , but St . Marks lost 72\u201356 . On March 26 , 2011 , Stauskas made a verbal commitment to Michigan . This commitment made him the second member of Michigans recruiting class of 2012 . That summer he scored 27 points in an exhibition of Canadian high school all-stars against the Baylor Bears mens basketball team .",
      "Prior to his senior year , ESPN named him as one of the top 25 three-point shooters in the national class of 2012 . At the time of their November 2011 National Letter of Intent signings , Stauskas , Glenn Robinson III and Mitch McGary gave Michigan a consensus top 10 entering class for its 2012 class . Stauskas visited Michigan along with future teammate Robinson to see the 61\u201356 New Years Day 2012 victory by the 2011\u201312 Wolverines team over Minnesota . Then Stauskas led St . Marks to 67\u201357 victory in a 2012 Hoophall Classic contest with 16 points against Friends Central . As the season progressed , Stauskas ( and Robinson ) improved in the national player ratings to offset McGarys slide and maintain a top-rated class . He scored 19 to lead his school to a 59\u201353 2012 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game victory over Noels Tilton . Stauskas earned the NEPSAC championship game MVP . He was selected to the 2012 All-NEPSAC Class AA first team ( along with teammate Kaleb Tarczewski ) . Following these honors , Stauskass stock and rankings continued to rise .",
      "College career .",
      "The 2011\u201312 Michigan Wolverines mens basketball team had been co-champions of 2011\u201312 Big Ten Conference , but lost both of its co-captains , Zack Novak and Stu Douglass , to graduation and three players as transfers . The team was returning a nucleus of All-Big Ten players Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway Jr .",
      "Freshman .",
      "Stauskas began his college career with the expectation that he would be a sharpshooter based on his performance in three-point field goal drills in which he had raised the bar for the team . In the championship rounds of the 2012 NIT Season Tip-Off tournament at Madison Square Garden on November 21 and 23 , Michigan defeated Pittsburgh and Kansas State , respectively , to win the tournament . On November 26 , Stauskas earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week honors for his NIT tournament performance in which he averaged 12.5 points and 4.5 rebounds . On November 27 , Michigan defeated its first ranked opponent of the season , NC State ( #18 AP Poll/#18 Coaches Poll ) , in the ACC\u2013Big Ten Challenge with a then-career-high 20 points from Stauskas in a 79\u201372 victory . After that game , ESPN analyst Dan Dakich described Stauskas as the most underrated freshman in the country . That week , Burke called Stauskas the best shooter he has ever played with . On December 1 against Bradley , Stauskas made his first career regular season start and posted a new career-high 22 points . For his first two 20 point performances , he repeated as Big Ten Freshman of the Week on December 3 . Stauskas also earned recognition from Sports Illustrated Seth Davis as National Freshman of the Week on December 3 . On December 29 , against Central Michigan , Stauskas posted 19 points on 5-for-8 three-point shooting . His 5 three-pointers and 7 rebounds were career-highs , earning him his third Big Ten Freshman of the Week on December 31 .",
      "Entering the day of December 31 , Stauskas led the nation in three-point field goal percentage . This is somewhat confusing because various sources have various eligibility thresholds . ESPN reports leaders based on a 2 three-point attempts per game minimum , while BigTen.org only requires a minimum of 1.5 attempts per game for eligibility . NCAA.org requires a minimum of 2.5 made per game , and Stauskas had been the leader since the December 9 weekly report . On January 16 , Sporting News named Stauskas the surprise player of the first half of the year . As late as January 28 Stauskas was leading the Big Ten in free throw shooting percentage ( .833 ) as well as three-pointers made and was second in 3-point shooting percentage ( .490 ) . On that day , Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes . It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the Fab Five 1992\u201393 team did so on December 5 , 1992 . On January 31 , Stauskas and Robinson were named to the Wayman Tisdale Award ( USBWA National Freshman of the Year ) top 12 midseason list , recognizing their performances as being among the 12 best freshman performances in the NCAA competition . Stauskas finished the 18-game 2012\u201313 Big Ten Conference mens basketball season schedule with a 37% three-point percentage on 30-for-81 shooting during conference play .",
      "Prior to the 2013 NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Tournament , Jeff Goodman of CBSSports.com named Michigan with Stauskas first among tournament teams in terms of having the most future NBA talent on its roster ( in the absence of Kentucky who was relegated to the 2013 National Invitation Tournament ) . Having made his last 20 consecutive free throws entering the 2013 NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Tournament Sweet Sixteen , Stauskas ended the season with an 85.1% ( 74\u201387 ) free throw shooting percentage , which was better than the Big Ten Conference free throw shooting percentage leader , Adreian Payne ( 84.8% ) . In the regional finals on March 31 against Florida , Stauskas made all 6 of his three-point shot attempts , including all 5 in the first half as the team built a 41\u201317 lead before going into the half up 47\u201330 . Michigan advanced to the April 8 national championship game where the team lost to Louisville by an 82\u201376 margin . His 6 three-point shots was a new career best and his 22-point performance tied his career high . All his three-point shots came from the left corner . The 6 three-point shots pushed Stauskas to a Michigan freshman-season record total of 79 , surpassing Tim Hardaway Jr.s two-year-old record of 76 . Stauskas joined McGary and Most Outstanding Player Trey Burke on the South All-Regional team . For the season , his .9 fouls per 40 minutes was second in the country .",
      "Sophomore .",
      "In the offseason , Stauskas added to his frame and to his vertical jump . Lindys Sports selected Stauskas to the preseason All-Big Ten second team , naming Stauskas as the nations number 10 shooting guard and Big Tens best shooter . On November 12 , Stauskas posted career highs of 23 points and 5 assists in the second game of the regular season against South Carolina State . In the first half of the game , Stauskas made all six of his field goals , including 5 three-pointers . In the next game , Stauskas contributed a career-high 6 assists as well as 20 points against Iowa State on November 17 . Stauskas scored a game-high 24 points on November 21 against Long Beach State in the first round of the Puerto Rico Tip-Off , surpassing his career high set two games before and giving him three consecutive 20-point performances for the first time in his career . Stauskas established another career high the next day against Florida State as he scored 26 points including 7 of the teams 13 points in overtime , despite scoring only 3 points in the first half . In the game , he set a career high with 9 made free throws and logged his fourth consecutive 20 point game . Following a Michigan timeout with 11 seconds in regulation , Stauskas made a layup to force overtime . In the championship game against Charlotte , Stauskas tallied 20 points and a career-high 3 steals . Although Michigan lost in the championship game , Stauskas earned tournament MVP honors . In the second half Stauskas twisted his ankle , but continued to play the final 9\u00bd minutes . Stauskas sat out the November 29 game against to rest his ankle .",
      "In the January 2 Big Ten Conference opener against Minnesota , Stauskas set a career high with 7 assists while scoring 14 points . On January 14 , he had a game-high 21 points , team-high 5 assists as well as 6 rebounds against Penn State . On January 18 , Stauskas scored 23 points including the final 11 for Michigan as the team defeated ( #3 ) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center for the first time since the 1998\u201399 team did so , ending an 11-game losing streak at Wisconsin . Stauskas made all 6 of his free throw attempts in the final 25 seconds . The game marked the highest ranked team Michigan has ever beaten on the road . On January 21 , Stauskas earned his first Big Ten Conference Player of the Week recognition . At the time he was leading the conference in scoring and 20-point games . On January 22 , against ( #10 ) Iowa Stauskas tied his career high with 26 points and contributed 5 rebounds and 5 assists , helping Michigan defeated consecutive top 10 opponents for the first time since the 1996\u201397 team . On January 25 in the Michigan\u2013Michigan rivalry game against the 2013\u201314 Spartans , Stauskas contributed 19 points and 4 assists , including a 5-for-6 effort on three-point shots . The 80\u201375 victory over ( #3 ) Michigan State marked the first time in school history that the team defeated three consecutive AP Poll top ten opponents and marked the first time since the 1986\u201387 Iowa Hawkeyes that any team has won three consecutive games all of which were against top 10 opponents . It also gave Michigan a 7\u20130 Big Ten start , which is the best since the 1976\u201377 team won its first eight games . His effort for the week earned a second Big Ten Player of the Week recognition as well as a CBS Sports National Player of the Week honor on January 27 . Stauskas also earned Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week recognition from United States Basketball Writers Association on January 28 . He led the conference in scoring and three-point shooting percentage through January , but he only scored six points when Michigan got upset by Indiana on February 2 , ending a 10-game winning streak and 8\u20130 Big Ten conference start . Stuaskas established another career high in assists with 8 against Nebraska on February 5 as the team posted its largest conference game margin of victory since defeating Indiana 112-64 on February 22 , 1998 . On February 23 against ( #13/14 ) Michigan State , Michigan rebounded from an early 22\u201311 deficit to win 79\u201370 .

Upon being named Sporting News All-American , Stauskas was described as having made the biggest refinements to his game of his fellow honorees by Mike DeCourcy : Every player on this list , save for the freshmen , made incremental improvements from season to season in order to wind up as an All-American . More than anyone else , Stauskas redefined his game . As a freshman , he primarily was a catch-and-shoot weapon for the Wolverines in their charge to the 2013 NCAA championship game . He became a ballhandler in his second season , attacking defenders with his newly unleashed ability to dribble the ball and penetrate the lane . Stauskas earned third team All-American recognition from USA Today . He was a first team All-American selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches ( NABC ) . He was also a second team selection by Sports Illustrated and Bleacher Report , as well as a third team selection by NBC Sports .

ESPNs Chantel Jennings tweeted a picture of such a flag at Crisler Arena on December 4 , 2012 . One of her followers noted that the big version on the wall was a general fan flag and that a little version of the flag was added next to it for each three-pointer he made in the game . By mid-December of his freshman season , the students in the Maize Rage ( Michigan Wolverines mens basketball student section at Crisler Arena ) had begun cheering Stauskas on with such a flag . The Michigan Public & Media Relations office started mentioning the flag before Christmas . The flag was mentioned widely in the press as he continued his hot shooting into January .",
      "Professional career .",
      "2014 NBA draft .",
      "Discussion about him entering the 2014 NBA draft began when he got hot in January 2014 and his father told Sports Illustrated , He knows all he has to do is keep his nose to the grindstone for another couple of months , and there\u2019s a really good possibility he might be able to go Pro . However , a few days later , Stauskas attempted to distance himself from his fathers statements and apologized to his fans . Following the season , Stauskas , who was regarded as a likely late first round selection , said he would need some time to process his decision and that he would make his decision after talking to his coaches and family . On April 6 , Stauskas said he would make his decision within the next week or so . On April 7 , David Aldridge rated Stauskas as the number one potential draft entrant among shooting guards ( ahead of Harris , James Young , and Andrew Harrison ) and a late lottery selection . Others agree that Stauskas is a likely late lottery selection . Stauskas and teammates McGary and Robinson all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14 , giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose . On April 10 , reports emerged that Stauskas had decided to go pro , but he denied he had made a decision . The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein as his agent . Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein , and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway Jr . On April 15 , in a joint press conference with Robinson on the Big Ten Network , Stauskas declared for the 2014 NBA draft . During his two years with Michigan , the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins . Of Michigans prior 14 early NBA draft entrants , 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second . Stauskas did sign with Bartelstein ( along with teammate McGary ) . On May 5 , Stauskas threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park .",
      "At the May NBA Draft Combine , Stauskas opted to sit out of the shooting drills , but did elect to participate in official anthropometric measurements , strength/agility drills and team meetings . Stauskas participated in strength and agility testing along with 13 shooting guards , finishing fifth in running vertical jump , sixth in standing vertical leap , seventh in the shuttle run , ninth in the three-quarter court sprint and 11th in the lane agility drill . Stauskas was drafted 8th overall by the Sacramento Kings . He is the highest Michigan selection since Jamal Crawford went 8th in the 2000 NBA draft . With teammates McGary and Robinson also being drafted , it marked the first time Michigan had at least three draft picks since the 1990 NBA draft . With Burke and Hardaway having been drafted the year before , every player that started in the 2013 NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Championship Game was drafted either in the 2013 or 2014 NBA draft .",
      "Stauskas committed to represent the Sacramento Kings in 2014 NBA Summer League . Although Stauskas was expected to be an NBA shooting guard , he would be vying with 2013 NBA draft eighth overall selection Ben McLemore for playing time . Since the two may be on the court at the same time , Stauskas was expected to play some point guard in the Summer League as preparation for regular season possibilities . He posted a video of his preparation for the 2014 NBA Summer League .",
      "Sacramento Kings ( 2014\u20132015 ) .",
      "On July 8 , 2014 , Stauskas signed a rookie scale contract with the Sacramento Kings . During the 2014 NBA Summer League Stauskas was a starting member of the Summer League Champions . In the 2014\u201315 NBA.com Rookie Survey at the annual Rookie Photo Shoot on August 6 , Stauskas was named by his peers as the second best shooter in the Rookie class behind Doug McDermott . During his rookie pre-season , he got a lot of publicity for the statement I understand that I\u2019m a rookie and I\u2019m white , so people are going to attack me because of stereotypes about race and his unproven and presumably weak defensive skills . Stauskas was surprised by the attention the statement received . In his first week in the league , he had a 3-block game against the Los Angeles Clippers . On December 8 in his first game against Utah and former teammate and fellow Big Ten Player of the Year Burke , Stauskas posted career highs of 15 points and 8 rebounds . Stauskas again posted 15 points against the New York Knicks and former Michigan teammate Tim Hardaway Jr . on March 3 . On March 24 , he received the nickname Sauce Castillo via social media after a closed captioning error . Stauskas started in the Kings April 15 season finale against the Los Angeles Lakers and tallied 5 assists . It was his first and only start of the season .",

      "On July 10 , 2015 , Stauskas was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers along with Carl Landry , Jason Thompson , a future first round pick , and the rights to swap first round picks in 2016 and 2017 , in exchange for the rights to Art\u016bras Gudaitis and Luka Mitrovi\u0107 . During the preseason , Stauskas was impaired by a right tibia stress reaction . Although he felt recovered from the stress reaction by the beginning of the season , he missed the October 28 season opener with back spasms . The 2015\u201316 76ers team played no players over the age of 24 or with more than 3 years of NBA experience on opening night . Stauskas joined the young teams rotation in October 30 against the Utah Jazz with a 12-point debut performance . Stauskas moved into the starting lineup on November 2 against the Cleveland Cavaliers . He posted a career-high tying 15 points against his idol LeBron James . On November 7 , Stauskas posted a career-high 18 points and career-high tying five assists against the Orlando Magic . He tallied at least 12 points in each of his first five games of action for Philadelphia .",
      "However , by mid November , Stauskas was deep in a shooting slump . He was scoreless in back-to-back starts , going 0-for-10 ( 0\u20135 3-point shots ) combined against the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks on November 14 and 16 . Fortunately for Stauskas , his backup , Isaiah Canaan , was in a simultaneous slump , going 3-for-20 in the same games . However , Stauskas had a left knee contusion on November 23 against the Minnesota Timberwolves and was sidelined for the second half and the subsequent three-game road trip . He missed only one game and returned to the lineup on November 27 in limited minutes off the bench . On December 1 , Stauskas and the 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 103\u201391 . The win ended the longest losing streak in the history of major professional sports in the United States ( 28 games going back to the prior season ) and the worst start in NBA history ( tied with the 2009\u201310 New Jersey Nets at 0\u201318 ) . Stauskas went scoreless in 4 consecutive appearances between December 16 and 22 . He then did not play on December 23 when the 76ers played against the Milwaukee Bucks . When the 76ers defeated the Phoenix Suns in new point guard Ish Smiths first game with the team for their second win of the season ( snapping a 12-game losing streak and a 23-game road losing streak ) on December 26 , Stauskas was coming off the bench and contributed 17 points . As Stauskas endured an up and down season , he became Kendall Marshalls fathers target of blame for Marshalls lack of playing time on January 2 . That night against the Los Angeles Clippers , Stauskas posted 18 points on 6\u20138 three-point shooting . Stauskas returned to the starting lineup for the 76ers on January 4 against the Timberwolves for the 76ers 4th win of the season . However , he was injured in overtime of the January 15 contest against the Chicago Bulls and missed three games before returning to the lineup on January 25 against the Boston Celtics . Stauskas scored 18 points again on March 15 against the Brooklyn Nets . Stauskas established a new career high on March 18 against the Oklahoma City Thunder , scoring 23 points .",
      "After the first week of the 2016\u201317 NBA season , the 76ers exercised the fourth-year team option . On November 19 , 2016 , Stauskas scored 21 points , while shooting 8-for-9 in a 120\u2013105 win over the Phoenix Suns . He posted a career-high 24 points on 4-for-7 three-point shooting on March 4 in a 136\u2013106 loss to Detroit . On March 20 against Orlando and March 22 against Oklahoma City , Stauskas reached 20 points in consecutive contests for the first time in his NBA career .",
      "Brooklyn Nets ( 2017\u20132018 ) .",
      "On December 7 , 2017 , Stauskas was traded , along with Jahlil Okafor and a 2019 second round draft pick , to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Trevor Booker . In his debut for the Nets on December 15 , 2017 , Stauskas scored a team-high 22 points in a 120\u201387 loss to the Toronto Raptors . In his first few weeks with Brooklyn , he made 19 of his first 33 shots ( 57.6% ) from beyond the three-point line and set a career high with 7 made three-point shots ( on 7-for-10 shooting ) on December 27 against the New Orleans Pelicans , which tied a Nets franchise record by a performance off the bench .",
      "Portland Trail Blazers ( 2018\u20132019 ) .",
      "On July 5 , 2018 , Stauskas signed with the Portland Trail Blazers . In his debut for the Trail Blazers in their season opener on October 18 , 2018 , Stauskas came off the bench to score a career high-tying 24 points in a 128\u2013119 win over the Los Angeles Lakers .",
      "Cleveland Cavaliers ( 2019 ) .",
      "On February 4 , 2019 , Stauskas was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers along with Wade Baldwin IV and two second-round picks for Rodney Hood . Three days later , he was acquired by the Houston Rockets in a three-team trade that involved the Cavaliers and Sacramento Kings . Hours later , he was traded again , this time to the Indiana Pacers alongside Baldwin , a 2021 second-round draft pick and the rights to Maarty Leunen , in exchange for cash considerations . He was waived by the Pacers on February 8 . On February 11 , Stauskas signed with the Cavaliers .",
      "Baskonia ( 2019\u20132020 ) .",
      "On August 1 , 2019 , Stauskas signed a one-year deal with Spanish EuroLeague club Kirolbet Baskonia . On February 12 , 2020 , Baskonia and Stauskas agreed to terminate the contract .",
      "On December 3 , 2020 , Stauskas was signed to a training camp contract by the Milwaukee Bucks . He was waived at the end of training camp .",
      "Raptors 905 ( 2021\u2013present ) .",
      "On January 27 , 2021 , Stauskas was included on the Raptors 905 roster for the 2020\u201321 season .",
      "National team career .",
      "Stauskas played for Canada in the 2009 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship held in Argentina . He helped lead the Canadian junior national team to a bronze medal , which qualified them for the 2010 FIBA Under-17 World Championship . He averaged 9.4 points per game in the tournament , including a game-high 21 points in a 126\u201378 loss against the United States team led by Bradley Beal and James Michael McAdoo on June 20 , 2009 . First overall 2013 NBA draft pick Anthony Bennett was one of Stauskas teammates in the tournament . Stauskas was later invited to train with the Canadian senior national team .",
      "He represented Canada at the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship , contributing 111 points in 9 games\u2014including 18-for-36 three-point shooting , but did not play in the teams final game . Food poisoning had impaired him in the semifinal loss against Venezuela , and the illness caused him to miss the bronze medal game against Mexico , which Canada won 87\u201386 .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Stauskas is the son of Paul and Ruta Stauskas . His brothers name is Peter . Three of Stauskass four grandparents lived in Lithuania before World War II . Stauskas previously attended Lithuanian Saturday School in Toronto and is able to understand and speak some Lithuanian . Geographically , Michigan is closer to Stauskass parents home in Ontario than any other major Division I school , according to Stauskas .",
      "When he tweeted a Christmas Eve 2012 video of himself making 45 of 50 three-point shots , Dick Vitale replied 14 minutes later . On April 24 , 2013 , he posted a video of himself making 70 of 76 three-pointers in five minutes , and 8 hours later , Stephen Curry challenged him , via Twitter , to a three-point shooting contest . Curry had set the National Basketball Association single-season three-pointers made record one week earlier . The following morning ESPN retweeted the video and noted that Stauskas made 46 in a row . A few hours later , when Stauskas woke up , he said he would look forward to such a contest . Soon Stauskas and Currys representatives arranged to have a showdown televised on TSN , but the contest would have been in violation of NCAA rules against competition between amateur athletes and professional athletes ."

      "The Dowager ( or Imperial Pelican ) Faberg\u00e9 egg , is a jewelled Easter egg made under the supervision of the Russian jeweller Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 in 1898 . The egg was made for Nicholas II of Russia , who presented it to his mother , the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna on Easter 1898 .",
      "Design .",
      "The egg was created by Faberges workmaster , Mikhail Evlampievich Perkhin ( Russian , 1860-1903 ) with miniatures by Johannes Zehngraf ( Danish , 1857-1908 ) and is made of red gold , diamonds , pearls , gray , pink and opalescent blue enamel and watercolor on ivory . The stand is made of varicolored gold and the egg itself unfolds into a screen of eight ivory miniatures .",
      "The egg is one of the few Faberge eggs that is not enameled over most of its surface . It is made of engraved red gold in the Empire style , surmounted by a pelican in opalescent gray , blue and pink enamel . The pelican is feeding her young in the nest , a symbol of maternal care . The egg is engraved with classical motifs , the commemorative dates 1797\u20131897 , and the inscription Visit our vineyards , O Lord , and we shall dwell in thee .",
      "The egg is supported on a varicolored gold , four-legged stand and retains its original red velvet case , the only time this color was used for a Tsar Imperial Easter Egg-case .",
      "Surprise .",
      "The egg contains eight oval miniature paintings of charitable institutions patronized by the Dowager Empress : the Xenia Institute , the Nikolai Orphanage , the Patriotic Institute , the Smolny Institute , the Ekaterina Institute , the Pavel Institute , the St . Petersburg Orphanage of Nikolai , and the Elizabeth Institute . The institutions , founded mainly for the education of the daughters of the nobility , are depicted on an extending folding screen of eight ivory panels , each within a pearl border . The miniatures are painted by court miniaturist Johannes Zehngraf . On the back of each is written the name of the institution portrayed . The ninth panel is a stand for the other eight .",
      "History .",
      "Because of the dates 1797 and 1897 on the Egg , for many years the Pelican Egg was ascribed to 1897 , but when the original Faberg\u00e9 invoice was found it showed that this Egg was presented to Maria Feodorovna for Easter 1898 .",
      "In 1930 , the Imperial Pelican Faberg\u00e9 egg , with the eight oval miniatures , was one of ten Imperial eggs sold by the Antikvariat to Armand Hammer in New York City . Hammer showed the egg along with other Russian treasures at department stores all across the United States . Between 1936 and 1938 it was purchased by Lillian Thomas Pratt , the wife of John Lee Pratt , from Hammer Galleries . Mrs . Pratt willed the Egg to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond , Virginia , upon her death in 1947 . It remains on view as part of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts European Decorative Art collection .",

The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the north , the core economic hubs of the country .",

Following European explorers in the eighteenth century , the British colonised the region into the British protectorates of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia towards the end of the nineteenth century . These were merged in 1911 to form Northern Rhodesia . For most of the colonial period , Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the British South Africa Company .",

Kaundas socialist United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) maintained power from 1964 until 1991 . Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy , cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Southern Rhodesia ( Zimbabwe ) , Angola , and Namibia . From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a one-party state with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto One Zambia , One Nation . Kaunda was succeeded by Frederick Chiluba of the social-democratic Movement for Multi-Party Democracy in 1991 , beginning a period of social-economic growth and government decentralisation . Zambia has since become a multi-party state and has experienced several peaceful transitions of power .",

      "The fossil skull remains of Broken Hill Man ( also known as Kabwe Man ) , dated between 300,000 and 125,000 years BC , further shows that the area was inhabited by early humans . Broken Hill Man was discovered in Zambia to be specific in Kabwe District .",
      "Khoisan and Batwa .",
      "The area of modern Zambia is known to have been inhabited by the Khoisan and Batwa peoples until around AD 300 , when migrating Bantu began to settle around these areas . It is believed the Khoisan people groups originated in East Africa and spread southwards around 150,000 years ago . The Twa people were split into two groups . One , the Kafwe Twa , lived around the Kafue Flats while the other , the Lukanga Twa , lived around the Lukanga Swamp . Many examples of ancient rock art in Zambia , like those of the Mwela Rock Paintings , Mumbwa Caves , and Nachikufu Cave , are attributed to these early hunter-gatherer groups . The Khoisan and especially the Twa formed a patron-client relationship with farming Bantu peoples across central and southern Africa but were eventually either displaced by or absorbed into the Bantu groups .",
      "The Bantu ( Abantu ) .",
      "The Bantu people or Abantu ( meaning people ) are an enormous and diverse ethnolinguistic group that comprise the majority of people in much of East , Southern and Central Africa . Due to Zambias location at the crossroads of Central Africa , Southern Africa , and the African Great Lakes , the history of the people that constitute modern Zambians is a history of these three regions .",
      "Many of the historical events in these three regions happened simultaneously , and thus Zambias history , like many African nations , cannot be presented perfectly chronologically . The early history of the peoples of modern Zambia is deduced from oral records , archaeology , and written records , mostly from non-Africans .",
      "Bantu origins .",
      "The Bantu people originally lived in West and Central Africa around what is today Cameroon and Nigeria . Around 4000 to 3000 years ago they began a millennia-long expansion into much of the continent . This event has been called the Bantu expansion ; it was one of the largest human migrations in history . The Bantu are believed to have been the first to have brought iron working technology into large parts of Africa . The Bantu Expansion happened primarily through two routes : a western one via the Congo Basin and an eastern one via the African Great Lakes .",
      "First Bantu settlement .",
      "The first Bantu people to arrive in Zambia came through the eastern route via the African Great Lakes . They arrived around the first millennium C.E , and among them were the Tonga people ( also called Ba-Tonga , Ba- meaning men ) and the Ba-Ila and Namwanga and other related groups who settled around Southern Zambia near Zimbabwe . Ba-Tonga oral records indicate that they came from the east near the big sea .",
      "They were later joined by the Ba-Tumbuka who settled around Eastern Zambia and Malawi .",
      "These first Bantu people lived in large villages . They lacked an organised unit under a chief or headman and worked as a community and help each other in times of field preparation for their crops . Villages moved around frequently as the soil became exhausted as a result of the slash-and-burn technique of planting crops . The people also keep large herds of cattle , which formed an important part of their societies .",
      "The first Bantu communities in Zambia were highly self-sufficient . Early European missionaries who settled in Southern Zambia noted the independence of these Bantu societies . One of these missionaries noted :",
      "[ If ] weapons for war , hunting , and domestic purposes are needed , the [ Tonga ] man goes to the hills and digs until he finds the iron ore . He smelts it and with the iron thus obtained makes axes , hoes , and other useful implements . He burns wood and makes charcoal for his forge . His bellows are made from the skins of animals and the pipes are clay tile , and the anvil and hammers are also pieces of the iron he has obtained . He moulds , welds , shapes , and performs all the work of the ordinary blacksmith .",
      "These early Bantu settlers also participated in the trade at the site Ingombe Ilede ( which translate sleeping cow in Chi-Tonga because the fallen baobab tree appears to resembles a cow ) in Southern Zambia . At this trading site they met numerous Kalanga/Shona traders from Great Zimbabwe and Swahili traders from the East African Swahili coast . Ingombe Ilede was one of the most important trading posts for rulers of Great Zimbabwe , others being the Swahili port cities like Sofala .",
      "The goods traded at Ingombe Ilede included fabrics , beads , gold , and bangles . Some of these items came from what is today southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Kilwa Kisiwani while others came from as far away as India , China and the Arab world . The African traders were later joined by the Portuguese in the 16th century .",
      "The decline of Great Zimbabwe , due to increasing trade competition from other Kalanga/Shona kingdoms like Khami and Mutapa , spelt the end of Ingombe Ilede .",
      "Second Bantu settlement .",
      "The second mass settlement of Bantu people into Zambia was of people groups that are believed to have taken the western route of the Bantu migration through the Congo Basin . These Bantu people spent the majority of their existence in what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo and are ancestors of the majority of modern Zambians .",
      "While there is some evidence that the Bemba people or AbaBemba have a strong ancient connection to the Kongo Kingdom through BaKongo ruler Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba , this is not well documented .",
      "Luba-Lunda states",
      "The Bemba , along with other related groups like the Lamba , Bisa , Senga , Kaonde , Swaka , Nkoya and Soli , formed integral parts of the Luba Kingdom in Upemba part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and have a strong relation to the BaLuba people . The area which the Luba Kingdom occupied has been inhabited by early farmers and iron workers since the 300s C.E .",
      "Over time these communities learned to use nets and harpoons , make dugout canoes , clear canals through swamps and make dams as high as 2.5 meters . As a result , they grew a diverse economy trading fish , copper and iron items and salt for goods from other parts of Africa , like the Swahili coast and , later on , the Portuguese . From these communities arose the Luba Kingdom in the 14th century .",
      "The Luba Kingdom was a large kingdom with a centralised government and smaller independent chiefdoms . It had large trading networks that linked the forests in the Congo Basin and the mineral-rich plateaus of what is today Copperbelt Province and stretched from the Atlantic coast to the Indian Ocean coast . The arts were also held in high esteem in the kingdom , and artisans were held in high regard .",
      "Literature was well developed in the Luba Kingdom . One renowned Luba genesis story that articulated the distinction between two types of Luba emperors goes as follows :",
      "Nkongolo Mwamba , the red king , and Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe , a prince of legendary black complexion . Nkongolo Mwamba is the drunken and cruel despot , Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe the refined and gentle prince . Nkongolo the Red is a man without manners , a man who eats in public , gets drunk , and cannot control himself , whereas [ Ilunga ] Mbidi Kiluwe is a man of reservation , obsessed with good manners ; he does not eat in public , controls his language and his behaviour , and keeps a distance from the vices and modus vivendi of ordinary people . Nkongolo Mwamba symbolizes the embodiment of tyranny , whereas Mbidi Kiluwe remains the admired caring and compassionate kin .",
      "In the same region of Southern Congo the Lunda people were made into a satellite of the Luba empire and adopted forms of Luba culture and governance , thus becoming the Lunda Empire to the south . According to Lunda genesis myths , a Luba hunter named Chibinda Ilunga , son of Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe , introduced the Luba model of statecraft to the Lunda sometime around 1600 when he married a local Lunda princess named Lueji and was granted control of her kingdom . Most rulers who claimed descent from Luba ancestors were integrated into the Luba empire . The Lunda kings , however , remained separate and actively expanded their political and economic dominance over the region .",
      "The Lunda , like its parent state Luba , also traded with both coasts , the Atlantic and Indian Oceans . While ruler Mwaant Yaav Naweej had established trade routes to the Atlantic coast and initiated direct contact with European traders eager for slaves and forest products and controlling the regional Copper trade , and settlements around Lake Mweru regulated commerce with the East African coast .",
      "The Luba-Lunda states eventually declined as a result of both Atlantic slave trade in the west and Indian Ocean slave trade in the east and wars with breakaway factions of the kingdoms . The Chokwe , a group that is closely related to the Luvale and formed a Lunda satellite state , initially suffered from the European demand for slaves , but once they broke away from the Lunda state , they themselves became notorious slave traders , exporting slaves to both coasts .",
      "The Chokwe eventually were defeated by the other ethnic groups and the Portuguese . This instability caused the collapse of the Luba-Lunda states and a dispersal of people into various parts of Zambia from the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The majority of Zambians trace their ancestry to the Luba-Lunda and surrounding Central African states .",
      "The Maravi Confederacy",
      "In the 1200s , before the founding of the Luba-Lunda states , a group of Bantu people started migrating from the Congo Basin to Lake Mweru then finally settled around Lake Malawi . These migrants are believed to have been one of the inhabitants around the Upemba area in the Democratic Republic of Congo . By the 1400s these groups of migrants collectively called the Maravi , and most prominently among them was the Chewa people ( AChewa ) , who started assimilating other Bantu groups like the Tumbuka .",
      "In 1480 the Maravi Empire was founded by the kalonga ( paramount chief of the Maravi ) from the Phiri clan , one of the main clans , with the others being Banda , Mwale and Nkhoma . The Maravi Empire stretched from the Indian Ocean through what today is Mozambique to Zambia and large parts of Malawi . The political organization of the Maravi resembled that of the Luba and is believed to have originated from there . The primary export of the Maravi was ivory , which was transported to Swahili brokers .",
      "Iron was also manufactured and exported . In the 1590s the Portuguese endeavoured to take monopoly over Maravi export trade . This attempt was met with outrage by the Maravi of Lundu , who unleashed their WaZimba armed force . The WaZimba sacked the Portuguese trade towns of Tete , Sena and various other towns .",
      "The Maravi are also believed to have brought the traditions that would become Nyau secret society from Upemba . The Nyau form the cosmology or indigenous religion of the people of Maravi . The Nyau society consists of ritual dance performances and masks used for the dances ; this belief system spread around the region .",
      "The Maravi declined as a result of succession disputes within the confederacy , attack by the Ngoni and slave raids from the Yao .",
      "Mutapa Empire and Mfecane",
      "As Great Zimbabwe was in decline , one of its princes , Nyatsimba Mutota , broke away from the state forming a new empire called Mutapa . The title of Mwene Mutapa , meaning Ravager of the Lands , was bestowed on him and subsequent rulers .",
      "The Mutapa Empire ruled territory between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers , in what is now Zambia , Zimbabwe and Mozambique , from the 14th to the 17th century . By its , peak Mutapa had conquered the Dande area of the Tonga and Tavara . The Mutapa Empire predominately engaged in the Indian Ocean transcontinental trade with and via the WaSwahili . The primary exported gold and ivory for silk and ceramics from Asia .",
      "Like their contemporaries in Maravi , Mutapa had problems with the arriving Portuguese traders . The peak of this uneasy relationship was reached when the Portuguese attempted to influence the kingdoms internal affairs by establishing markets in the kingdom and converting the population to Christianity . This action caused outrage by the Muslim WaSwahili living in the capital , this chaos gave the Portuguese the excuse they were searching for to warrant an attack on the kingdom and try to control its gold mines and ivory routes . This attack failed when the Portuguese succumb to disease along the Zambezi river .",
      "In the 1600s internal disputes and civil war began the decline of Mutapa . The weakened kingdom was finally conquered by the Portuguese and was eventually taken over by rival Shona states .",
      "The Portuguese also had vast estates , known as Prazos , and they used slaves and ex-slaves as security guards and hunters . They trained the men in military tactics and gave them guns . These men became expert elephant hunters and were known as the Chikunda . After the decline of the Portuguese the Chikunda made their way to Zambia .",
      "It is hypothesised by Julian Cobbing that the presence of early Europeans slave trading and attempts to control resources in various parts of Bantu Speaking Africa caused the gradual militarization of the people in the region . This can be observed with the Maravis WaZimba warrior cast who once defeating the Portuguese remained quite militaristic afterwards .",
      "The Portuguese presence in the region was also a major reason for the founding of the Rozvi Empire , a breakaway state of Mutapa . The ruler of the Rozvi , Changamire Dombo , became one of the most powerful leaders in South-Central Africas history . Under his leadership , the Rozvi defeated the Portuguese and expelled them from their trading posts along the Zambezi river .",
      "But perhaps the most notable instance of this increased militarization was the rise of the Zulu under the leadership of Shaka . Pressures from the English colonialists in the Cape and increased militarization of the Zulu resulted in the Mfecane ( the crushing ) . The Zulu expanded by assimilating the women and children of tribes they defeated , if the men of these Nguni tribes escaped slaughter , they used the military tactics of the Zulu to attack other groups .",
      "This caused mass displacements , wars and raids throughout Southern , Central and Eastern Africa as Nguni or Ngoni tribes made their way throughout the region and is referred to as the Mfecane . The arriving Nguni under the leadership of Zwagendaba crossed the Zambezi river moving northwards . The Ngoni were the final blow to the already weakened Maravi Empire . Many Nguni eventually settled around what is today Zambia , Malawi , Mozambique and Tanzania and assimilated into neighboring tribes .",
      "In the western part of Zambia , another Southern African group of Sotho-Tswana heritage called the Kololo manage to conquer the local inhabitants who were migrants from the fallen Luba and Lunda states called the Luyana or Aluyi . The Luyana established the Barotse Kingdom on the floodplains of the Zambezi upon their arrival from Katanga . Under the Kololo , the Kololo language was imposed upon the Luyana until the Luyana revolted and overthrew the Kololo by this time the Luyana language was largely forgotten and a new hybrid language emerged , SiLozi and the Luyana began to refer to themselves as Lozi .",
      "At the end of the 18th century , some of the Mbunda migrated to Barotseland , Mongu upon the migration of among others , the Ciyengele . The Aluyi and their leader , the Litunga Mulambwa , especially valued the Mbunda for their fighting ability .",
      "By the late 19th century , most of the various peoples of Zambia were established in their current areas .",
      "Colonial Period .",
      "Europeans .",
      "One of the earliest recorded European to visit the area was the Portuguese explorer Francisco de Lacerda in the late 18th century . Lacerda led an expedition from Mozambique to the Kazembe region in Zambia ( with the goal of exploring and to crossing Southern Africa from coast to coast for the first time ) , and died during the expedition in 1798 . The expedition was from then on led by his friend Francisco Pinto . This territory , located between Portuguese Mozambique and Portuguese Angola , was claimed and explored by Portugal in that period .",
      "Other European visitors followed in the 19th century . The most prominent of these was David Livingstone , who had a vision of ending the slave trade through the 3 Cs : Christianity , Commerce , and Civilisation . He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the Zambezi River in 1855 , naming them the Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom . He described them thus : Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight .",
      "Locally the falls are known as Mosi-o-Tunya or thundering smoke in the Lozi or Kololo dialect . The town of Livingstone , near the Falls , is named after him . Highly publicised accounts of his journeys motivated a wave of European visitors , missionaries and traders after his death in 1873 .",
      "British South Africa Company",
      "In 1888 , the British South Africa Company ( BSA Company ) , led by Cecil Rhodes , obtained mineral rights from the Litunga of the Lozi people , the Paramount Chief of the Lozi ( Ba-rotse ) for the area which later became Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia .",
      "To the east , in December 1897 a group of the Angoni or Ngoni ( originally from Zululand ) rebelled under Tsinco , son of King Mpezeni , but the rebellion was put down , and Mpezeni accepted the Pax Britannica . That part of the country then came to be known as North-Eastern Rhodesia . In 1895 , Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the region , and it was during this trek that Burnham discovered major copper deposits along the Kafue River .",
      "North-Eastern Rhodesia and Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia were administered as separate units until 1911 when they were merged to form Northern Rhodesia , a British protectorate . In 1923 , the BSA Company ceded control of Northern Rhodesia to the British Government after the government decided not to renew the companys charter .",
      "British colonisation .",
      "In 1923 , Southern Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe ) , a conquered territory which was also administered by the BSA Company , became a self-governing British colony . In 1924 , after negotiations , the administration of Northern Rhodesia transferred to the British Colonial Office .",
      "Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland",
      "In 1953 , the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland grouped together Northern Rhodesia , Southern Rhodesia , and Nyasaland ( now Malawi ) as a single semi-autonomous region . This was undertaken despite opposition from a sizeable minority of the population , who demonstrated against it in 1960\u201361 . Northern Rhodesia was the center of much of the turmoil and crisis characterizing the federation in its last years . Initially , Harry Nkumbulas African National Congress ( ANC ) led the campaign , which Kenneth Kaundas United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) subsequently took up .",
      "Independence .",
      "A two-stage election held in October and December 1962 resulted in an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties . The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesias secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new National Assembly based on a broader , more democratic franchise .",
      "The federation was dissolved on 31 December 1963 , and in January 1964 , Kaunda won the only election for Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia . The Colonial Governor , Sir Evelyn Hone , was very close to Kaunda and urged him to stand for the post . Soon after , there was an uprising in the north of the country known as the Lumpa Uprising led by Alice Lenshina \u2013 Kaundas first internal conflict as leader of the nation .",
      "Northern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964 , with Kenneth Kaunda as the first president . At independence , despite its considerable mineral wealth , Zambia faced major challenges . Domestically , there were few trained and educated Zambians capable of running the government , and the economy was largely dependent on foreign expertise . This expertise was provided in part by John Willson CMG There were over 70,000 Europeans resident in Zambia in 1964 , and they remained of disproportionate economic significance .",
      "Post Independence .",
      "Kaundas endorsement of Patriotic Front guerrillas conducting raids into neighbouring ( Southern ) Rhodesia resulted in political tension and a militarisation of the border , leading to its closure in 1973 . The Kariba hydroelectric station on the Zambezi River provided sufficient capacity to satisfy the countrys requirements for electricity , despite Rhodesian management .",
      "On 3 September 1978 , civilian airliner , Air Rhodesia Flight 825 , was shot down near Kariba by the Zimbabwe Peoples Revolutionary Army ( ZIPRA ) . 18 people , including children , survived the crash only for most of them to be shot by militants of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union ( ZAPU ) led by Joshua Nkomo . Rhodesia responded with Operation Gatling , an attack on Nkomos guerilla bases in Zambia , in particular , his military headquarters just outside Lusaka ; this raid became known as the Green Leader Raid . On the same day , two more bases in Zambia were attacked using air power and elite paratroops and helicopter-borne troops .",
      "A railway ( TAZARA \u2013 Tanzania Zambia Railways ) to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam , completed in 1975 with Chinese assistance , reduced Zambian dependence on railway lines south to South Africa and west through an increasingly troubled Portuguese Angola . Until the completion of the railway , Zambias major artery for imports and the critical export of copper was along the TanZam Road , running from Zambia to the port cities in Tanzania . The Tazama oil pipeline was also built from Dar es Salaam to Ndola in Zambia .",
      "By the late 1970s , Mozambique and Angola had attained independence from Portugal . Rhodesias predominantly white government , which issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 , accepted majority rule under the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979 .",
      "Civil strife in both Portuguese colonies and a mounting Namibian War of Independence resulted in an influx of refugees and compounded transportation issues . The Benguela railway , which extended west through Angola , was essentially closed to Zambian traffic by the late 1970s . Zambias support for anti-apartheid movements such as the African National Congress ( ANC ) also created security problems as the South African Defence Force struck at dissident targets during external raids .",
      "Economic troubles .",
      "In the mid-1970s , the price of copper , Zambias principal export , suffered a severe decline worldwide . In Zambias situation , the cost of transporting the copper great distances to the market was an additional strain . Zambia turned to foreign and international lenders for relief , but , as copper prices remained depressed , it became increasingly difficult to service its growing debt . By the mid-1990s , despite limited debt relief , Zambias per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world .",
      "Democratisation .",
      "In June 1990 riots against Kaunda accelerated . Many protesters were killed by the regime in breakthrough June 1990 protests . In 1990 Kaunda survived an attempted coup , and in 1991 he agreed to reinstate multiparty democracy , having instituted one-party rule under the Choma Commission of 1972 . Following multiparty elections , Kaunda was removed from office ( see below ) .",
      "In the 2000s , the economy stabilised , attaining single-digit inflation in 2006\u20132007 , real GDP growth , decreasing interest rates , and increasing levels of trade . Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices . All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country .",
      "Politics .",
      "Politics in Zambia take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic , whereby the President of Zambia is both head of state and head of government in a pluriform multi-party system . The government exercises executive power , while legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament .",
      "Zambia became a republic immediately upon attaining independence in October 1964 . From 2011 to 2014 , Zambias president had been Michael Sata , until Sata died on 28 October 2014 . After Satas death , Vice President Guy Scott , a Zambian of Scottish descent , became acting President of Zambia . Presidential elections were held on 22 January 2015 . A total number of 11 presidential candidates contested in the election and On 24 January 2015 , it was announced that Edgar Chagwa Lungu had won the election to become the 6th President in a tightly contested race . He won 48.33% of the vote , a lead of 1.66% over his closest rival , Hakainde Hichilema , with 46.67% . 9 other candidates all got less than 1% each . In August 2016 Zambian general election president Edgar Lungu won re-election narrowly in the first round of the election . The opposition had allegations of fraud and the governing Patriotic Front ( PF ) rejected the allegations made by opposition UPND party .",
      "Foreign relations .",
      "After independence in 1964 , the foreign relations of Zambia were mostly focused on supporting liberation movements in other countries in Southern Africa , such as the African National Congress and SWAPO . During the Cold War , Zambia was a member of the Non-Aligned Movement .",

After an appeal failed and the couple was sentenced to 15 years in prison , Foote asked the Zambian government to review both the case and the countrys anti-homosexuality laws . Foote faced a backlash and canceled public appearances after he was threatened on social media , and was subsequently recalled after President Lungu declared him persona non grata .",
      "Geography .",
      "Zambia is a landlocked country in southern Africa , with a tropical climate , and consists mostly of high plateaus with some hills and mountains , dissected by river valleys . At it is the 39th-largest country in the world , slightly smaller than Chile . The country lies mostly between latitudes 8\u00b0 and 18\u00b0S , and longitudes 22\u00b0 and 34\u00b0E .",
      "Zambia is drained by two major river basins : the Zambezi/Kafue basin in the center , west , and south covering about three-quarters of the country ; and the Congo basin in the north covering about one-quarter of the country . A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Rukwa in Tanzania .",
      "In the Zambezi basin , there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia : the Kabompo , Lungwebungu , Kafue , Luangwa , and the Zambezi itself , which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with Namibia , Botswana and Zimbabwe . Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola , and a number of its tributaries rise in Angolas central highlands . The edge of the Cuando River floodplain ( not its main channel ) forms Zambias southwestern border , and via the Chobe River that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most are lost by evaporation .",
      "Two of the Zambezis longest and largest tributaries , the Kafue and the Luangwa , flow mainly in Zambia . Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and Luangwa town respectively . Before its confluence , the Luangwa River forms part of Zambias border with Mozambique . From Luangwa town , the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique , and eventually into the Mozambique Channel .",
      "The Zambezi falls about over the wide Victoria Falls , located in the south-west corner of the country , subsequently flowing into Lake Kariba . The Zambezi valley , running along the southern border , is both deep and wide . From Lake Kariba going east , it is formed by grabens and like the Luangwa , Mweru-Luapula , Mweru-wa-Ntipa and Lake Tanganyika valleys , is a rift valley .",
      "The north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains . In the west the most notable being the Barotse Floodplain on the Zambezi , which floods from December to June , lagging behind the annual rainy season ( typically November to April ) . The flood dominates the natural environment and the lives , society , and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller , floodplains throughout the country .",
      "In Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and Lake Tanganyika valleys is tilted upwards to the north , and so rises imperceptibly from about in the south to in the centre , reaching in the north near Mbala . These plateau areas of northern Zambia have been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as a large section of the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands ecoregion .",
      "Eastern Zambia shows great diversity . The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north-east to south-west , extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the Lunsemfwa River . Hills and mountains are found by the side of some sections of the valley , notably in its north-east the Nyika Plateau ( ) on the Malawi border , which extend into Zambia as the Mafinga Hills , containing the countrys highest point , Mafinga Central ( ) .",
      "The Muchinga Mountains , the watershed between the Zambezi and Congo drainage basins , run parallel to the deep valley of the Luangwa River and form a sharp backdrop to its northern edge , although they are almost everywhere below . Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region . The border of the Congo Pedicle was drawn around this mountain .",
      "The southernmost headstream of the Congo River rises in Zambia and flows west through its northern area firstly as the Chambeshi and then , after the Bangweulu Swamps as the Luapula , which forms part of the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters Lake Mweru . The lakes other major tributary is the Kalungwishi River , which flows into it from the east . The Luvua River drains Lake Mweru , flowing out of the northern end to the Lualaba River ( Upper Congo River ) .",
      "Lake Tanganyika is the other major hydrographic feature that belongs to the Congo basin . Its south-eastern end receives water from the Kalambo River , which forms part of Zambias border with Tanzania . This river has Africas second highest uninterrupted waterfall , the Kalambo Falls .",

      "Zambia is located on the plateau of Central Africa , between 1000 and 1600 m above sea level . The average altitude of generally has a moderate climate . The climate of Zambia is tropical , modified by elevation . In the K\u00f6ppen climate classification , most of the country is classified as humid subtropical or tropical wet and dry , with small stretches of semi-arid steppe climate in the south-west and along the Zambezi valley .",
      "There are two main seasons , the rainy season ( November to April ) corresponding to summer , and the dry season ( May/June to October/November ) , corresponding to winter . The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season ( May/June to August ) , and the hot dry season ( September to October/November ) . The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant subtropical weather rather than tropical conditions during the cool season of May to August . However , average monthly temperatures remain above over most of the country for eight or more months of the year .",
      "Biodiversity .",
      "There are numerous ecosystems in Zambia , such as forest , thicket , woodland and grassland vegetation types .",
      "Zambia has approximately 12,505 identified species \u2013 63% animal species , 33% plant species and 4% bacterial species and other microorganisms .",
      "There are an estimated 3,543 species of wild flowering plants , consisting of sedges , herbaceous plants and woody plants . The Northern and North-Western provinces of the country especially have the highest diversity of flowering plants . Approximately 53% of flowering plants are rare and occur throughout the country .",
      "A total of 242 mammal species are found in the country , with most occupying the woodland and grassland ecosystems . The Rhodesian giraffe and Kafue lechwe are some of the well-known subspecies that are endemic to Zambia .",
      "An estimated 757 bird species have been seen in the country , of which 600 are either resident or Afrotropic migrants ; 470 breed in the country ; and 100 are non-breeding migrants . The Zambian barbet is a species endemic to Zambia .",
      "Roughly 490 known fish species , belonging to 24 fish families , have been reported in Zambia , with Lake Tanganyika having the highest number of endemic species .",
      "The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.5/10 , ranking it 39th globally out of 172 countries .",
      "Demographics .",
      "As of the 2010 Zambian census , Zambias population was 13,092,666 . Zambia is racially and ethnically diverse , with 73 distinct ethnic groups . During its occupation by the British between 1911 and 1963 , the country attracted immigrants from Europe and the Indian subcontinent , the latter of whom came as indentured workers . While most Europeans left after the collapse of white minority rule , many Asians remained .",
      "In the first census\u2014conducted on 7 May 1911\u2014there were a total of 1,497 Europeans ; 39 Asiatics and an estimated 820,000 Africans . Black Africans were not counted in the six censuses conducted in 1911 , 1921 , 1931 , 1946 , 1951 , and 1956 , prior to independence . By 1956 there were 65,277 Europeans ; 5,450 Asiatics ; 5,450 Coloureds and an estimated 2,100,000 Africans .",
      "In the 2010 population census , 99.2% were Black Africans and 0.8% consisted of other racial groups .",
      "Zambia is one of the most highly urbanised countries in sub-Saharan Africa with 44% of the population concentrated along the major transport corridors , while rural areas are sparsely populated . The fertility rate was 6.2 ( 6.1 in 1996 , 5.9 in 2001\u201302 ) .",
      "Largest towns .",
      "The onset of industrial copper mining on the Copperbelt in the late 1920s triggered rapid urbanisation . Although urbanisation was overestimated during the colonial period , it was substantial . Mining townships on the Copperbelt soon dwarfed existing centres of population and continued to grow rapidly following Zambian independence . Economic decline on the Copperbelt from the 1970s to the 1990s has altered patterns of urban development but the countrys population remains concentrated around the railway and roads running south from the Copperbelt through Kapiri Mposhi , Lusaka , Choma and Livingstone .",
      "Ethnic groups .",
      "The population comprises approximately 73 ethnic groups , most of which are Bantu-speaking . Almost 90% of Zambians belong to the nine main ethnolinguistic groups : the Nyanja-Chewa , Bemba , Tonga , Tumbuka , Lunda , Luvale , Kaonde , Nkoya and Lozi . In the rural areas , ethnic groups are concentrated in particular geographic regions . Many groups are small and not well known . However , all the ethnic groups can be found in significant numbers in Lusaka and the Copperbelt . In addition to the linguistic dimension , tribal identities are relevant in Zambia . These tribal identities are often linked to family allegiance or to traditional authorities . The tribal identities are nested within the main language groups .",
      "Immigrants , mostly British or South African , as well as some white Zambian citizens of British descent , live mainly in Lusaka and in the Copperbelt in northern Zambia , where they are either employed in mines , financial and related activities or retired . There were 70,000 Europeans in Zambia in 1964 , but many have since left the country .",
      "Zambia has a small but economically important Asian population , most of whom are Arabs , Indians and Chinese . This minority group has a massive impact on the economy controlling the manufacturing sector . An estimated 80,000 Chinese are resident in Zambia . In recent years , several hundred dispossessed white farmers have left Zimbabwe at the invitation of the Zambian government , to take up farming in the Southern province .",
      "Zambia has a minority of coloureds of mixed race . During colonialism , segregation separated coloureds , blacks and whites in public places including schools , hospitals , and in housing . There has been an increase in interracial relationships due to Zambias growing economy importing labor . Coloureds are not recorded on the census but are considered a minority in Zambia .",
      "According to the World Refugee Survey 2009 published by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants , Zambia had a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 88,900 . The majority of refugees in the country came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( 47,300 refugees from the DRC living in Zambia in 2007 ) , Angola ( 27,100 ; see Angolans in Zambia ) , Zimbabwe ( 5,400 ) and Rwanda ( 4,900 ) . Zambians are generally welcome to foreigners .",
      "Beginning in May 2008 , the number of Zimbabweans in Zambia began to increase significantly ; the influx consisted largely of Zimbabweans formerly living in South Africa who were fleeing xenophobic violence there . Nearly 60,000 refugees live in camps in Zambia , while 50,000 are mixed in with the local populations . Refugees who wish to work in Zambia must apply for permits which can cost up to $500 per year .",
      "Religion .",
      "Zambia is a Christian nation according to the 1996 constitution , but a wide variety of religious traditions exist . Traditional religious thoughts blend easily with Christian beliefs in many of the countrys syncretic churches . About three-fourths of the population is Protestant while about 20% follow Roman Catholicism . Christian denominations include Catholicism , Anglicanism , Pentecostalism , New Apostolic Church , Lutheranism , Jehovahs Witnesses , the Seventh-day Adventist Church , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , Branhamites , and a variety of Evangelical denominations .",
      "These grew , adjusted and prospered from the missionary settlements ( Portuguese and Catholicism in the east from Mozambique ) and Anglicanism ( British influences ) from the south . Except for some technical positions ( e.g . physicians ) , Western missionary roles have been assumed by native believers . After Frederick Chiluba ( a Pentecostal Christian ) became president in 1991 , Pentecostal congregations expanded considerably around the country . Zambia has one of the largest percentage of Seventh-day Adventist per capita in the world , accounting for about 1 in 18 Zambians . The Lutheran Church of Central Africa has over 11,000 members in the country .",
      "Counting only active preachers , Jehovahs Witnesses in Zambia have over 204,000 adherents with over 930,000 attending their annual observance of Christs death in 2018 . These have been preaching there since 1911 .",
      "One in 11 Zambians is a member of the New Apostolic Church . With membership above 1,200,000 the Zambia district of the church is the third-largest after Congo East and East Africa ( Nairobi ) .",
      "Followers of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Zambia number over 160,000 , or 1.5% of the population . The William Mmutle Masetlha Foundation run by the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community is particularly active in areas such as literacy and primary health care . Approximately 1% of the population is Muslim or Hindu , mostly living in urban areas . There are about 500 people who belong to the Ahmadiyya sect . There is also a small Jewish community , composed mostly of Ashkenazis .",
      "Languages .",
      "The exact number of Zambian languages is not known although many texts claim that Zambia has 73 languages or 73 languages and dialects . The figure 73 languages is probably due to a non-distinction between language and dialect using the criterion of mutual intelligibility . If this criterion was used , the number of Zambian languages would probably be about 20 or 30 only .",
      "The official language of Zambia is English , which is used for official business and instruction in schools . The main local language , especially in Lusaka , is Nyanja ( Chewa ) , followed by Bemba . In the Copperbelt Bemba is the main language and Nyanja second . Bemba and Nyanja are spoken in the urban areas in addition to other indigenous languages which are commonly spoken in Zambia . These include Lozi , Kaonde , Tonga , Lunda and Luvale , which feature on the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation ( ZNBC ) local languages section .",
      "Urbanisation has had a dramatic effect on some of the indigenous languages , including the assimilation of words from other languages . Urban dwellers sometimes differentiate between urban and rural dialects of the same language by prefixing the rural languages with deep .",
      "Most will thus speak Bemba and Nyanja in the Copperbelt ; Nyanja is dominantly spoken in Lusaka and Eastern Zambia . English is used in official communications and is the language of choice at home among \u2013 now common \u2013 interethnic families . This evolution of languages has led to Zambian slang heard throughout Lusaka and other major cities . The majority of Zambians usually speak more than one language , the official language , English , and the most spoken language in the town or area they live in . Portuguese has been introduced as a second language into the school curriculum due to the presence of a large Portuguese-speaking Angolan community . French is commonly studied in private schools , while some secondary schools have it as an optional subject . A German course has been introduced at the University of Zambia ( UNZA ) .",
      "Education .",
      "The right to equal and adequate education for all is enshrined within the Zambian constitution . The Education Act of 2011 regulates equal and quality education . The Ministry of General Education effectively oversees the provision of quality education through policy and regulation of the education curriculum .",
      "Fundamentally , the aim of education in Zambia is to promote the full and well-rounded development of the physical , intellectual , social , affective , moral , and spiritual qualities of all learners . The education system has three core structures : Early childhood education and Primary education ( Grades 1 \u2013 7 ) , Secondary education ( Grades 8 \u2013 12 ) and Tertiary education . Adult Literacy programs are available for semi-literate and illiterate individuals .",
      "The governments annual expenditure on education has increased over the years , increasing from 16.1% in 2006 to 20.2% in 2015 .",
      "Health .",
      "Zambia is experiencing a generalised HIV/AIDS epidemic , with a national HIV prevalence rate of 12.40% among adults . The maternal mortality rate was 398 per 100,000 live births in 2014 , compared to 591 in 2007 . Over the same period , the under-5 mortality rate dropped to 75 from 119 per 1,000 live births . The prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS for adults aged 15\u201349 decreased to 13 per cent in 2013/14 , from 16 per cent in 2001/02 .",
      "Economy .",
      "Presently , Zambia averages between $7.5 billion and $8 billion of exports annually . It totalled $9.1 billion worth of exports in 2018 About 60.5% of Zambians live below the recognised national poverty line , with rural poverty rates standing at about 77.9% and urban rates at about 27.5% . Unemployment and underemployment in urban areas are serious problems . Most rural Zambians are subsistence farmers .",
      "Zambia ranked 117th out of 128 countries on the 2007 Global Competitiveness Index , which looks at factors that affect economic growth . Social indicators continue to decline , particularly in measurements of life expectancy at birth ( about 40.9 years ) and maternal mortality ( 830 per 100,000 pregnancies ) .",
      "Zambia fell into poverty after international copper prices declined in the 1970s . The socialist regime made up for falling revenue with several abortive attempts at International Monetary Fund structural adjustment programs ( SAPs ) . The policy of not trading through the main supply route and line of rail to the sea \u2013 the territory was known as Rhodesia ( from 1965 to 1979 ) , and now known as Zimbabwe \u2013 cost the economy greatly . After the Kaunda regime , ( from 1991 ) successive governments began limited reforms . The economy stagnated until the late 1990s . In 2007 Zambia recorded its ninth consecutive year of economic growth . Inflation was 8.9% , down from 30% in 2000 .",
      "Zambia is still dealing with economic reform issues such as the size of the public sector , and improving Zambias social sector delivery systems . Economic regulations and red tape are extensive , and corruption is widespread . The bureaucratic procedures surrounding the process of obtaining licences encourages the widespread use of facilitation payments . Zambias total foreign debt exceeded $6 billion when the country qualified for Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative ( HIPC ) debt relief in 2000 , contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria . Initially , Zambia hoped to reach the HIPC completion point , and benefit from substantial debt forgiveness , in late 2003 .",
      "In January 2003 , the Zambian government informed the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatisation of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities . Although agreements were reached on these issues , subsequent overspending on civil service wages delayed Zambias final HIPC debt forgiveness from late 2003 to early 2005 , at the earliest . In an effort to reach HIPC completion in 2004 , the government drafted an austerity budget for 2004 , freezing civil service salaries and increasing the number of taxes . The tax hike and public sector wage freeze prohibited salary increases and new hires . This sparked a nationwide strike in February 2004 .",
      "The Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification program to reduce the economys reliance on the copper industry . This initiative seeks to exploit other components of Zambias rich resource base by promoting agriculture , tourism , gemstone mining , and hydro-power . In July 2018 , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Zambias President Edgar Lungu signed 12 agreements in capital Lusaka on areas ranging from trade and investment to tourism and diplomacy .",
      "Mining .",
      "The Zambian economy has historically been based on the copper mining industry . The output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 metric tons in 1998 after a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment , low copper prices , and uncertainty over privatisation . In 2002 , following the privatisation of the industry , copper production rebounded to 337,000 metric tons . Improvements in the world copper market have magnified the effect of this volume increase on revenues and foreign exchange earnings .",
      "In 2003 , exports of nonmetals increased by 25% and accounted for 38% of all export earnings , previously 35% . The Zambian government has recently been granting licenses to international resource companies to prospect for minerals such as nickel , tin , copper , and uranium . The government of Zambia hopes that nickel will take over from copper as the countrys top metallic export . In 2009 , Zambia was badly hit by the world economic crisis .",
      "Agriculture .",
      "Agriculture plays a very important part in Zambias economy providing many more jobs than the mining industry .",
      "A small number of white Zimbabwean farmers were welcomed into Zambia after their expulsion by Robert Mugabe , whose numbers had reached roughly 150 to 300 people . They farm a variety of crops including tobacco , wheat , and chili peppers on an estimated 150 farms . The skills they brought , combined with general economic liberalisation under the late Zambian president Levy Mwanawasa , has been credited with stimulating an agricultural boom in Zambia . In 2004 , for the first time in 26 years , Zambia exported more corn than it imported . In December 2019 , the Zambian government unanimously decided to legalize cannabis for medicinal and export purposes only .",
      "Tourism .",
      "Zambia has some of natures best wildlife and game reserves affording the country with abundant tourism potential . The North Luangwa , South Luangwa and Kafue National Parks have one of the most prolific animal populations in Africa . The Victoria Falls in the Southern part of the country is a major tourist attraction .",
      "With 73 ethnic groups , there is also a myriad of traditional ceremonies that take place every year .",
      "Energy .",
      "In 2009 , Zambia generated 10.3 TWh of electricity and has been rated high in use of both Solar power and Hydroelectricity . However , , Zambia began experiencing a serious energy shortage due to the poor 2014/2015 rain season , which resulted in low water levels at the Kariba dam and other major dams . In September 2019 , African Green Resources ( AGR ) announced that it would invest $150 million in 50 megawatt ( MW ) solar farm , along with irrigation dam and expanding the existing grain silo capacity by 80,000 tonnes .",
      "Culture .",
      "Prior to the establishment of modern Zambia , the inhabitants lived in independent tribes , each with its own way of life . One of the results of the colonial era was the growth of urbanisation . Different ethnic groups started living together in towns and cities , influencing each others way of life . They also started adopting aspects of global or universal culture , especially in terms of dressing and mannerisms . Much of the original cultures of Zambia have largely survived in rural areas , with some outside influence such as Christianity being widely practiced . Cultures that are specific to certain ethnic groups within Zambia are known as Zambian cultures while those lifestyles that are common across ethnic groups are labelled Zambian culture because they are practiced by almost every Zambian . In the urban setting , there is a continuous integration and evolution of these cultures to produce what is called Zambian culture .",
      "Zambia practices several ceremonies and rituals ranging from nationally recognised traditional ceremonies to unrecognised yet important ceremonies . Many of the ceremonies and rituals are performed on special occasions celebrating or marking achievements , anniversaries , the passage of time , coronations and presidential occasions , atonement and purification , graduation , dedication , oaths of allegiance , initiation , marriage , funeral , birth ceremonies and others .",
      "Like most African countries , Zambia practices both disclosed and undisclosed ceremonies and rituals . Among the disclosed ceremonies and rituals include calendrical or seasonal , contingent , affliction , divination , initiation and regular or daily ceremonies . Undisclosed ceremonies include those practiced in secret such as spiritual groups ( e.g . Nyau and Makishi dancers ) and traditional marriage counsellors such as alangizi women . As of December 2016 , Zambia had 77 calendrical or seasonal traditional ceremonies recognized by government and this number will increase in the near future . These calendrical ceremonies that takes place once per year include Nc\u2019wala , Kulonga , Kuoboka , Malaila , Nsengele , Chibwela kumushi , Dantho , Ntongo , Makundu , Lwiindi , Chuungu , and Lyenya . These known as Zambian traditional ceremonies . Some of the more prominent are : Kuomboka and Kathanga ( Western Province ) , Mutomboko ( Luapula Province ) , Kulamba and Ncwala ( Eastern Province ) , Lwiindi and Shimunenga ( Southern Province ) , Lunda Lubanza ( North Western ) , Likumbi Lyamize ( North Western ) , Mbunda Lukwakwa ( North Western Province ) , Chibwela Kumushi ( Central Province ) , Vinkhakanimba ( Muchinga Province ) , Ukusefya Pa Ngwena ( Northern Province ) .",
      "Popular traditional arts include pottery , basketry ( such as Tonga baskets ) , stools , fabrics , mats , wooden carvings , ivory carvings , wire craft , and copper crafts . Most Zambian traditional music is based on drums ( and other percussion instruments ) with a lot of singing and dancing . In urban areas , foreign genres of music are popular , particularly Congolese rumba , African-American music and Jamaican reggae .",
      "Media .",
      "The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services in Zambia is responsible for the Zambian News Agency , while there are also numerous media outlets throughout the country which include ; television stations , newspapers , FM radio stations , and Internet news websites .",
      "Sports and Games .",
      "Sports and games are common social aspects of Zambian culture ( s ) that brings people together for learning , development of skills , fun and joyous moments . Sports and games in Zambia include but not limited to football , athletics , netball , volleyball and indigenous games such as nsolo , chiyenga , waida , hide and seek , walyako , and sojo . These are some of the indigenous games that support socialisation . All these sports and games are part of the Zambian culture ( s ) . The fact that the games are played by more than one person makes them social and edutainment events . The history of some of these games is as old as Zambians themselves . However , Zambia started taking part in popular global sports and games mainly in 1964 Summer olympics .",
      "Zambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the 1964 Summer Olympics , thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic game as one country , and leave it as another . In 2016 , Zambia participated for the thirteenth time in the Olympic games . Two medals were won . The medals were won successively in boxing and on the track . In 1984 Keith Mwila won a bronze medal in the light flyweight . In 1996 Samuel Matete won a silver medal in the 400-metre hurdles . Zambia has never participated in the Winter Olympics .",
      "Football is the most popular sport in Zambia , and the Zambia national football team has had its triumphant moments in football history . At the Seoul Olympics in 1988 , the national team defeated the Italian national team with a score of 4\u20130 . Kalusha Bwalya , Zambias most celebrated football player , and one of Africas greatest football players in history scored a hat trick in that match . However , to this day , many pundits say the greatest team Zambia has ever assembled was the one that perished on 28 April 1993 in a plane crash at Libreville , Gabon . Despite this , in 1996 , Zambia was ranked 15th on the official FIFA World Football Team rankings , the highest attained by any southern African team . In 2012 , Zambia won the African Cup of Nations for the first time after losing in the final twice . They beat C\u00f4te dIvoire 8\u20137 in a penalty shoot-out in the final , which was played in Libreville , just a few kilometers away from the plane crash 19 years previously .",
      "Rugby Union , boxing and cricket are also popular sports in Zambia . Notably , at one point in the early 2000s , the Australia and South Africa national rugby teams were captained by players born in the same Lusaka hospital , George Gregan and Corn\u00e9 Krige . Zambia boasts having the highest rugby poles in the world , located at Luanshya Sports Complex in Luanshya .",
      "Rugby union in Zambia is a minor but growing sport . They are currently ranked 73rd by the IRB and have 3,650 registered players and three formally organised clubs . Zambia used to play cricket as part of Rhodesia . Zambia has also strangely provided a shinty international , Zambian-born Eddie Tembo representing Scotland in the compromise rules Shinty/Hurling game against Ireland in 2008 .",
      "In 2011 , Zambia was due to host the tenth All-Africa Games , for which three stadiums were to be built in Lusaka , Ndola , and Livingstone . The Lusaka stadium would have a capacity of 70,000 spectators while the other two stadiums would hold 50,000 people each . The government was encouraging the private sector to get involved in the construction of the sports facilities because of a shortage of public funds for the project . Zambia later withdrew its bid to host the 2011 All-Africa Games , citing a lack of funds . Hence , Mozambique took Zambias place as host .",
      "Zambia also produced the first black African ( Madalitso Muthiya ) to play in the United States Golf Open , one of the four major golf tournaments .",
      "In 1989 , the countrys basketball team had its best performance when it qualified for the FIBA Africa Championship and thus finished as one of Africas top ten teams .",
      "In 2017 , Zambia hosted and won the Pan-African football tournament U-20 African Cup of Nation for players age 20 and under .",
      "Music and dance .",
      "Zambias culture has been an integral part of their development post-independence such as the uprising of cultural villages and private museums . The music which introduced dance is part of their cultural expression and it embodies the beauty and spectacle of life in Zambia , from the intricacies of the talking drums to the Kamangu drum used to announce the beginning of Malaila traditional ceremony . Dance as a practice serves as a unifying factor bringing the people together as one .",
      "Zamrock .",
      "Zamrock is a musical genre that emerged in the 1970s , and has developed a cult following in the West . Zamrock has been described as mixing traditional Zambian music with heavy repetitive riffs similar to groups such as Jimi Hendrix , James Brown , Black Sabbath , Rolling Stones , Deep Purple , and Cream . Notable groups in the genre include Rikki Ililonga and his band Musi-O-Tunya , WITCH , Chrissy Zebby Tembo , and Paul Ngozi and his Ngozi Family ."

      "Rudolphus Franciscus Marie Ruud Lubbers ( ; 7 May 1939 \u2013 14 February 2018 ) was a Dutch politician and diplomat of the Catholic Peoples Party ( KVP ) that merged to become the Christian Democratic Appeal ( CDA ) party and businessman who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 4 November 1982 to 22 August 1994 , and as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 1 January 2001 until 20 February 2005 .",
      "Lubbers studied Economics at the Rotterdam School of Economics obtaining a Master of Economics degree and worked as a corporate director for the manufacturing company in Rotterdam from April 1963 until May 1973 and as trade association executive for the Christian Employers Association ( NCW ) from January 1965 until May 1973 . After the election of 1972 Lubbers was appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs in the Cabinet Den Uyl taking office on 11 May 1973 .

Following the cabinet formation of 1977 Lubbers was asked to become Minister of Housing and Spatial Planning in the new cabinet but declined and returned as a Member of the House of Representatives on 22 December 1977 , serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Economic Affairs . Following the resignation of Parliamentary leader Willem Aantjes Lubbers was selected as his successor taking office on 7 November 1978 .",
      "Shortly after the election of 1981 incumbent Prime Minister and Leader Dries van Agt unexpectedly announced he was stepping down and Lubbers was anonymously selected as his successor as Leader and the de facto next Prime Minister . Following cabinet formation of 1982 Lubbers formed the Cabinet Lubbers I and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office on 4 November 1982 . For the election of 1986 Lubbers served as Lijsttrekker ( top candidate ) and after a cabinet formation formed the Cabinet Lubbers II and continued as Prime Minister for a second term . For the election of 1989 Lubbers again served as Lijsttrekker and following another successful cabinet formation formed the Cabinet Lubbers III and continued as Prime Minister for a third term . In October 1993 Lubbers announced he was stepping down as Leader , and that he would not stand atthe election of 1994 or serve another term as Prime Minister . He left office at the installation of the Cabinet Kok I on 22 August 1994 .",
      "Lubbers semi-retired from active politics and became active in the public sector as a non-profit director and served on several and councils on behalf of the government , he also served as a distinguished visiting professor of International relations and Globalization at the Tilburg University and the John F . Kennedy School of Government of the Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts from February 1995 until December 2000 . In November 2000 Lubbers was nominated as the next United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees serving from 1 January 2001 until 20 February 2005 . Following his retirement Lubbers continued to be active public sector and worked as an advocate , lobbyist and activist for Humanitarian , Conservation , Environmentalism , Sustainable development and Climate change issues .",
      "Lubbers was known for his abilities as a team leader and consensus builder . During his premiership , his cabinets were responsible for major reforms to Social security , stimulating Privatization and Sustainable development , revitalizing the economy following the recession in the 1980s and reducing the deficit . Lubbers was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 31 January 1995 and continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death at the age of 78 . He is both the youngest Prime Minister of the Netherlands at 43 years , and the longest-serving with , and is consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the best Prime Ministers after World War II .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early life .",
      "Rudolphus Franciscus Marie Lubbers was born on 7 May 1939 in Rotterdam in the Province of South Holland . He studied economics at the Erasmus University Rotterdam , and was a student of the first Nobel Prize in Economics laureate Jan Tinbergen . As suggested by the title of his 1962 thesis \u2013 The influence of differing productivity trends in various countries on the current account of the balance of payments \u2013 his main interest was in monetary affairs . He originally planned an academic career , but was compelled by family circumstances to join the management of Lubbers Construction Workshops and Machinery Fabricators Hollandia B.V .",
      "Politics .",
      "From 11 May 1973 to 19 December 1977 , Ruud Lubbers was Minister of Economic Affairs in the Den Uyl-government and a member of the Catholic Peoples Party ( KVP ) . He was an effective , if sometimes somewhat bad-tempered minister . He chose to return to Parliament on the formation of the Van Agt-government in 1977 , becoming senior deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal ( CDA ) , the alliance between the KVP and the other two main Christian parties . His career got an unexpected boost when the leader of the parliamentary faction of the CDA , Willem Aantjes , had to resign in 1978 because of accusations that he had served in the Germanic-SS during the Second World War . Lubbers succeeded him and suddenly found himself in a powerful political position .",
      "In 1982 , after the general election won by Prime Minister Dries van Agt , a similar thing happened when Van Agt suddenly announced he would not serve for a third term . Lubbers took over the post . He was the youngest prime minister in Dutch history ; he had turned 43 only six months earlier . Major aspects of his time in office included extensive cutbacks in public spending , the launch of far-reaching deregulation and privatisation programs , and a massive demonstration in The Hague ( 1983 ) against the planned installation in the Netherlands of nuclear-armed U.S . cruise missiles ( which was cancelled after all due to arms reduction talks between the US and the Soviet Union ) .",
      "After leaving office in 1994 , Lubbers was put forward as a candidate for the head of NATO , but the U.S . vetoed his appointment . He was on the advisory board of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum ( OMFIF ) , where he was regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system .",
      "Lubbers was regarded by many during his time in office as an ideological heir to Margaret Thatcher . One of his campaign slogans was : Meer markt , minder overheid ( more market , less government ) .",
      "Ecological activities .",
      "In the follow-up of the Earth Summit in 1992 , Lubbers engaged with the Earth Charter Initiative in cooperation with Mikhail Gorbachev and Maurice Strong . The Earth Charter document was launched in the Peace Palace in The Hague in June 2000 . Lubbers was an active member of the international Earth Charter Commission and reached out , especially to youth in the Netherland , with the message of the Earth Charter for a sustainable and peaceful world .",
      "Academic .",
      "From 1995 to 2000 , he taught Globalization Studies at Tilburg University in the Netherlands and at the John F . Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the United States . He was also vice-chairman of the Independent World Commission on the Oceans and chair of Globus , the Institute for Globalization and Development based in Tilburg .",
      "UN High Commissioner for Refugees .",
      "At the end of the year 2000 , Lubbers was appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan to succeed Sadako Ogata as UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) .",
      "From 1 January 2001 , Lubbers headed the UNHCR , which comprised over 5,000 employees who work across the globe , and which was concerned with an estimated 21 million refugees and internally displaced in over 120 countries worldwide . During his tenure , the number of refugees worldwide decreased by almost 22% , from 21.8 million in 2001 to close to 17.1 million at the beginning of 2004 .",
      "Lubbers also favoured a generous refugee policy for the Netherlands , and he was critical of the Foreign Citizens Law ( Vreemdelingenwet ) . He also stabilised the UNHCRs financial situation and greatly increased the financial means for the sheltering of refugees .",
      "He annually donated some $300,000 to the refugee agency since he assumed his post in 2001 , thereby covering his own $167,000 annual salary and travel expenses .",
      "Sexual harassment complaint .",
      "In May 2004 , Lubbers was accused by Cynthia Brzak , an American UNHCR employee , of sexual harassment following a meeting in his office that was attended by two other UNHCR staff members . The complaint was reported in the media , prompting Lubbers to inform UNHCR staff about the accusation . On this occasion , he denied any wrongdoing and rejected the allegation against him . On 2 June 2004 , the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services ( OIOS ) , which was tasked with investigating the accusation , sent its report to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan . In its public annual report to the UN Secretary-General ( presented to the UN General Assembly ) , the OIOS reported concerning the case that it had submitted a report to the Secretary-General supporting the allegations and recommended that appropriate actions be taken accordingly .",
      "Lubbers responded to the OIOS report in a letter setting out to ( a ) deny acts of sexual harassment or abuse took place ; ( b ) establish that such evidence of the alleged misconduct as is said to exist is insufficient and flawed ; and ( c ) conclude that the report itself would appear to be based on an irregular statutory basis and also flawed by errors of law and reasoning .",
      "Lubbers asked Max van der Stoel , former High Commissioner on National Minorities , to comment on the confidential report . He concluded that the OIOS report is deficient in objectivity and impartiality . He added that the only two other persons in the room did not provide evidence confirming the version given by the complainant . Furthermore , he accused UN officials of leaking information to the press and recommended that an investigation of the leaks be undertaken .",
      "The Secretary-General reviewed the report and the responses of the High Commissioner and the senior manager to the report , and decided that the complaint could not be substantiated by the evidence and therefore closed the matter . He is also reported to have consulted with Stephen Schwebel , an American judge and former President of the International Court of Justice . The Secretary-General failed to order an investigation of the deliberate leaking by OIOS itself to the media as recommended by Max van der Stoel .",
      "Resignation .",
      "In February 2005 , the case was in the news again when the British daily newspaper The Independent obtained a copy of the OIOS report and , accompanied by an article by Kate Holt , published its contents . Among other things , the report stated that : the allegation against Lubbers is substantiated in that Lubbers did engage in unwanted physical contact with the complainant , a subordinate female staff member . New allegations that came to OIOSs attention during the investigation , were also examined and indicate a pattern of sexual harassment by Lubbers , OIOS is also of the view that Lubbers abused his authority as High Commissioner by his intense , pervasive and intimidating attempts to influence the outcome of this Investigation .",
      "Lubbers met with the Secretary-General on 18 February 2005 , and resigned as High Commissioner on Sunday , 20 February 2005 , stating to the press : For more than four years I gave all my energy to UNHCR . To be frank , despite all my loyalty , insult has now been added to injury and therefore I resign as High Commissioner . The Secretary-Generals office issued a statement the same day which stated that the High Commissioners resignation was in the best interests of the UNHCR . In his letter of resignation , Lubbers stated that his resignation constituted no expression of guilt , but that he had become the victim of smearing , adding that he had resigned in the interest of the organisation . In October 2005 , Annan reiterated that he had come to the conclusion that the evidence did not support the accusation but that , because of ongoing media-pressure , Lubbers resignation was in the best interests of the UNHCR .",
      "During a farewell meeting for Lubbers as High Commissioner for Refugees , he received from Acting High Commissioner Wendy Chamberlin the first annual UNHCR Achievement Award for exceptional services to UNHCR and for the worlds refugees .",
      "In a formal statement , Netherlands Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende called the departure of Lubbers bitter , since the complaint against him had been dismissed as unsustainable .",
      "Handling of the UNHCR/SC-UK 2002 report on sexual exploitation in the aid sector in West Africa",
      "Three years prior to the controversy over the sexual harassment case , Ruud Lubbers was criticised for his mis-handling of the UNHCR/SC-UK 2002 which uncovered the widespread sexual exploitation of refugee children by aid workers and peacekeepers in three West African countries ( Liberia , Guinea and Sierra Leone ) . The study team which had encountered these findings unexpectedly whilst conducting a broader assessment documented 67 allegations implicating 40 aid agencies and several peacekeeping battalions , and often involving humanitarian workers and peacekeepers exchanging meagre aid supplies ( biscuits , soap , plastic sheeting ) for sex with children .",
      "Ruud Lubbers response was to deny these findings , discredit the authors and excuse these behaviours ; for example in a CNN interview on 8 May 2002 , Lubbers was heard to deny the problem in the face of CNNs own research which confirmed the problem existed and was taken to task by the interviewer for dismissing these exploitative relationships inter alia as romances . He was roundly criticised by his own staff for that interview . Despite repeated attempts by Lubbers to lead a negative campaign against the report , the international community and governments in particular , took the allegations seriously and passed a UN General Assembly resolution A/RES/57/306 , Investigation into sexual exploitation of refugees by aid workers in West Africa in May 2003 , requiring the UN to take action at the highest level to tackle such abuses . This led to the UN Secretary-Generals Bulletin , Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse in October 2003 , and an endorsement of the Inter-agency standing Committees working group on sexual abuse and exploitation which had already been set up a year earlier in June 2002 in response to the report .",
      "Informateur .",
      "After the fall of the Second Balkenende cabinet , Lubbers became the informateur for the formation of the demissionary interim Third Balkenende cabinet .",
      "For the 2010 Dutch cabinet formation , after coalition meetings between Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy , Labour Party , Democrats 66 , and GreenLeft failed to form a new Purple government , Lubbers was asked again to become Informateur to seek possibilities for a new coalition .",
      "Personal life and death .",
      "On 10 October 1962 , Lubbers married Ria Hoogeweegen ( born 12 November 1940 ) and had two sons and one daughter , Paul , Bart and Heleen .",
      "Lubbers died in Rotterdam on 14 February 2018 , at the age of 78 , of natural causes . Among the world leaders who offered condolences were former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev , Prime Minister of Russia and former President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev , Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel , Secretary-General of the United Nations and former Prime Minister of Portugal and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Ant\u00f3nio Guterres , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi and President of the European Commission and former Prime Ministers of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker . His ceremonial funeral was held in Rotterdam on 20 February 2018 and was attended by Prime Minister Mark Rutte and all living former Prime Ministers Dries van Agt , Wim Kok and Jan Peter Balkenende and other high-profile ( former ) politicians . This was also the last public appearance of his successor as Prime Minister Wim Kok , who himself died eight months later at the age of 80 .",

      "Westover Plantation",
      "Westover Plantation is a historic colonial tidewater plantation located on the north bank of the James River in Charles City County , Virginia . Established in c . 1730\u20131750 , it is the homestead of the Byrd family of Virginia . State Route 5 , a scenic byway , runs east\u2013west to the north of the plantation , connecting the independent cities of Richmond and Williamsburg .",
      "The plantation has been designated as a National Historic Landmark in the United States , cited for the architectural quality of its early Georgian mansion house and the history of its influential family . In the early years of the Virginia colony , the plantation was one of the sites of the courts of Charles City County .",
      "History .",
      "Sir John Pawlett , by deeds of lease and release , demised most of Westover Plantation in 1665 to Theodorick Bland of Westover for \u00a3170 . Bland lived on the property until his death in 1671 and was buried in the chancel of the original Westover Church , which he helped build . His eldest son , Theodorick , inherited the land and joined with his brother , Richard , in its ownership . The brothers eventually conveyed 1,200 acres of the property to William Byrd I in 1688 for \u00a3300 and 10,000 pounds of tobacco and cask .",
      "The plantation is notable for its 18th-century and later history . The mansion , Westover Plantation , was built in the Georgian style . It was considered the seat of the William Byrd family in Virginia . William Byrd II , the founder of Richmond , was thought to have built the mansion c . 1730 . This date was part of the 1960 designation of the house as a National Historic Landmark .",
      "But , since the late 20th century , recent dendrochronologic testing on boards and planks in the house showed that they dated to the 1750s . The house was thus probably built and first occupied by William Byrd III , not his father . The revised construction date has been recognized by the National Park Service .",
      "Like the other plantations along the James River , Westover was first devoted to the cultivation of tobacco , the major commodity of colonial Tidewater Virginia . The Byrd family depended on the labor of hundreds of enslaved Africans , as tobacco was a labor-intensive crop . The original grounds included slave quarters . In addition to working as field hands , other slaves worked as domestic servants and skilled artisans of many types . Tobacco cultivation exhausted the soil and , pushed also by changes in markets , in the 19th century planters shifted to mixed crops , which were less labor-intensive . As development of the Deep South ensued , planters in the Upper South sold excess slaves in the domestic slave trade , which continued to the Civil War .",
      "During the American Civil War , Westover was used as headquarters of the Union Fifth Corps and one of the wings burned during this time . After the death of William Byrd IIIs widow in 1814 , Westover was sold out of the Byrd family . Since then , Westover has had three subsequent owners , including lawyer John Armistead Selden ( a member of the Selden family and the Lee family ) , whose detailed diaries of daily life at Westover remain in publication as a popular primary source on the economic and cultural history of nineteenth-century Virginian agriculture , and Confederate Army officer Augustus Harrison Drewry . Drewry , who is best known for commanding the gun batteries of Fort Darling during Battle of Drewrys Bluff in 1862 , lived at Westover until his death in 1899 and made many changes ; including rebuilding the burned wing , connecting the dependencies and enlarging the dining room so that it ran the depth of the house .",
      "In the early 20th century , Westover was acquired by United States diplomat Richard Teller Crane , II , who restored the mansion and grounds . It has remained in the Crane family ever since . The site was damaged by Hurricane Isabel in 2003 . Ten feet of riverbank , a 250-year-old road , and a 150-year-old poplar from the south lawn were eroded into the river during the storm .",
      "Architecture .",
      "The house is noteworthy for its symmetry and balance of proportions , secret passages , magnificent gardens , front door , and its Georgian style ( which was inspired by the Governors Palace in Williamsburg , Virginia ) . The grounds and garden are open to the public from 9 a.m . to 6 p.m . daily , and you can tour the mansion with an appointment ."

      "New Orleans Baby Cakes",
      "The New Orleans Baby Cakes ( formerly the New Orleans Zephyrs ) were a Minor League Baseball team in the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins . They were located in Metairie , Louisiana and played their home games at the Shrine on Airline .",
      "The team began play in 1993 as a member of the Triple-A American Association ( AA ) when the Denver Zephyrs relocated to Metairie . They joined the PCL in 1998 . New Orleans has qualified for the postseason on three occasions and has won the PCL championship twice as the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Astros ( 1998 and 2001 ) .",
      "At the end of the 2019 season , the team relocated to Wichita , Kansas , where they continue as the Wichita Wind Surge . Initially , the city of New Orleans hoped to bring a Double-A Southern League team to the city and continue operations as the Baby Cakes . However , due to Major League Baseballs reorganization of Minor League Baseball , the league ceased operations in 2021 and the campaign ultimately failed .",
      "History .",
      "Professional baseball was first played in New Orleans in the late 19th century . The citys longest-running team was the New Orleans Pelicans who played off and on from 1887 to 1977 primarily in the Southern Association . The Pelicans left after the 1977 season , and the city went without a pro team until 1993 . The New Orleans Zephyrs came to Metairie by way of Denver , Colorado , in 1993 . With the arrival of the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball expansion team , the citys Denver Zephyrs were forced to relocate .",
      "Louisiana lawyer and business promoter Robert E . Couhig , Jr . led the effort to relocate the team to New Orleans . The Zephyr name was appropriate for New Orleans , too , as the Zephyr Roller Coaster was a popular ride at the Pontchartrain Beach amusement park ( which had closed in 1983 ) . The New Orleans Zephyrs remained in the American Association through 1997 . The circuit disbanded following the season , and they joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998 .",
      "The Zephyrs won the 1998 PCL championship and went on to win the Triple-A World Series against the Buffalo Bisons , 3\u20131 . The Zephyrs were also slated to participate in the 2001 championship series with the Tacoma Rainiers , but the playoffs were cancelled in the wake of the September 11 attacks , and the teams were named co-champions .",
      "The Zephyrs finished out the last portion of their home games for the 2005 Pacific Coast League season three days before Hurricane Katrina hit the City of New Orleans , and though Zephyr Field sustained moderate damage , the team was able to open the 2006 season at home , making them the first professional team in New Orleans to do so after the hurricane .",
      "On May 5\u20136 , 2006 , the Zephyrs and Nashville Sounds participated in a 24-inning game at Nashville , Tennessees Herschel Greer Stadium which was played over the course of two days and lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes . The game matched the longest game , in terms of innings played , in PCL history . The Zephyrs scored once in the eighth inning and once in the ninth , and the teams remained tied through 18 innings before curfew was called . New Orleans won , 5\u20134 , on the second day on a Wiki Gonz\u00e1lez RBI single . The Zephyrs set 12 franchise records , including striking out a league-record 29 times .",
      "In 2008 , the Zephyrs season ended three days early due to the approach of Hurricane Gustav . When it became apparent that Gustav would hit the Gulf Coast on September 1 , they cancelled their games of August 30 through September 1 .",
      "On September 22 , 2008 , the Zephyrs became the Triple-A affiliate of the Florida Marlins ( now the Miami Marlins ) . In October 2009 , the team unveiled a new logo with the letter Z set against a fleur-de-lis .",
      "The Zephyrs rebranded for the 2017 season . A name-the-team contest was held in search of a new team name to be accompanied by a new color scheme and logos by Brandiose . The seven finalist monikers were Baby Cakes , Crawfish , King Cakes , Night Owls , Poboys , Red Eyes , and Tailgators . On November 15 , the team unveiled Baby Cakes as the new team name and purple , green , and gold as the new team colors , as well as a unique promotion to promote the name : any child born in the state of Louisiana during 2017 was eligible for a lifetime pass to Baby Cakes games , and would be entered into a raffle wherein the winner would receive a full four-year tuition to a state college in Louisiana upon their 18th birthday in 2035 . As part of the rebrand , the teams stadium , Zephyr Field , was changed to Shrine on Airline .",
      "The name change was met with mixed reactions . Some fans found the new moniker and logos appealing , and the team reported increased merchandise sales after the announcement . Others expressed disappointment in the new name via social media , claiming it to be an unsuitable name for a sports team and that it did not accurately reflect local culture . At the time of the branding announcement , the team noted fan interest in retaining the Zephyrs moniker , but pointed out that the name had relocated from Denver to New Orleans and had no regional ties or significance other than the roller coaster at Pontchartrain Beach which closed in 1983 .",
      "On April 14 , 2017 , Baby Cakes pitchers Scott Copeland ( 7 IP ) , Hunter Cervenka ( 1 IP ) , and Brandon Cunniff ( 1 IP ) combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Iowa Cubs .",
      "On September 2 , 2019 , the PCL Triple-A New Orleans Baby Cakes played their final game ever as the Baby Cakes on the road against the Oklahoma City Dodgers in Oklahoma City with a 10-1 win over the Dodgers to cap off 27 years of Triple-A baseball in the Big Easy since the team relocated there in 1993 .",
      "The team relocated to Wichita , Kansas , in 2020 and re-branded as the Wichita Wind Surge . After the 2021 MiLB reorganization , the team was not invited back as a Triple-A affiliate and was instead invited to serve as a Double-A team . New Orleans hopes to bring a Double-A Southern League team to replace the PCL Triple-A franchise ."

      "Laurette A . J . Onkelinx ( born 2 October 1958 in Ougr\u00e9e ) is a Belgian politician from the Francophone Socialist Party . She was the Deputy Prime Minister \u2013 Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health in the Belgian federal government , i.e. , the Di Rupo Government , which took office on 6 December 2011 .",
      "Biography .",
      "Born to and Germaine Ali Bakir , of Kabyle origin , she graduated in law at the University of Li\u00e8ge after which she worked as a lawyer for 10 years . At the age of 30 she was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives .",
      "Her father , Gaston Onkelinx , originally a Dutch-speaking migrant from Flemish Limburg to francophone Wallonia , has long been mayor of Seraing ( near Li\u00e8ge ) and member of the House of Representatives ( 1974\u20131987 ) . Her grandfather , Maurice Onkelinx , was alderman and mayor of Jeuk in Limburg and lost his civil rights for some years after the 2nd world-war . Her older brother , Alain Onkelinx , has been a member of the Regional Parliament of Wallonia since September 2005 . She speaks French and Dutch .",
      "Controversy .",
      "When Turkish terrorist Fehriye Erdal was sentenced to four years imprisonment by a Bruges court on 28 February 2006 , it turned out that she had shaken off the Belgian secret service , which had the responsibility of following her since 23 February 2006 ( Erdal had been under house arrest since 2000 , and living in the same building as the DHKP-C secretariat ) . Both Laurette Onkelinx and Minister of the Interior Patrick Dewael have come under fire for this incident ; the Christian Democratic and Flemish party ( CD&V ) and Vlaams Belang demanded the resignation of both of them on 6 March 2006 .",
      "In July 2006 , Onkelinx came under heavy political fire again when one of Belgians most notorious criminals , Murat Kaplan , did not return from a weekend-leave , which she signed off . In August 2006 she came again under heavy fire when 28 prisoners managed to escape from a prison in Dendermonde . In September 2006 , it was reported that the criminal Victor Hoxha had returned to Belgium \u2013 he was deported earlier from Belgium in 2006 , and told not to return for ten years . Prime minister Guy Verhofstadt , of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats ( VLD ) , has now asked the minister to refrain from releasing any criminals prematurely in the coming three months , but she refuses this demand . This comes just before the government prepares its budget for the coming year , and the October municipal elections .",
      "CD&V and Vlaams Belang again had asked the resignation of the minister , but it is unknown how far the VLD will go in supporting the minister ( and accordingly , the current federal government ) . On 23 September , it was reported that another criminal did not return from day-leave . Tony Van Parys , of the CD&V party , called it incomprehensible that someone like Azzouzi [ criminal in question ] would get penitentiary leave . The cabinets crisis was averted the next week , when a deal was struck between the VLD and PS , allowing criminals only to be released on parole , in the next months , after consent by their victim ( or the victims family ) .",
      "On 6 October , two days before the Belgian municipal elections , Laurette Onkelinx was hit with a pie at an election event in Schaerbeek . The perpetrator was Benito Franscesconi , a 78-year-old man , who has a history of civil disobiedence . Franscesconi has made himself a civil party to many court cases in which he had no direct interest .",
      "First married to Abb\u00e8s Guenned , a Belgian of Moroccan descent , she divorced him in 1997\u20131998 , Morocco asked for his extradition , accusing him of drug trafficking ( Guenned was stopped on 31 July 1997 at the airport of Zaventem , while being in the possession of a diplomatic passport ) , a charge which has since been dropped . He was also arrested in Turkey but released after strong influence from the Belgian government . At that time , Onkelinx was presiding over the government of Belgiums French Community . Onkelinx then married barrister . Witnesses to this marriage were both their former husband and wife . In 2003 , Guenned became an adviser to Onkelinx cabinet , charged with the preparation of the election of the Belgian advisory Muslim council , and dealing with town management but , especially , with the communication between the cabinet and the Islamic associations .",
      "In 2009 , she criticized Pope Benedict XVI over his comments that condoms distribution without prior education only worsen the AIDS crisis .",
      "In 2014 , it was revealed that her Ministry hired the firm of her own husband , , as a legal consultant , for a cost of 245,000 euros .",
      "On 13 September 2017 Onkelincx announces not be a candidate for the 2019 elections .",
      "Political career .",
      "First elected to the Belgian House of Representatives in 1988 , she has held several ministerial posts without any interruption since 1992 :",

      "Olivier Bernard ( born 14 October 1979 ) is a French former footballer . He announced his retirement after leaving Newcastle United on 16 May 2007 . He is currently the owner and CEO of Durham City .",
      "Early life .",
      "Bernard was born in the 12th arrondissement of Paris and grew up in the south-east of the city . Both of his parents were born in Guadeloupe .",
      "He began to be involved with local gangs from the age of 9 , and credits football with turning him away from a life of crime .",
      "Club career .",
      "Olympique Lyonnais .",
      "Bernard joined the Lyon academy at the age of 13 , after being spotted while representing Seine-et-Marne in a youth cup final . He rejected a professional contract from Lyon , despite being required to under the French Professional Football Charter . He was initially required to pay compensation to the French club , but this was overturned by an eventual ruling of the European Court of Justice ten years later . This resulted in changes to the French youth transfer system .",
      "Newcastle United .",
      "Bernard joined on a free transfer from Lyon in late-August 2000 . He had an evolving career with the Magpies between 2000 and 2005 , even though he was at Darlington on loan in the 2000\u201301 season . He formed a strong left flank partnership with fellow Frenchman Laurent Robert , being a part of Bobby Robsons side , which finished fourth , third and fifth as well as reaching the last 16 of the Champions League and the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup . He was a regular starter at the beginning of the 2004\u201305 season , but Robson was sacked on 28 August 2004 and replaced by Graeme Souness , who made drastic changes at the club , cutting star players like Craig Bellamy and Laurent Robert .",
      "Southampton .",
      "After a dispute over contract negotiations , Bernard left Newcastle on 31 January 2005 to join Southampton on a five-month contract .",
      "When Southampton were relegated to the Championship in 2005 , Bernards contract expired and was not renewed by the club .",
      "Rangers .",
      "After leaving Southampton , Bernard signed a two-year deal with Rangers on 1 September 2005 , after turning down potential moves back to the Premier League with Birmingham City and Bolton Wanderers . He cited the prospect of playing in the Champions League once again was a driving force for his move .",
      "After just one season with Rangers , and only nine league appearances , he was released after being made surplus to requirements by new manager Paul Le Guen .",
      "Return to Newcastle United .",
      "Newcastle fans had mixed opinions when Bernard re-signed for them on 1 September 2006 after reneging on an agreement to join Leeds United .",
      "However , his second spell on Tyneside did not turn out as well as hoped , with Bernard struggling for fitness and a series of niggling injuries preventing him from making his second debut for Newcastle . The latest injury was reported to be a hip injury . He made numerous reserve team outings , and was an unused substitute in some UEFA Cup fixtures , including away to Palermo and Levadia Tallinn . He never made an appearance for Newcastle during his injury hampered spell .",
      "As a result of this , on 16 May 2007 it was announced that , following the appointment of Sam Allardyce as Newcastle boss Bernard , along with Titus Bramble , Oguchi Onyewu , Craig Moore , and Pavel Srn\u00ed\u010dek would not be playing for the side the following season having been released from their contracts .",
      "He trained with Toronto FC to keep his fitness up in June 2008 , mainly because he is friends with former Toronto midfielder Laurent Robert .",
      "Retirement .",
      "Bernard retired from football due to a hip injury . In a 2011 interview , he criticised manager Graeme Sounesss man management and blamed him for the death of his career . Bernards injury will require an operation eventually , but he is prolonging it despite the pain . He may never be able to run or have full mobility again- living with a limp for the rest of his life is almost a certainty . He now fights racism in football as a prominent memberShow Racism the Red Card and has recently appeared on Sky Sports News expressing his views on the Suarez/Evra dispute and stating his displeasure at the consequent actions of the Liverpool players .",
      "Durham City ownership .",
      "In December 2013 it was announced that Bernard had purchased non-league Durham City and become owner and chairman of the club . On buying the club , Bernard stated I want to make Durham one of the best feeder clubs in the north east . At the moment , I dont think the area develops enough youngsters . I want to raise the profile of the club and get links with Sunderland , Newcastle and Middlesbrough . Look at the England team , how many of them are from around here ? Ill do everything I can to get players to Durham and help develop them ."

      "Max Weber ( artist )",
      "Max Weber ( April 18 , 1881 \u2013 October 4 , 1961 ) was a Jewish-American painter and one of the first American Cubist painters who , in later life , turned to more figurative Jewish themes in his art . He is best known today for Chinese Restaurant ( 1915 ) , in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art , the finest canvas of his Cubist phase , in the words of art historian Avis Berman .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early years .",
      "Born in the Polish city of Bia\u0142ystok , then part of the Russian Empire , Weber emigrated to the United States and settled in Brooklyn with his Orthodox Jewish parents at the age of ten . He studied art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn under Arthur Wesley Dow . Dow was a fortunate early influence on Weber as he was an enlightened and vital teacher in a time of conservative art instruction , a man who was interested in new approaches to creating art . Dow had met Paul Gauguin in Pont-Aven , was a devoted student of Japanese art , and defended the advanced modernist painting and sculpture he saw at the Armory Show in New York in 1913 .",
      "In 1905 , after teaching in Virginia and Minnesota , Weber had saved enough money to travel to Europe , where he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris and acquainted himself with the work of such modernists as Henri Rousseau ( who became a good friend ) , Henri Matisse , Pablo Picasso , and other members of the School of Paris . His friends among fellow Americans included some equally adventurous young painters , such as Abraham Walkowitz , H . Lyman Sayen , and Patrick Henry Bruce . Avant-garde France in the years immediately before World War I was fertile and welcoming territory for Weber , then in his early twenties . He arrived in Paris in time to see a major C\u00e9zanne exhibition , meet the poet Guillaume Apollinaire , frequent Gertrude Steins salon , and enroll in classes in Matisses private Academie . Rousseau gave him some of his works ; others , Weber purchased . He was responsible for Rousseaus first exhibition in the United States .",
      "America .",
      "In 1909 he returned to New York and helped to introduce Cubism to America . He is now considered one of the most significant early American Cubists , but the reception his work received in New York at the time was profoundly discouraging . Critical response to his paintings in a 1911 show at the 291 gallery , run by Alfred Stieglitz , was an occasion for one of the most merciless critical whippings that any artist has received in America . The reviews were of an almost hysterical violence . He was attacked for his brutal , vulgar , and unnecessary art license . Even a critic who usually tried to be sympathetic to new art , James Gibbons Huneker , protested that the artists clever technique had left viewers with no real picture and made use of the adage , The operation was successful , but the patient died . As art historian Sam Hunter wrote , Webers wistful , tentative Cubism provided the philistine press with their first solid target prior to the Armory Show .",
      "Weber was sustained by the respect of some eminent peers , such as photographers Alvin Langdon Coburn and Clarence White , and museum director John Cotton Dana , who saw to it that Weber was the subject of a one-man exhibition at the Newark Museum in 1913 , the first modernist exhibition in an American museum . For a few years , Weber enjoyed a productive if rocky relationship with Stieglitz , and he published two essays in Stieglitzs journal Camera Work . ( He also wrote Cubist poems and published a book , Essays on Art , in 1916. ) So poor was Weber in these years that he camped out for some weeks in Stieglitzs gallery . Weber was also closely acquainted with Wilhelmina Weber Furlong and Thomas Furlong , whom he met at the Art Students League , where he taught from 1919 to 1921 and 1926 to 1927 . Weber died in Great Neck , New York in 1961 . He was the subject of a major retrospective at the Jewish Museum in 1982 .",
      "Weber evidently was a prickly personality even with his allies . He and Stieglitz had a falling-out , and Weber was not represented in the famous Armory Show because his friend , Arthur B . Davies , one of the shows organizers , had only allotted him space for two paintings . In a fit of pique at Davies , he withdrew entirely from the exhibition . Other artists in the Stieglitz circle kept their distance , especially after Weber told people that there were only three indisputably great modern painters : C\u00e9zanne , Rousseau , and himself . Almost without exception , they found him obnoxious : opinionated , rude , intolerant .",
      "Success .",
      "In time , Webers work found more adherents , including Alfred H . Barr , Jr. , the first director of the Museum of Modern Art . In 1930 , the Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective of his work , the first solo exhibition at that museum of an American artist . He was praised as a pioneer of modern art in America in a 1945 Life magazine article . In 1948 , Look magazine reported on a survey among art experts to determine the greatest living American artists ; Weber was rated second , behind only John Marin . He was the subject of a major traveling retrospective in 1949 . He became more popular in the 1940s and 1950s for his figurative work , often expressionist renderings of Jewish families , rabbis , and Talmudic scholars , than for the early modernist work he had abandoned circa 1920 and on which his current reputation is founded .",
      "Not everyone believed that Weber fulfilled his early potential as he became a more representational and expressionist painter post-World War I . Critic Hilton Kramer wrote of him that , in light of the remarkable beginning of his career , Weber proved instead to be one of the great disappointments of twentieth-century American art . Others however , because of his bold Cubist decade , hold him in the same high regard as other native modernists like John Marin , Arthur Dove , Marsden Hartley , and Charles Demuth .",
      "Poetry .",
      "While lecturing at the Clarence H . White School for Photography , Weber wrote his Cubist Poems that were to be published in 1914 .",
      "In 1926 , the artist released another collection entitled Primitives : Poems and Woodcuts . Weber designed the modernist-style binding for the book , as well as providing eleven woodcuts for the illustrations . First published by Spiral Press in a run of 350 copies , original editions are now rare .",

      "1 Hanover Square ( also known as India House , Hanover Bank Building , and New York Cotton Exchange Building ) is a commercial building on the southwestern edge of Hanover Square in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City . It was the site of the United States first cotton futures exchange , the New York Cotton Exchange .",
      "1 Hanover Square is composed of four originally separate structures . The main structure is a three-story brownstone building designed in the Italian Renaissance style and completed in 1854 . The brownstone contains the buildings main entrance facing Hanover Square . Adjoining the brownstone are three brick structures at 60\u201364 Stone Street , which date to 1836 and were built as commercial stores . The brick buildings are four stories tall but are the same height as the brownstone . Inside are maritime-themed spaces that are used by Harrys Bar , Ulysses Folk House , and the India House club .",
      "The brownstone initially served as the headquarters of the Hanover Bank , while other commercial tenants occupied the brick buildings . The New York Cotton Exchange , founded in 1870 , occupied the building from 1872 to 1885 . The building subsequently served as the headquarters of W.R . Grace and Company until the early 1910s . In 1914 , the structures were purchased by the India House , a private club for gentlemen involved in foreign commerce , which continues to occupy the building . Over the years , various architects have made renovations to 1 Hanover Square , with the three Stone Street stores being gradually combined with the brownstone structure between the 1870s and 1910s . Restaurants have also been housed in various portions of 1 Hanover Square throughout its history .",
      "1 Hanover Squares design , especially in regard to its later use as the India House clubhouse , has received critical acclaim . The building was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission ( LPC ) in 1965 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) in 1972 . The building also became a National Historic Landmark in 1977 . It is a contributing property to the Stone Street Historic District , which was designated by the LPC in 1996 and by the NRHP in 1999 .",
      "Site .",
      "1 Hanover Square is in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City . It occupies the northeastern side of a block bounded by Stone Street to the northwest , Hanover Square and William Street to the northeast , Pearl Street to the southeast , and Coenties Slip to the southwest . The building carries the alternate addresses 2 Hanover Square , 60\u201366 Stone Street , and 95\u2013105 Pearl Street . 1 Hanover Square contains frontage of on Hanover Square , on Stone Street , and on Pearl Street . The building is near 1 William Street to the northwest and the British Garden at Hanover Square to the northeast .",
      "The site was historically part of New Amsterdam , a 17th-century Dutch colonial settlement in modern-day Lower Manhattan ; the buildings site was acquired by Richard Smith in the 1640s . By the next decade , the southern portion of the lot was sold to Evert Duyckingh ( also Duyckinck ) , who developed a house on the site . The northern portion was given to Abraham Martens Clock , who also developed a house on his site ; after 1673 , town official Nicholas Bayard bought the western end of Clocks land and built a house there . There were numerous buildings on the site by 1812 , occupied by various dwellings and businesses . These structures were all destroyed in the Great Fire of 1835 , which leveled a large portion of the neighborhood .",
      "Design .",
      "1 Hanover Square is composed of four formerly separate buildings . The main structure , completed in 1851 , is a three-story masonry structure atop a raised basement , built out of brownstone in the Italian Renaissance style . Although Lower Manhattan formerly contained many Italianate commercial structures , 1 Hanover Square is the only remaining such structure . The building extends southwest to 60\u201364 Stone Street ( also known as 95\u2013101 Pearl Street ) , a set of Greek Revival commercial structures completed in 1836 . These three structures are made of brick and are four stories tall . The additional commercial structures are the same height as the main brownstone structure . The architects for all of these structures are not known , although Richard F . Carman may have been involved in the design of the brownstone .",
      "The lot comprising 1 Hanover Square was formerly six separate parts . Each of the four-story brick structures at 60 , 62 , and 64 Stone Street comprise one part extending the depth of the block to 95\u201397 , 99 , and 101 Pearl Street respectively . The main structure is composed of a three-story brownstone section on Hanover Square , a three-story brick section on 66 Stone Street , and a three-story brownstone section on 103 Pearl Street . All of the constituent structures occupy the same land lot . The building as a whole is roughly rectangular but has longer frontage on Pearl and Stone Streets .",
      "1 Hanover Square serves as the headquarters of the India House club and contains restaurant and bar space . While the building has had numerous occupants in its history , it was particularly known for being the first headquarters of the New York Cotton Exchange , founded in 1870 . The exchange was the second cotton futures exchange in the world behind the International Cotton Association , as well as the first such exchange in the United States .",
      "Facade .",
      "The main brownstone structure has its primary frontage on Hanover Square . There are eight vertical bays facing Hanover Square , of which the center two contain the main entrance . The Pearl and Stone Street facades incorporate the additional structures at 60\u201364 Stone Street . The Pearl Street facade contains four brownstone bays , similar to those on Hanover Square , as well as eleven brick-clad bays . The Stone Street facade has two brownstone bays and twelve brick bays . There is a flat roof atop the brownstone structure and slightly sloped roofs atop the brick structures .",
      "The brownstone structure sits atop a slightly raised basement with rectangular sash windows and a facade of rusticated brownstone blocks . The Hanover Square facade is set behind a recessed area with an iron railing . One stair on each side of the main entrance leads down to the recessed area and the basement . The main entrance is through a brownstone stoop leading up from the street to double doors . The covered entrance portico is flanked by two Corinthian-style columns on either side and is topped by a balustrade . The tall windows on the first floor are each flanked by paneled pilasters , which are topped by console brackets that support segmentally arched pediments . Second-floor windows are smaller , set beneath gabled pediments . The third floor windows are smaller still , with simpler rectangular surrounds . The facade is crowned by a cornice supported by modillions ; it was once topped by a parapet with a balustrade .",
      "The brick sections are largely four stories tall . The three easternmost bays at 66 Stone Street are three stories tall , similar to the main brownstone section . Along the brick sections of the building , the first story on both sides contains stone piers supporting a stone lintel . The upper stories contain rectangular windows with granite piers and lintels . Numerous alterations have been made to the first-story facades on either side , and there are various types of windows on the upper stories . There are ornate iron fire escapes on both sides of the buildings brick sections . In addition , an iron basement hatch is at 95\u201397 Pearl Street , and there is a stoop leading to the basement at 99 Pearl Street .",
      "Interior .",
      "Inside the main entrance is a vestibule measuring . A set of doors leads to a hallway , which connected to the India House library on the right and the India Houses lobby , waiting area , reception area , and coat room on the left . At the end of the hall is a central stairway that splits into two perpendicular flights . The first floor contained the onetime trading floor of the Cotton Exchange , which extended across nearly the whole footprint of the brownstone . The brick structures to the west contain offices , bars , and dining areas . Ulysses Folk House is within the ground floor space at 95 Pearl Street and the adjacent 53 Pearl Street .",
      "The upper floors of the main structure contain plaster walls , as well as several fireplaces with wood or marble mantelpieces . The second floor includes three dining rooms arranged around an opening that overlooks the hallway on the first floor . The third floor includes four dining rooms . The westernmost structure at 60 Stone Street contains a ballroom , the Marine Room , on its upper floor . The Marine Room was built in 1924 to designs by W . A . Delano and is connected to the second-floor landing of the buildings central stairway . The room is decorated with shells , fish , and seahorses atop its columns and frieze ; it is also lit by lamps shaped like shells and spheres . On the third floor , there is a wooden model of the merchant vessel Gladiator under an oval skylight .",
      "The modern interior generally includes nautical decoration and Oriental art . The maritime decorations include paintings , engravings , and models of ships . The maritime artifacts include a pair of cannons flanking the first-floor staircase banisters and a bell from the luxury ship SS Leviathan . In Harrys Steakhouse and Restaurant , which occupies the buildings basement , are murals with images of drunken monks making wine .",
      "History .",
      "Initial occupants .",
      "In 1836 , the year after the Great Fire , the 60\u201366 Stone Street and 95\u2013105 Pearl Street lots were redeveloped with four-story brick commercial structures . Some of the occupants of the buildings by 1839 included merchant Edward Gould , hardware vendor F . T . Luqueer , and three or more dry-goods companies . The lots on 105 Pearl Street and 66 Stone Street , facing Hanover Square , were combined by 1851 . Richard F . Carman sold the Hanover Square lots for $25,000 to Hanover Bank ( later Manufacturers Hanover Corporation ) , a bank that had been incorporated that year .",
      "The three-story brownstone for Hanover Bank was developed at 1 Hanover Square and completed by 1854 . The four-story brick facade at 66 Stone Street was reconfigured so its fenestration , or window arrangement , matched that of the brownstone . The Hanover Bank did not extend into any of the commercial structures at 95\u2013101 Pearl Street or 60\u201364 Stone Street , nor did it initially occupy 103 Pearl Street . Maps indicate that two additional brownstone bays at 103 Pearl Street were added sometime between 1862 and 1879 to designs by an unidentified architect . In addition , early prints show that the structure resembled a pair of brownstone townhouses with two entrance stoops . According to the India House club , part of 1 Hanover Square was also occupied by Robert L . Maitland , while an 1869 directory listed Meadows T . Nicholson & Son as another occupant of the brownstone . The Hanover Bank moved to Nassau and Pine Streets in 1872 or 1877 . Sometime before its relocation , the Hanover Bank had sold the building to Maitland .",
      "New York Cotton Exchange .",
      "The New York Cotton Exchange , founded in 1870 , was initially housed in rented quarters nearby at 142 Pearl Street . The Cotton acquired the building from Maitland in February 1871 at a cost of $115,000 . To accommodate the exchange , the building was renovated starting in June 1871 . The architect Ebenezer L . Roberts reconfigured the interior and added the present main doorway with a clock face and a Cotton Exchange name identification sign . In addition , a dome was installed atop the roof . The Cotton Exchange quarters were officially opened on May 4 , 1872 ; the exchange occupied the first floor and rented out sixteen offices on the other two floors . According to an exchange history , the transactions increased rapidly in size and importance after the relocation .",
      "The Cotton Exchanges space was extended into the commercial building at 64 Stone Street/101 Pearl Street in 1876 . A 16-year-old errand boy was killed the next year after falling from the top floor to the basement . The Third Avenue elevated train line on Pearl Street opened in 1878 , overshadowing 1 Hanover Square . By the end of the decade , the Cotton Exchange decided to expand its quarters . Finding it impossible to purchase the brick rowhouses adjoining 1 Hanover Square , the exchange decided instead to look for sites for a new structure . The Cotton Exchange ultimately built a new headquarters on an adjacent block bounded by Hanover Square , Beaver Street , and William Street . The Cotton Exchange officially moved to its new building on April 30 , 1885 .",
      "W . R . Grace and Company .",
      "1 Hanover Square became the headquarters of W . R . Grace and Company . Shortly after W . R . Grace and Company had moved to the building , Julius Kastner designed and constructed the fire escapes on Stone and Pearl Streets . By the 1890s , images show the sign above the entrance was changed to Old Cotton Exchange . George Ehret acquired the brownstone structure and adjacent brick structures in three separate transactions in the 1880s and 1890s . In 1899 , 1 Hanover Square was merged with the commercial building at 62 Stone Street/99 Pearl Street , which previously had been owned by the estate of Manley B . Boardman .",
      "At the beginning of the 20th century , 1 Hanover Square contained a Haitian consulate and the Stuetzle Brothers liquor sellers . Sometime between 1899 and 1914 , the final brick commercial building at 60 Stone Street/95\u201397 Pearl Street was combined with 1 Hanover Square . W . R . Grace and Company had moved out by 1912 or 1913 , opening a new headquarters on the block immediately to the southeast .",
      "India House .",
      "The India House , a private club for gentlemen involved in foreign commerce , was founded by James A . Farrell and Willard Straight in July 1914 . It was so named because , at the time , merchants of the Western world were focused on trade with the Far East . Over the years , its members came to include politicians such as U.S . President Franklin D . Roosevelt ; U.S . secretary of commerce Harry Hopkins ; U.S . treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. ; U.S . secretaries of state George C . Marshall , James F . Byrnes and Cyrus Vance ; New York governor W . Averell Harriman ; U.S . Senator Henry Cabot Lodge ; and mayors John P . OBrien and William Adams Delano .",
      "1910s to 1960s .",
      "The club obtained a ten-year lease on 1 Hanover Square and an option to buy it at any point during the lease . To accommodate the clubhouse , George Ehret renovated the structure , removing the parapet atop the brownstone and adding a light-colored coating to the facade . In addition , maritime artifacts were moved to the clubhouse . The collection included ship models and Chinese art donated by Straight , as well as models , engravings , and paintings of ship donated by Farrell . The club moved into the building on November 16 , 1914 .",
      "In 1915 , plans were filed with the Manhattan Bureau of Buildings for a 20-story office building on the site . The filing was a preparatory measure rather than an indication that the site was to be redeveloped . The building was sold in January 1917 for $750,000 , with J . Reuben Clark reported as the buyer . 1 Hanover Square was subsequently bought by Straight in 1918 , and his widow Dorothy Payne Whitney continued to hold the property after his death the same year . In 1921 , India House Inc . decided to purchase 1 Hanover Square for $650,000 . William Adams Delano and Chester Holmes Aldrich further renovated 1 Hanover Square between 1924 and 1925 . During this renovation , a skylighted third-floor meeting room was added with nautical decoration . As part of the renovation , the basement and cellar were also altered or expanded . The buildings basement restaurant was damaged in a 1925 fire ; engine crews had gotten confused while simultaneously trying to fight another fire across the street . The club installed soundproofing in the buildings dining rooms in 1937 .",
      "The Third Avenue Elevated was closed in 1950 and subsequently removed . The lines demolition allowed both greater sunlight and quieter meetings ; according to the India Clubs president , the passing trains were loud and had shaken the foundations of the building . In 1951 , shortly after the elevated lines removal , the India House club decided to renovate the exterior of 1 Hanover Square to plans by Nicholson & Galloway . The sheet metal balustrade was removed from the cornice during this time . Members of the India House proposed a maritime-themed park on Hanover Square , which was dedicated that November . By the 1960s , the basement contained a German-American tavern called Hanover Square .",
      "1970s to present .",
      "In 1972 , Harry Poulakakos and his wife Adrienne opened Harrys Bar within the basement of 1 Hanover Square . By the 1980s , the bar typically served hundreds of patrons during lunch and dinner , and it had private telephone lines connecting to nearby brokerage houses . Following the financial crisis of 1987 , the Broad Street Club merged with the India House and moved to 1 Hanover Square . Through the early 1990s , Harrys was popular among the areas bankers , brokers , and traders . The Poulalakos son Peter opened Bayards Restaurant on the upper stories in 1998 , named for Nicholas Bayard , one of the sites 17th-century occupants . At the time , the India House still met at 1 Hanover Square during the day , so Bayards only operated at night . Meanwhile , India House had sold off much of its collection of maritime artwork by then . The India House Foundation , created in 1999 , unsuccessfully attempted to save the collection .",
      "Harrys survived the September 11 attacks in 2001 , as did Bayards . After Adrienne Poulakakos died in August 2003 , and amid a general decline in patronage , Harrys suddenly closed that November , but Bayards and the India Club continued to operate . Around that time , the India House began to restore 1 Hanover Squares facade , which had long been covered with brown stucco . The project was completed in 2005 and received the New York Landmarks Conservancys Lucy G . Moses Preservation Award . Harry and Peter Poulakakos opened Harrys Steakhouse and Restaurant in May 2006 . Also in the mid-2000s , Peter Poulakakos opened and co-operated Ulysses Folk House and Adriennes Pizza Bar within 1 Hanover Square and the adjacent buildings on Pearl and Stone Streets . Bayards had been closed by the 2010s .",
      "Critical reception and landmark status .",
      "The main structure was described by the AIA Guide to New York City as having unfluted Corinthian columns and pedimented windows [ that ] give an understated enrichment to the dour brownstone . After the India Club moved into 1 Hanover Square , a reporter for The New York Times said in 1929 that the quiet dignity of the nineteenth century architecture [ ... ] furnishes a sharp contrast with the massive towers of banks and commercial structures in the Wall Street district nearby . The architect Alexander Trowbridge characterized the building in 1926 as among the citys most attractive clubs , while Antiques magazine called the interior of the India Club a kind of collectors paradise in 1938 . By the 1960s , it was described in the New York Daily News as a well-preserved structure that contrasts sharply with many of its dilapidated neighbors . A Times reporter wrote in 2001 that the India Club building evokes the heyday of Manhattans waterfront despite being one block inland .",
      "1 Hanover Squares exterior was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission ( LPC ) as an official city landmark on December 22 , 1965 . It was one of the first landmarks to be designated by the LPC in Manhattan , as well as the first luncheon club in Lower Manhattan to be designated as a landmark . The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was re-added to the NRHP as a National Historic Landmark in 1977 . 1 Hanover Square is also part of the Stone Street Historic District , which was designated as a New York City historic district in 1996 and as an NRHP district in 1999 .",
      "1 Hanover Square and its occupants have also been depicted in works of popular culture . The building was used in the 2001 film Kate & Leopold as Leopolds family home . Harrys Bar in the basement was depicted as a traders favorite hangout in the 1987 novel The Bonfire of the Vanities . The art and artifacts at the India House were the subject of a 2014 book by historian Margaret Stocker ."

      "Andr\u00e9 Schembri ( born 27 May 1986 ) is a Maltese former footballer who played as a forward .",
      "Schembri started his professional career with local clubs Hibernians and Marsaxlokk , leading the latter to their first league title in the 2006\u201307 season . Between the summers of 2007 and 2009 he spent season-long loans with German lower-tier clubs Eintracht Braunschweig and Carl Zeiss Jena . After a blighted six months with Austria K\u00e4rnten , he joined Hungarian side Ferencv\u00e1ros where he established himself as first choice ending the season as the clubs top scorer with 17 goals in all competitions .",
      "In the summer of 2011 , Schembri joined Olympiacos Volou however after a few games the club was demoted to the fourth-tier of Greek football following a match-fixing scandal . As a result , Schembri joined Panionios . After completing the 2011\u201312 season , Schembri was signed by Cypriot club Omonia . With them he slowly established himself in the forward line finishing his second season as the leagues second highest goalscorer with 17 goals . After a short stint with German club FSV Frankfurt , he returned to Omonia in December 2014 .",
      "With interest from foreign clubs , Portuguese side Boavista signed Schembri . Although initially making the first eleven , the arrival of a new manager midway through the season led to him being dropped to a substitute role . With lack of opportunities , Schembri returned to Cyprus , joining Apollon Limassol in the summer of 2017 . He quickly became a prominent figure , scoring four goals in six qualifying matches as he helped the club make it through to the group stages of the UEFA Europa League . In this same competition he also became the first Maltese to score in the proper rounds of a UEFA competition . In August 2017 , he won his first trophy outside his home country as Apollon Limassol triumphed in the Cypriot Super Cup , with Schembri also scoring the winning goal .",
      "At the international level , he represented Malta at youth levels , before making his senior debut on 4 June 2006 against Japan . His first goals came in the historic 2\u20131 win over Hungary , scoring twice as Malta won their first competitive game in 13 years . Regarded as one of the best Maltese football exports , he amassed 94 appearances for the national team , the eighth-highest number of appearances at the time of his retirement in October 2018 .",
      "Club career .",
      "Early career .",
      "Schembri started out as a trainee with Hibernians making his first team debut in the 2002\u201303 season . The following season , he scored his first goal in the 2\u20131 win over Balzan Youths on 31 August 2003 . He made his debut in a European competition on 19 June 2004 , in the Intertoto Cup first round match against Slaven Belupo . Hibernians won the match 2\u20131 with Schembri scoring the winner . Midway through the 2004\u201305 season , there were disagreements between Schembri and the club , and with a possible transfer in sight Sliema Wanderers and Marsaxlokk became interested in his acquisition . In the end , Marsaxlokk finalised the transfer and Schembri joined the club on 29 January 2005 . His first goal came in the 2\u20131 win over Msida Saint-Joseph played on 5 February . His first full season at the club ended with 11 goals to his name , a feat he repeated in the 2006\u201307 season as Marsaxlokk were crowned league champions for the first time . During the league-winning campaign , Schembri formed an attacking partnership with Daniel Bogdanovi\u0107 who between them scored 42 out of Marsaxlokks 74 goals .",
      "German stint .",
      "In the summer of 2007 , with interest from foreign clubs including OFI Crete , Schembri joined Eintracht Braunschweig on a season-long loan . Playing in the Regionalliga Nord , the third-tier in German football , Schembri made his debut on 31 July in the 2\u20133 defeat against VfL Wolfsburg II , coming on as a second-half substitute for Lars Fuchs . His first goals came on the tenth matchday , scoring a hat-trick against Energie Cottbus II on 21 September in a 5\u20130 win . For the final league game of the season , Schembri was suspended by the club for selecting to play in a friendly match for the Maltese national team instead of the promotion decider against Borussia Dortmund II . He finished the season with nine goals , the last being against VfB L\u00fcbeck , ending as the clubs third top-scorer for the season as Eintracht Braunschweig qualified to the newly-formed 3 . Liga .",
      "Schembris stay in Germany was extended to a further year as in June 2008 he joined 3 . Liga side Carl Zeiss Jena on another loan . His first game was on 26 July , when he came in as an 84th-minute substitute for Salvatore Amirante during a 2\u20132 draw against Jahn Regensburg in a league match . His first goal at the club arrived in the first round of the DFB-Pokal , scoring the opener in the 2\u20131 win over 1 . FC Kaiserslautern . He found the net again in the round of 16 tie against Bundesliga side Schalke which ended in a 1\u20134 defeat . He finished the season by scoring two goals in the last two matchdays , including the equaliser against Sandhausen , which guaranteed Carl Zeiss Jenas stay in the 3 . Liga .",
      "After his contract expired with Marsaxlokk , Schembri joined Austria K\u00e4rnten on a two-year deal on 19 June 2009 . Amid the clubs financial problems and a disappointing start to the season which saw them sitting at the bottom of the table , Schembri was one of few players who was allowed to be released in January 2010 . His only goal for the Austrian club came in a 2\u20133 defeat against Kapfenberger SV on 26 July .",
      "Ferencv\u00e1ros .",
      "Ferencv\u00e1ros signed Schembri in February 2010 , teaming up with compatriot Justin Haber who joined the Hungarian club from Sheffield United . He made his debut on 12 March in the 0\u20130 draw against Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za Spartacus . He quickly became a key figure in Ferencv\u00e1ros attack and was rewarded with a new contract at the end of the season . With the arrival of new manager L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Prukner , Schembri was moved as the main forward for Fradi and rose to prominence during the 2010\u201311 season , scoring his first goal on 1 September in a 3\u20130 win over Gy\u0151r . He scored his first hat-trick against Vasas in a 3\u20131 win , becoming the first Maltese footballer to score a hat-trick in a foreign top-tier league . Two months later , on 20 November , he netted another hat-trick against Lombard P\u00e1pa in the 5\u20130 away win . He added to his tally braces against MTK Budapest and Zalaegerszegi , to finish off the season as the clubs highest goalscorer , and the leagues second highest , with 16 goals . Ferencv\u00e1ros finished third as they qualified to the first qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League , making a return to European football after a six-year absence .",
      "Olympiakos Volou .",
      "Schembris contract with Ferencv\u00e1ros ended at the end of the 2010\u201311 season , and despite concrete interest from Serie A side Chievo , he joined Olympiacos Volou on 7 July 2011 . He made his debut a week later , on 14 July , as a last-minute substitute against Rad in the second qualifying round of the Europa League , scoring his first goal for the club in the third qualifying round match played on 28 July , a 3\u20130 win over Differdange . On the same day , the Greek Super Leagues disciplinary committee announced the demotion of Olympiakos Volou and Kavala to the Beta Ethniki , the second tier in Greek football , for their involvement in a match-fixing scandal . As the club failed to obtain a license , they were relegated to the Delta Ethniki , the fourth tier in Greek football , as well as being excluded from the current Europa League campaign and given a three-year ban from any European competition by UEFA . As a result of this , the Greek Federation allowed the rescinding of players contracts and to join other clubs outside of the transfer window .",
      "Panionios .",
      "Following the rescinding of his contract with Olympiakos Volou and his preference to stay in Greece , Schembri joined Panionios , signing a one-year contract on 30 September 2011 . He made his debut in the sixth league matchday on 16 October , in the 0\u20130 draw against PAS Giannina , scoring his first goal in the 1\u20132 defeat against Atromitos on 29 October . In the match against Aris on 27 November , he scored once and assisted on the winning goal in the 2\u20131 win , being praised by the media for his performance . At the end of the season , which he concluded with five goals to his name , Panionios and Schembri failed to reach an agreement on his salary and the contract was not renewed .",
      "Omonia .",
      "On 20 August 2012 , Cypriot club Omonia signed Schembri on a two-year deal . Before signing for Omonia there was interest from Sampdoria which were ready to make a deal had they not won promotion to Serie A . The first game played was the home win over Ayia Napa on 2 September , scoring on his first start for the club against Enosis on 27 October in a 2\u20130 win . He ended the season scoring eight goals as Omonia finished third and gained access to the UEFA Europa League second qualifying round . The following season , despite the early exit from the UEFA competition , Schembri further solidified his place and scored his first goal of the season and assisted the third goal in the 4\u20130 win over Enosis on 14 September 2013 . He wrapped up the first round of the championship with 11 goals , including braces against Doxa and Anorthosis Famagusta , as Omonia qualified to the Championship round . With six additional goals in this round , Schembri took his season tally to 17 goals , ending as the leagues second highest goalscorer .",
      "During the summer of 2014 , with the chance of joining a higher-level league , Schembri joined 2 . Bundesliga side FSV Frankfurt . His return in Germany and teaming up with Benno M\u00f6hlmann , his former head coach at Eintracht Braunschweig , proved to be a disappointing one as it lasted only six months . With lack of space in the first eleven and a single goal against Hoffenheim in the DFB-Pokal , Schembri rescinded his contract in December . In the same month he agreed to re-join Omonia on an 18-month contract .",
      "In the first game back with Omonia he scored a goal in the 2\u20130 win over Ethnikos Achna on 10 January 2015 . He was instrumental in leading Omonia to the semi-finals of the Cypriot Cup , scoring six goals in six appearances including a hat-trick against Karmiotissa . Omonia qualified to compete in the UEFA Europa League first qualifying round and on 9 July , Schembri scored the winner against Dinamo Batumi which gave Omonia access to the successive round . His goals contribution alongside that of striker Cillian Sheridan helped Omonia push to the top of the table , with Schembri being employed most of the time as the only forward . He finished the league season with 15 goals , although Omonia lost the Cypriot Cup final against Apollon Limassol .",
      "Boavista .",
      "With Schembris contract coming up at the end of the season , talks between the two parties for an extension were held mid-season amid interest from other Cypriot and Asian clubs . In the end , on 16 June 2016 , Primeira Liga club Boavista officially announced Schembris transfer . In an interview with newspaper Record , Schembri described how he refused other offers with higher salaries in order to fulfill his desire to move to a better league . He made his debut in the opening day of the 2016\u201317 season in the 2\u20130 win over Arouca , before being replaced by Diogo Caldas . Schembri scored his first goal , the opener , in the 2\u20132 draw against Chaves played on 28 August . During the first half of the season he was a mainstay in Boavistas starting eleven under both Erwin S\u00e1nchez and his replacement Miguel Leal , even scoring the third goal in a 3\u20133 draw against Benfica in a match where Boavista were 3\u20130 up after 25 minutes . With the arrival of Peruvian striker Iv\u00e1n Bulos during the January transfer window he lost his place in the starting eleven , mostly being introduced in the games from the substitutes bench . In the last game of the season played at home against champions-elect Benfica , Schembri scored the momentary 2\u20130 goal as Benfica relayed back to level the game in injury time . With lack of space in the first team by the end of the season and with possibly not figuring in manager Miguel Leals plans for the following season , Schembri and Boavista came to a mutual agreement to rescind his contract ending his stay at the Porto-based club .",
      "Apollon Limassol .",
      "On 13 June 2017 , Schembri signed with Apollon Limassol , returning to Cyprus after his earlier stint with Omonia . In his first game played on 13 July , he scored the first in a 3\u20130 win over Zaria B\u0103l\u021bi in the UEFA Europa League second qualifying round . He scored his second goal in as many games in the second leg match played the following week , as Apollon made it through to the third qualifying round . Schembris form in the Europa League resumed as in the following rounds he struck important goals against Aberdeen ( in a 3\u20132 aggregate win ) and Midtjylland ( in a 4\u20133 aggregate win ) with Apollon qualifying to the group stage . He ended the qualifying round scoring four goals in six matches and became the second Maltese player to feature in the UEFA Europa League after Luke Dimech . In the Cypriot Super Cup final against APOEL on 9 August , Schembri was introduced as a second-half replacement for Antonio Jakoli\u0161 and three minutes from time he scored the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win for Apollon , their fourth trophy in history . In the group stage match against Atalanta played on 19 October , Schembri scored the temporary equaliser in an eventual 1\u20133 defeat , although he did not celebrate due to that the death of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia . With this goal he became the first Maltese player to score in the proper rounds of a UEFA competition . His first season back in Cyprus ended with him scoring 14 goals , including a goal in the Cypriot Cup final defeat against AEK Larnaca .",
      "Near the end of the 2018\u201319 season , Schembri announced that he would leave Apollon at the end of the league campaign . His last game was the 1\u20132 defeat against Nea Salamis played on 22 May , in which he scored Apollons only goal .",
      "Chennaiyin F.C. .",
      "On 27 August 2019 , Schembri signed a one-year contract with Indian Super League ( ISL ) side Chennaiyin , becoming the first Maltese player to play in India . He made his debut in the first league game of the season , starting in a 3\u20130 defeat against Goa . His first goal came on 25 November 2019 , scoring the opener after coming off the bench in a 2\u20131 win over Hyderabad , to mark Chennaiyins first league win of the season . In the same game , he also assisted Nerijus Valskis for the winner in the final minutes of the match . With four additional goals , he helped Chennaiyin finish fourth and qualifying for the Indian Super League playoffs . On 9 March 2020 , Schembri announced his retirement from professional football , with his last game being the ISL final against ATK on 14 March .",
      "International career .",
      "Schembri was capped at various youth levels for Malta , starting from the under-14s up to the under-21s . His first game in a UEFA competition was on 5 March 2002 against Armenia , a qualifier for the 2002 UEFA Under-17 Championship , won 1\u20130 .",
      "On 4 June 2006 , Schembri made his debut with the Maltese national team in a friendly against Japan , which ended in a 0\u20131 defeat . His first goals arrived in his fifth cap , in a UEFA Euro qualifier match against Hungary played at Ta Qalis National Stadium on 11 October 2006 . Schembri gave Malta the lead after 14 minutes when following Michael Mifsuds shot which hit the crossbar , he slotted the ball in the net . Hungary equalised five minutes later from a S\u00e1ndor Torghelle header , however Malta retook the lead six minutes in the second half when Gilbert Agius played a through-ball to Schembri who rounded G\u00e1bor Kir\u00e1ly and slid the ball in an empty net . The match ended in a 2\u20131 win , with this marking Maltas first competitive win in 13 years , their first win in a UEFA European Championship match in 24 years and their first home win in a competitive match in 31 years . Schembri became a regular figure in Maltas starting eleven and in the same qualifier competition he scored his third international goal , against Turkey , in the fixture played on 8 September 2007 . After both teams finished the first half at 1\u20131 , Schembri received a ball from Mifsud and put it past goalkeeper Hakan Ar\u0131kan . Turkey equalised a couple of minutes later from Servet \u00c7etin , as the match ended in a 2\u20132 scoreline .",
      "Schembri captained Malta for the first time on 25 March 2015 , in a friendly against Georgia ; he ultimately served as captain 16 times . After the 0\u20132 defeat in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against England , played on 8 October 2016 , Schembri criticised the Malta Football Association ( MFA ) , the governing body of football in Malta , for the lack of progress done in Maltese football and the lack of initiative in the youth football setups . His stance was supported by many , with the associations president acknowledging the disappointing results in the last 20 years , although he asserted that the MFA had been working in sending Maltese youth to trials abroad . For the following match against Lithuania on 11 October , Schembri was removed as captain and replaced by Michael Mifsud , with the insistence that the decision was a tactical one . In October 2018 , he reiterated his stance on the stagnation of Maltese football and the lack of concrete ideas by the governing body to improve it , although he praised the MFAs initiative in assisting youth footballers to foreign leagues .",
      "On 13 November 2018 , Schembri announced that he would be retiring from international football following the end of the UEFA Nations League campaign , citing his wish to prolong his club career and to give an opportunity to the younger generation . His last match was on 20 November in the 1\u20131 draw against the Faroe Islands , finishing off with his 94th appearance .",
      "Style of play .",
      "Schembris versatility in forward roles saw him deployed in numerous positions , including an attacking midfielder , a second striker or even a pure striker , as well as playing on the wings .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Schembri is the son of Eric Schembri and grandson of Salvinu Schembri , both former footballers and Maltese internationals . He married Clarissa Ellul , a television presenter , on 3 June 2016 at St . Pauls Church in Rabat . In June 2018 , he published an autobiographical book , Andr\u00e9 Schembri \u2013 10 snin nilg\u0127ab fl-Ewropa ( Andr\u00e9 Schembri \u2013 10 years playing in Europe ) , the first one by a Maltese footballer , detailing his struggles and successes during his career . Since 2017 , Schembri and Apollon Limassol have been supporting Dr . Klown , a Maltese non-governmental organisation which provide clown doctor services .",

      "Guy Aldred",
      "Guy Alfred Aldred ( often Guy A . Aldred ; 5 November 1886 \u2013 16 October 1963 ) was a British anarchist communist and a prominent member of the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation ( APCF ) . He founded the Bakunin Press publishing house and edited five Glasgow-based anarchist periodicals : The Herald of Revolt , The Spur , The Commune , The Council , and The Word , where he worked closely with Ethel MacDonald and his later partner Jenny Patrick .",
      "Early life .",
      "Aldred was born in Clerkenwell , London . His father was a 22-year-old lieutenant in the Royal Navy , and his mother was Ada Caroline Holdsworth , a 19-year-old parasol maker . Although Ada was socially unacceptable to the young naval officer , he married her shortly before Guys birth . After the wedding , he left her at the church to return to his mother . Guy Fawkes night , 5 November , gave Guy his forename . Guy was brought up in the home of Ada\u2019s father , Charles Holdsworth , a Victorian radical . He attended the Iron Infants School in Farringdon Road , later moving to the Hugh Middleton Higher Grade School , where he was presented to the Prince of Wales because he was the youngest pupil . One of his fellow pupils was the son of Hermann Jung , the Swiss watchmaker and one-time activist in the First International . His first adventures in propaganda were with the Anti-Nicotine League , the Band of Hope , and the total abstinence movement , and he remained an abstainer in these respects all his life .",
      "His grandfather , an Anglican , encouraged him to attend the church of St Anne and St Agnes , where he took communion in 1894 . However , he soon developed a critical attitude to the church , even though he was close to his cousin , a curate at Holloway .",
      "At the age of 15 ( 1902 ) , he was made aware of his London provincialism when Madho Singh II , the Maharaja of Jaipur , visited the city . He became fascinated by the newspaper accounts of the Maharaja moving around with his travelling god :",
      "Later that year he gained a reputation as a Boy Preacher , printing and handing out his own leaflets , which were often received with ridicule and disdain . He found employment as an office boy with the National Press Agency in Whitefriars House , where he was promoted to sub-editor . Working with an evangelist named McMasters , he co-founded the Christian Social Mission , opening shortly after his 16th birthday as the Holloway Boy Preacher . His non-conformist approach aroused concern following his first sermon .",
      "After contacting Charles Voysey , Guy was eventually granted an audience on 20 December 1902 . The 74-year-old well-to-do Voysey was surprised to be confronted with a coarse-dressed 16-year-old working class boy . After careful preliminaries on the part of Voysey , the meeting lasted three hours . Their friendship was to continue until Voysey\u2019s death in 1912 .",
      "In January 1903 the Reverend George Martin , an Anglican priest , visited Guy with one of his leaflets , asking to meet the Holloway Boy Preacher . Martin worked in London\u2019s worst slums , and Guy joined him in his work with London\u2019s poorest . His friendship with Martin lasted six years and influenced Guy strongly . He soon gave his last sermon from the pulpit and left the Christian Social Mission .",
      "Agnosticism .",
      "Guy became a speaker at the Institute of Theism , but soon felt it was time to set up his own organisation . In 1904 he founded the Theistic Mission , which met every Sunday . With a considerable , though sometimes boisterous , crowd , Guy was gaining a reputation as a forceful young orator . He was also shifting towards atheism . By August , the meeting banner was changed to read The Clerkenwell Freethought Mission . Meetings often generated extreme hostility . On one occasion the crowd charged the platform , knocking Guy to the ground and beating him . Police intervention put an end to the meeting . Around this time he became interested in The Agnostic Journal and became friendly with its editor , Saladin , a Scotsman . It was at the Journal\u2019s office that he met another Scotsman , John Morrison Davidson , and Guy became more interested in Scottish affairs .",
      "Indian Sedition Trial , 1907 .",
      "The Indian Sociologist was an Indian nationalist newspaper edited by Shyamji Krishnavarma . When Krishnavarma left London for Paris , fearing repression by the authorities , the printing of the newspaper was first taken over by Arthur Fletcher Horsley . However , he was arrested and tried for printing the May , June and July issues . ( He was tried and sentenced on the same day as Madan Lal Dhingra , who was convicted of the assassination of Sir William Hutt Curzon Wyllie ) . At Horseleys prominent trial the Lord Chief Justice , Lord Alverstone , indicated that anyone printing that sort of material would be liable for prosecution . Nevertheless , Aldred , as an advocate of the free press , published it , bearing his own name . The police obtained a warrant and seized 396 copies of the issue . At the trial the prosecution was led by the Attorney General , Sir William Robson , at the Central Criminal Court . Robson highlighted parts of TIS which Aldred had himself written , particularly focussing on a passage which touched on the execution of Dhingra :",
      "Aldred also remarked that the Sepoy Mutiny , or Indian Mutiny , would be described as The Indian War of Independence . Aldred received a sentence of twelve months hard labour . His involvement with The Indian Sociologist brought him into contact with Har Dayal , who combined anarchism with his Indian Nationalism , based on his view of ancient Aryan culture and Buddhism .",
      "Socialism and anarchism .",
      "Aldred joined the Social Democratic Federation , but left in 1906 . He was a political conscientious objector during the First World War and also a founder of the Glasgow Anarchist Group . He initiated the Communist Propaganda Groups , in support of the October Revolution , which subsequently became a component of the Communist League in 1919 . Following its collapse , he founded the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation ( APCF ) in 1921 , and gradually moved towards opposing the Soviet Union . His links with left communists across Europe brought him close to council communism .",
      "In 1932 he split with the APCF and later founded the Workers Open Forum , which eventually became the United Socialist Movement . During World War II the USM worked with people from across the political spectrum to oppose military action , in a form of Popular Front , and came to advocate World Government . After Joseph Stalins death , Aldred became increasingly supportive of the Soviet Union .",
      "Free love .",
      "Aldred worked closely with his partner Rose Witcop ( 9 April 1890 \u2013 4 July 1932 ) , a pioneer of birth control and sister of Milly Witkop ( who was , in turn , partner of anarchist Rudolf Rocker ) .",
      "Together they published an edition of Margaret Sangers Family Limitation , an action which saw them denounced by a London magistrate for indiscriminate publication and , despite expert testimony from a consultant to Guys Hospital and evidence at the appeal that the book had only been sold to those aged over twenty-one , the stock was ordered to be destroyed . Their case had been strongly supported by Dora Russell who , with her husband Bertrand Russell and John Maynard Keynes , paid the legal costs of the appeal .",
      "Aldred and Witcop had a son , Annesley , in 1909 . Although they were drifting apart by the time Aldred settled permanently in Glasgow in 1922 , finally parting in 1924 , they had a legal marriage on 2 February 1926 , when it seemed possible Witcop might be deported for her continuing work on family planning .",
      "Death and legacy .",
      "After initially refusing hospital treatment for a heart condition , Guy Aldred died , almost penniless , in the Western Infirmary , Glasgow , on 16 October 1963 aged 76 , leaving his body to Glasgow Universitys Department of Anatomy . His remains were cremated at the Maryhill Crematorium , Glasgow on 4 May 1964 .",
      "Aldreds long-time associate and literary executor , John Taylor Caldwell , produced a biography Come Dungeons Dark : The Life and Times of Guy Aldred , Glasgow Anarchist and ensured that Aldreds work was collated and preserved on microfilm . His personal papers were deposited in the Bailies Library , Glasgow , now held in the Mitchell Library . He was survived by his son , Annesley .",

      "Inter Milan",
      "Football Club Internazionale Milano , commonly referred to as Internazionale ( ) or simply Inter , and known as Inter Milan outside Italy , is an Italian professional football club based in Milan , Lombardy . Inter is the only Italian club never to have been relegated from the top flight of Italian football .",
      "Founded in 1908 following a schism within the Milan Cricket and Football Club ( now A.C . Milan ) , Inter won its first championship in 1910 . Since its formation , the club has won 31 domestic trophies , including 19 league titles , 7 Coppa Italia and 5 Supercoppa Italiana . From 2006 to 2010 , the club won five successive league titles , equalling the all-time record at that time . They have won the Champions League three times : two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965 and then another in 2010 . Their latest win completed an unprecedented Italian seasonal treble , with Inter winning the Coppa Italia and the Scudetto the same year . The club has also won three UEFA Cups , two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup .",
      "Inters home games are played at the San Siro stadium , which they share with city rivals A.C . Milan . The stadium is the largest in Italian football with a capacity of 75,923 . They have long-standing rivalries with A.C . Milan , with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina , and Juventus , with whom they contest the Derby dItalia ; their rivalry with the former is one of the most followed derbies in football . , Inter has the highest home game attendance in Italy and the sixth highest attendance in Europe . The club is one of the most valuable in Italian and world football .",
      "History .",
      "Foundation and early years ( 1908\u20131960 ) .",
      "The club was founded on 9 March 1908 as Football Club Internazionale , following the schism with the Milan Cricket and Football Club ( now A.C . Milan ) . The name of the club derives from the wish of its founding members to accept foreign players without limits as well as Italians .",
      "The club won its first championship in 1910 and its second in 1920 . The captain and coach of the first championship winning team was Virgilio Fossati , who was later killed in battle while serving in the Italian army during World War I . In 1922 , Inter was at risk of relegation to the second division , but they remained in the top league after winning two play-offs .",
      "Six years later , during the Fascist era , the club was forced to merge with the Unione Sportiva Milanese and was renamed Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Ambrosiana . During the 1928\u201329 season , the team wore white jerseys with a red cross emblazoned on it ; the jerseys design was inspired by the flag and coat of arms of the city of Milan . In 1929 , the new club chairman Oreste Simonotti changed the clubs name to Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana and restored the previous black-and-blue jerseys , however supporters continued to call the team Inter , and in 1931 new chairman Pozzani caved in to shareholder pressure and changed the name to Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana-Inter .",
      "Their first Coppa Italia ( Italian Cup ) was won in 1938\u201339 , led by the iconic Giuseppe Meazza , after whom the San Siro stadium is officially named . A fifth championship followed in 1940 , despite Meazza incurring an injury . After the end of World War II the club regained its original name , winning its sixth championship in 1953 and its seventh in 1954 .",
      "Grande Inter ( 1960\u20131967 ) .",
      "In 1960 , manager Helenio Herrera joined Inter from Barcelona , bringing with him his midfield general Luis Su\u00e1rez , who won the European Footballer of the Year in the same year for his role in Barcelonas La Liga/Fairs Cup double . He would transform Inter into one of the greatest teams in Europe . He modified a 5\u20133\u20132 tactic known as the Verrou ( door bolt ) which created greater flexibility for counterattacks . The catenaccio system was invented by an Austrian coach , Karl Rappan . Rappans original system was implemented with four fixed defenders , playing a strict man-to-man marking system , plus a playmaker in the middle of the field who plays the ball together with two midfield wings . Herrera would modify it by adding a fifth defender , the sweeper or libero behind the two centre backs . The sweeper or libero who acted as the free man would deal with any attackers who went through the two centre backs . Inter finished third in the Serie A in his first season , second the next year and first in his third season . Then followed a back-to-back European Cup victory in 1964 and 1965 , earning him the title il Mago ( the Wizard ) . The core of Herreras team were the attacking fullbacks Tarcisio Burgnich and Giacinto Facchetti , Armando Picchi the sweeper , Su\u00e1rez the playmaker , Jair the winger , Mario Corso the left midfielder , and Sandro Mazzola , who played on the inside-right .",
      "In 1964 , Inter reached the European Cup Final by beating Borussia Dortmund in the semi-final and Partizan in the quarter-final . In the final , they met Real Madrid , a team that had reached seven out of the nine finals to date . Mazzola scored two goals in a 3\u20131 victory , and then the team won the Intercontinental Cup against Independiente . A year later , Inter repeated the feat by beating two-time winner Benfica in the final held at home , from a Jair goal , and then again beat Independiente in the Intercontinental Cup .",
      "In 1967 , with Jair gone and Su\u00e1rez injured , Inter lost the European Cup Final 2\u20131 to Celtic . During that year the club changed its name to Football Club Internazionale Milano .",
      "Subsequent achievements ( 1967\u20131991 ) .",
      "Following the golden era of the 1960s , Inter managed to win their eleventh league title in 1971 and their twelfth in 1980 . Inter were defeated for the second time in five years in the final of the European Cup , going down 0\u20132 to Johan Cruyffs Ajax in 1972 . During the 1970s and the 1980s , Inter also added two to its Coppa Italia tally , in 1977\u201378 and 1981\u201382 .",
      "Led by the German duo of Andreas Brehme and Lothar Matth\u00e4us , and Argentine Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz , Inter captured the 1989 Serie A championship . Inter were unable to defend their title despite adding fellow German J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann to the squad and winning their first Supercoppa Italiana at the start of the season .",
      "Mixed fortunes ( 1991\u20132004 ) .",
      "The 1990s was a period of disappointment . While their great rivals Milan and Juventus were achieving success both domestically and in Europe , Inter were left behind , with repeated mediocre results in the domestic league standings , their worst coming in 1993\u201394 when they finished just one point out of the relegation zone . Nevertheless , they achieved some European success with three UEFA Cup victories in 1991 , 1994 and 1998 .",
      "With Massimo Morattis takeover from Ernesto Pellegrini in 1995 , Inter twice broke the world record transfer fee in this period ( \u00a319.5 million for Ronaldo from Barcelona in 1997 and \u00a331 million for Christian Vieri from Lazio two years later ) . However , the 1990s remained the only decade in Inters history in which they did not win a single Serie A championship . For Inter fans , it was difficult to find who in particular was to blame for the troubled times and this led to some icy relations between them and the chairman , the managers and even some individual players .",
      "Moratti later became a target of the fans , especially when he sacked the much-loved coach Luigi Simoni after only a few games into the 1998\u201399 season , having just received the Italian manager of the year award for 1998 the day before being dismissed . That season , Inter failed to qualify for any European competition for the first time in almost ten years , finishing in eighth place .",
      "The following season , Moratti appointed former Juventus manager Marcello Lippi , and signed players such as Angelo Peruzzi and Laurent Blanc together with other former Juventus players Vieri and Vladimir Jugovi\u0107 . The team came close to their first domestic success since 1989 when they reached the Coppa Italia final only to be defeated by Lazio .",
      "Inters misfortunes continued the following season , losing the 2000 Supercoppa Italiana match against Lazio 4\u20133 after initially taking the lead through new signing Robbie Keane . They were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the Champions League by Swedish club Helsingborgs IF , with \u00c1lvaro Recoba missing a crucial late penalty . Lippi was sacked after only a single game of the new season following Inters first ever Serie A defeat to Reggina . Marco Tardelli , chosen to replace Lippi , failed to improve results , and is remembered by Inter fans as the manager that lost 6\u20130 in the city derby against Milan . Other members of the Inter family during this period that suffered were the likes of Vieri and Fabio Cannavaro , both of whom had their restaurants in Milan vandalised after defeats to the Rossoneri .",
      "In 2002 , not only did Inter manage to make it to the UEFA Cup semi-finals , but were also only 45 minutes away from capturing the Scudetto when they needed to maintain their one-goal advantage away to Lazio . Inter were 2\u20131 up after only 24 minutes . Lazio equalised during first half injury time and then scored two more goals in the second half to clinch victory that eventually saw Juventus win the championship . The next season , Inter finished as league runners-up and also managed to make it to the 2002\u201303 Champions League semi-finals against Milan , losing on the away goals rule .",
      "Comeback and unprecedented treble ( 2004\u20132011 ) .",
      "On 8 July 2004 , Inter appointed former Lazio coach Roberto Mancini as its new head coach . In his first season , the team collected 72 points from 18 wins , 18 draws and only two losses , as well as winning the Coppa Italia and later the Supercoppa Italiana . On 11 May 2006 , Inter retained their Coppa Italia title once again after defeating Roma with a 4\u20131 aggregate victory ( a 1\u20131 scoreline in Rome and a 3\u20131 win at the San Siro ) .",
      "Inter were awarded the 2005\u201306 Serie A championship retrospectively after title-winning Juventus was relegated and points were stripped from Milan due to the match fixing scandal that year . During the following season , Inter went on a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in Serie A , starting on 25 September 2006 with a 4\u20131 home victory over Livorno , and ending on 28 February 2007 , after a 1\u20131 draw at home to Udinese . On 22 April 2007 , Inter won their second consecutive Scudetto\u2014and first on the field since 1989\u2014when they defeated Siena 2\u20131 at Stadio Artemio Franchi . Italian World Cup-winning defender Marco Materazzi scored both goals .",
      "Inter started the 2007\u201308 season with the goal of winning both Serie A and Champions League . The team started well in the league , topping the table from the first round of matches , and also managed to qualify for the Champions League knockout stage . However , a late collapse , leading to a 2\u20130 defeat with ten men away to Liverpool on 19 February in the Champions League , threw into question manager Roberto Mancinis future at Inter while domestic form took a sharp turn of fortune with the team failing to win in the three following Serie A games . After being eliminated by Liverpool in the Champions League , Mancini announced his intention to leave his job immediately only to change his mind the following day . On the final day of the 2007\u201308 Serie A season , Inter played Parma away , and two goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 sealed their third consecutive championship . Mancini , however , was sacked soon after due to his previous announcement to leave the club .",
      "On 2 June 2008 , Inter appointed former Porto and Chelsea boss Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as new head coach . In his first season , the Nerazzurri won a Suppercoppa Italiana and a fourth consecutive title , though falling in the Champions League in the first knockout round for a third-straight year , losing to eventual finalist Manchester United . In winning the league title Inter became the first club in the last 60 years to win the title for the fourth consecutive time and joined Torino and Juventus as the only clubs to accomplish this feat , as well as being the first club based outside Turin .",
      "Inter won the 2009\u201310 Champions League , defeating reigning champions Barcelona in the semi-final before beating Bayern Munich 2\u20130 in the final with two goals from Diego Milito . Inter also won the 2009\u201310 Serie A title by two points over Roma , and the 2010 Coppa Italia by defeating the same side 1\u20130 in the final . This made Inter the first Italian team to win the treble . At the end of the season , Mourinho left the club to manage Real Madrid ; he was replaced by Rafael Ben\u00edtez .",
      "On 21 August 2010 , Inter defeated Roma 3\u20131 and won the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana , their fourth trophy of the year . In December 2010 , they claimed the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time after a 3\u20130 win against TP Mazembe in the final . However , after this win , on 23 December 2010 , due to their declining performance in Serie A , the team fired Ben\u00edtez . He was replaced by Leonardo the following day .",
      "Leonardo started with 30 points from 12 games , with an average of 2.5 points per game , better than his predecessors Ben\u00edtez and Mourinho . On 6 March 2011 , Leonardo set a new Italian Serie A record by collecting 33 points in 13 games ; the previous record was 32 points in 13 games made by Fabio Capello in the 2004\u201305 season . Leonardo led the club to the quarter-finals of the Champions League before losing to Schalke 04 , and lead them to Coppa Italia title . At the end of the season , however , he resigned and was followed by new managers Gian Piero Gasperini , Claudio Ranieri and Andrea Stramaccioni , all hired during the following season .",
      "Changes in ownership ( 2011\u20132019 ) .",
      "On 1 August 2012 , the club announced that Moratti was to sell a minority interest of the club to a Chinese consortium led by Kenneth Huang . On the same day , Inter announced an agreement was formed with China Railway Construction Corporation Limited for a new stadium project , however , the deal with the Chinese eventually collapsed . The 2012\u201313 season was the worst in recent club history with Inter finishing ninth in Serie A and failing to qualify for any European competitions . Walter Mazzarri was appointed to replace Stramaccioni as the manager for 2013\u201314 season on 24 May 2013 , having ended his tenure at Napoli . He guided the club to fifth in Serie A and to 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League qualification .",
      "On 15 October 2013 , an Indonesian consortium ( International Sports Capital HK Ltd. ) led by Erick Thohir , Handy Soetedjo and Rosan Roeslani , signed an agreement to acquire 70% of Inter shares from Internazionale Holding S.r.l . Immediately after the deal , Morattis Internazionale Holding S.r.l . still retained 29.5% of the shares of FC Internazionale Milano S.p.A . After the deal , the shares of Inter was owned by a chain of holding companies , namely International Sports Capital S.p.A . of Italy ( for 70% stake ) , International Sports Capital HK Limited and Asian Sports Ventures HK Limited of Hong Kong . Asian Sports Ventures HK Limited , itself another intermediate holding company , was owned by Nusantara Sports Ventures HK Limited ( 60% stake , a company owned by Thohir ) , Alke Sports Investment HK Limited ( 20% stake ) and Aksis Sports Capital HK Limited ( 20% stake ) .",
      "Thohir , whom also co-owned Major League Soccer ( MLS ) club D.C . United and Indonesia Super League ( ISL ) club Persib Bandung , announced on 2 December 2013 that Inter and D.C . United had formed strategic partnership . During the Thohir era the club began to modify its financial structure from one reliant on continual owner investment to a more self sustain business model although the club still breached UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in 2015 . The club was fined and received squad reduction in UEFA competitions , with additional penalties suspended in the probation period . During this time , Roberto Mancini returned as the club manager on 14 November 2014 , with Inter finishing 8th . Inter finished 2015\u20132016 season fourth , failing to return to Champions League .",
      "On 6 June 2016 , Suning Holdings Group ( via a Luxembourg-based subsidiary Great Horizon S.\u00e1 r.l. ) a company owned by Zhang Jindong , co-founder and chairman of Suning Commerce Group , acquired a majority stake of Inter from Thohirs consortium International Sports Capital S.p.A . and from Moratti familys remaining shares in Internazionale Holding S.r.l . According to various filings , the total investment from Suning was \u20ac270 million . The deal was approved by an extraordinary general meeting on 28 June 2016 , from which Suning Holdings Group had acquired a 68.55% stake in the club .",
      "The first season of new ownership , however , started with poor performance in pre-season friendlies . On 8 August 2016 , Inter parted company with head coach Roberto Mancini by mutual consent over disagreements regarding the clubs direction . He was replaced by Frank de Boer who was sacked on 1 November 2016 after leading Inter to a 4W\u20132D\u20135L record in 11 Serie A games as head coach . The successor , Stefano Pioli , didnt save the team from getting the worst group result in UEFA competitions in the clubs history . Despite an eight-game winning streak , he and the club parted away before seasons end when it became clear they would finish outside the leagues top three for the sixth consecutive season . On 9 June 2017 , former Roma coach Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Inter manager , signing a two-year contract , and eleven months later Inter clinched a UEFA Champions League group stage spot after going six years without Champions League participation thanks to a 3\u20132 victory against Lazio in the final game of 2017\u201318 Serie A . Due to this success , in August the club extended the contract with Spalletti to 2021 .",
      "On 26 October 2018 , Steven Zhang was appointed as new president of the club . On 25 January 2019 , the club officially announced that LionRock Capital from Hong Kong reached an agreement with International Sports Capital HK Limited , in order to acquire its 31.05% shares in Inter and to become the clubs new minority shareholder . After the 2018\u201319 Serie A season , despite Inter finishing 4th , Spaletti was sacked .",
      "Recent history ( 2019\u2013present ) .",
      "On 31 May 2019 , Inter appointed former Juventus and Italian manager Antonio Conte as their new coach , signing a three-year deal . In September 2019 , Steven Zhang was elected to the board of the European Club Association . In the 2019\u201320 Serie A , Inter Milan finished as runner-up as they won 2\u20130 against Atalanta on the last matchday . They also reached the 2020 UEFA Europa League Final , ultimately losing 3\u20132 to Sevilla .",
      "Following Atalantas draw against Sassuolo on 2 May 2021 , Internazionale were confirmed as champions for the first time in eleven years , ending Juventus run of nine consecutive titles .",
      "Colours and badge .",
      "One of the founders of Inter , a painter named Giorgio Muggiani , was responsible for the design of the first Inter logo in 1908 . The first design incorporated the letters FCIM in the centre of a series of circles that formed the badge of the club . The basic elements of the design have remained constant even as finer details have been modified over the years . Starting at the 1999\u20132000 season , the original club crest was reduced in size , to give place for the addition of the clubs name and foundation year at the upper and lower part of the logo respectively .",
      "In 2007 , the logo was returned to the pre-1999\u20132000 era . It was given a more modern look with a smaller Scudetto star and lighter color scheme . This version was used until July 2014 , when the club decided to undertake a rebranding . The most significant difference between the current and the previous logo is the omission of the star from other media except match kits .",
      "Since its founding in 1908 , Inter have almost always worn black and blue stripes , earning them the nickname Nerazzurri . According to the tradition , the colours were adopted to represent the nocturnal sky : in fact , the club was established on the night of 9 March , at 23:30 ; moreover , blue was chosen by Giorgio Muggiani because he considered it to be the opposite colour to red , worn by the Milan Cricket and Football Club rivals .",
      "During the 1928\u201329 season , however , Inter were forced to abandon their black and blue uniforms . In 1928 , Inters name and philosophy made the ruling Fascist Party uneasy ; as a result , during the same year the 20-year-old club was merged with Unione Sportiva Milanese : the new club was named Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Ambrosiana after the patron saint of Milan . The flag of Milan ( the red cross on white background ) replaced the traditional black and blue . In 1929 the black-and-blue jerseys were restored , and after World War II , when the Fascists had fallen from power , the club reverted to their original name . In 2008 , Inter celebrated their centenary with a red cross on their away shirt . The cross is reminiscent of the flag of their city , and they continue to use the pattern on their third kit . In 2014 , the club adopted a predominantly black home kit with thin blue pinstripes before returning to a more traditional design the following season .",
      "Animals are often used to represent football clubs in Italy \u2013 the grass snake , called Biscione , represents Inter . The snake is an important symbol for the city of Milan , appearing often in Milanese heraldry as a coiled viper with a man in its jaws . The symbol is present on the coat of arms of the House of Sforza ( which ruled over Italy from Milan during the Renaissance period ) , the city of Milan , the historical Duchy of Milan ( a 400-year state of the Holy Roman Empire ) and Insubria ( a historical region the city of Milan falls within ) . For the 2010\u201311 season , Inters away kit featured the serpent .",
      "Stadium .",
      "The teams stadium is the 75,923 seat San Siro , officially known as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented both Milan and Inter . The more commonly used name , San Siro , is the name of the district where it is located . San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926 , when it was privately built by funding from Milans chairman at the time , Piero Pirelli . Construction was performed by 120 workers , and took 13 and a half months to complete . The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935 , and since 1947 it has been shared with Inter , when they were accepted as joint tenant .",
      "The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926 , when Inter beat Milan 6\u20133 in a friendly match . Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926 , losing 1\u20132 to Sampierdarenese . From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators , the stadium has undergone several major renovations , most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup when its capacity was set to 85,700 , all covered with a polycarbonate roof . In the summer of 2008 , its capacity was reduced to 80,018 to meet the new standards set by UEFA .",
      "Based on the English model for stadiums , San Siro is specifically designed for football matches , as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A . It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches owing to the closeness of the stands to the pitch . The frequent use of flares by supporters contributes to the atmosphere , but the practice has occasionally also caused problems .",
      "Supporters and rivalries .",
      "Inter is one of the most supported clubs in Italy , according to an August 2007 research by Italian newspaper La Repubblica . Historically , the largest section of Inter fans from the city of Milan were the middle-class bourgeoisie Milanese , while Milan fans were typically working-class .",
      "The traditional ultras group of Inter is Boys San ; they hold a significant place in the history of the ultras scene in general due to the fact that they are one of the oldest , being founded in 1969 . Politically , the ultras of Inter are usually considered right-wing and they have good relationships with the Lazio ultras . As well as the main group of Boys San , there are four more significant groups : Viking , Irriducibili , Ultras , and Brianza Alcoolica .",
      "Inters most vocal fans are known to gather in the Curva Nord , or north curve of the San Siro . This longstanding tradition has led to the Curva Nord being synonymous with the clubs most die-hard supporters , who unfurl banners and wave flags in support of their team .",
      "Inter have several rivalries , two of which are highly significant in Italian football ; firstly , they participate in the intracity Derby della Madonnina with Milan ; the rivalry has existed ever since Inter splintered off from Milan in 1908 . The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary , whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the citys main attractions . The match usually creates a lively atmosphere , with numerous ( often humorous or offensive ) banners unfolded before the match . Flares are commonly present , but they also led to the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004\u201305 Champions League quarter-final matchup between Milan and Inter on 12 April after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan keeper Dida on the shoulder .",
      "The other most significant rivalry is with Juventus ; matches between the two clubs are known as the Derby dItalia . Up until the 2006 Italian football scandal , which saw Juventus relegated , the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A . In the 2000s , Inter developed a rivalry with Roma , who finished as runners-up to Inter in all but one of Inters five Scudetto-winning seasons between 2005\u201306 and 2009\u201310 . The two sides have also contested in five Coppa Italia finals and four Supercoppa Italiana finals since 2006 . Other clubs , like Atalanta and Napoli , are also considered amongst their rivals . Their supporters collectively go by Interisti , or Nerazzurri .",
      "Honours .",
      "Inter have won 31 domestic trophies , including the league 19 times , the Coppa Italia seven and the Supercoppa Italiana five . From 2006 to 2010 , the club won five successive league titles , equalling the all-time record before 2017 , when Juventus won the sixth successive league title . They have won the Champions League three times : two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965 and then another in 2010 ; the last completed an unprecedented Italian treble with the Coppa Italia and the Scudetto . The club has also won three UEFA Cups , two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup .",
      "Inter has never been relegated from the top flight of Italian football in its entire existence . It is the sole club to have competed in Serie A and its predecessors in every season . The Nerrazurri currently have the longest unbroken run in the top flight leagues of any club on the Continent , 106 seasons , and among European clubs , only five British clubs have longer current spells in the top flight .",
      "Club statistics and records .",
      "Javier Zanetti holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Inter , with 858 official games played in total and 618 in Serie A .",
      "Giuseppe Meazza is Inters all-time top goalscorer , with 284 goals in 408 games . Behind him , in second place , is Alessandro Altobelli with 209 goals in 466 games , and Roberto Boninsegna in third place , with 171 goals over 281 games .",
      "Helenio Herrera had the longest reign as Inter coach , with nine years ( eight consecutive ) in charge , and is the most successful coach in Inter history with three Scudetti , two European Cups , and two Intercontinental Cup wins . Jos\u00e9 Mourinho , who was appointed on 2 June 2008 , completed his first season in Italy by winning the Serie A title and the Supercoppa Italiana ; in his second season he won the first treble in Italian history : the Serie A , Coppa Italia and the UEFA Champions League .",

The number was retired on 8 September 2006 , four days after Facchetti had died from cancer aged 64 . The last player to wear the number 3 shirt was Argentinian center back Nicol\u00e1s Burdisso , who took on the number 16 shirt for the rest of the season .",
      "4 \u2013 Javier Zanetti , defensive midfielder , played 858 games for Inter between 1995 and his retirement in the summer of 2014 . Club chairman Erick Thohir confirmed that Zanettis number 4 was to be retired out of respect .",

      "Corporate .",
      "FC Internazionale Milano S.p.A . was described as one of the financial black-holes among the Italian clubs , which was heavily dependent on the financial contribution from the owner Massimo Moratti . In June 2006 , the shirt sponsor and the minority shareholder of the club , Pirelli , sold 15.26% shares of the club to Moratti family , for \u20ac13.5 million . The tyre manufacturer retained 4.2% . However , due to several capital increases of Inter , such as a reversed merger with an intermediate holding company , Inter Capital S.r.l . in 2006 , which held 89% shares of Inter and \u20ac70 million capitals at that time , or issues new shares for \u20ac70.8 million in June 2007 , \u20ac99.9 million in December 2007 , \u20ac86.6 million in 2008 , \u20ac70 million in 2009 , \u20ac40 million in 2010 and 2011 , \u20ac35 million in 2012 or allowing Thoir subscribed \u20ac75 million new shares of Inter in 2013 , Pirelli became the third largest shareholders of just 0.5% , . Inter had yet another recapitalization that was reserved for Suning Holdings Group in 2016 . In the prospectus of Pirellis second IPO in 2017 , the company also revealed that the value of the remaining shares of Inter that was owned by Pirelli , was write-off to zero in 2016 financial year . Inter also received direct capital contribution from the shareholders to cover loss which was excluded from issuing shares in the past . ( )",
      "Right before the takeover of Thohir , the consolidated balance sheets of Internazionale Holding S.r.l . showed the whole companies group had a bank debt of \u20ac157 million , including the bank debt of a subsidiary Inter Brand Srl , as well as the club itself , to Istituto per il Credito Sportivo ( ICS ) , for \u20ac15.674 million on the balance sheet at end of 2012\u201313 financial year . In 2006 Inter sold its brand to the new subsidiary , Inter Brand S.r.l. , a special purpose entity with a shares capital of \u20ac40 million , for \u20ac158 million ( the deal made Internazionale make a net loss of just \u20ac31 million in a separate financial statement ) . At the same time the subsidiary secured a \u20ac120 million loan from Banca Antonveneta , which would be repaid in installments until 30 June 2016 ; La Repubblica described the deal as doping . In September 2011 Inter secured a loan from ICS by factoring the sponsorship of Pirelli of 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 season , for \u20ac24.8 million , in an interest rate of 3 months Euribor + 1.95% spread . In June 2014 new Inter Group secured \u20ac230 million loan from Goldman Sachs and UniCredit at a new interest rate of 3 months Euribor + 5.5% spread , as well as setting up a new subsidiary to be the debt carrier : Inter Media and Communication S.r.l. . \u20ac200 million of which would be utilized in debt refinancing of the group . The \u20ac230million loan , \u20ac1 million ( plus interests ) would be due on 30 June 2015 , \u20ac45 million ( plus interests ) would be repaid in 15 installments from 30 September 2015 to 31 March 2019 , as well as \u20ac184 million ( plus interests ) would be due on 30 June 2019 . In ownership side , the Hong Kong-based International Sports Capital HK Limited , had pledged the shares of Italy-based International Sports Capital S.p.A . ( the direct holding company of Inter ) to CPPIB Credit Investments for \u20ac170 million in 2015 , at an interest rate of 8% p.a ( due March 2018 ) to 15% p.a . ( due March 2020 ) . ISC repaid the notes on 1 July 2016 after they sold part of the shares of Inter to Suning Holdings Group . However , in the late 2016 the shares of ISC S.p.A . was pledged again by ISC HK to private equity funds of OCP Asia for US$80 million . In December 2017 , the club also refinanced its debt of \u20ac300 million , by issuing corporate bond to the market , via Goldman Sachs as the bookkeeper , for an interest rate of 4.875% p.a .",
      "Considering revenue alone , Inter surpassed city rivals in Deloitte Football Money League for the first time , in the 2008\u201309 season , to rank in 9th place , one place behind Juventus in 8th place , with Milan in 10th place . In the 2009\u201310 season , Inter remained in 9th place , surpassing Juventus ( 10th ) but Milan re-took the leading role as the 7th . Inter became the 8th in 2010\u201311 , but was still one place behind Milan . Since 2011 , Inter fell to 11th in 2011\u201312 , 15th in 2012\u201313 , 17th in 2013\u201314 , 19th in 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316 season . In 2016\u201317 season , Inter was ranked 15th in the Money League .",
      "In 2010 Football Money League ( 2008\u201309 season ) , the normalized revenue of \u20ac196.5 million were divided up between matchday ( 14% , \u20ac28.2 million ) , broadcasting ( 59% , \u20ac115.7 million , +7% , +\u20ac8 million ) and commercial ( 27% , \u20ac52.6 million , +43% ) . Kit sponsors Nike and Pirelli contributed \u20ac18.1 million and \u20ac9.3 million respectively to commercial revenues , while broadcasting revenues were boosted \u20ac1.6 million ( 6% ) by Champions League distribution . Deloitte expressed the idea that issues in Italian football , particularly matchday revenue issues were holding Inter back compared to other European giants , and developing their own stadia would result in Serie A clubs being more competitive on the world stage .",
      "In 2009\u201310 season the revenue of Inter was boosted by the sales of Ibrahimovi\u0107 , the treble and the release clause of coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho . According to the normalized figures by Deloitte in their 2011 Football Money League , in 2009\u201310 season , the revenue had increased \u20ac28.3 million ( 14% ) to \u20ac224.8 million . The ratio of matchday , broadcasting and commercial in the adjusted figures was 17%:62%:21% .",
      "For the 2010\u201311 season , Serie A clubs started negotiating club TV rights collectively rather than individually . This was predicted to result in lower broadcasting revenues for big clubs such as Juventus and Inter , with smaller clubs gaining from the loss . Eventually the result included an extraordinary income of \u20ac13 million from RAI . In 2012 Football Money League ( 2010\u201311 season ) , the normalized revenue was \u20ac211.4 million . The ratio of matchday , broadcasting and commercial in the adjusted figures was 16%:58%:26% .",
      "However , combining revenue and cost , in the 2006\u201307 season they had a net loss of \u20ac206 million ( \u20ac112 million extraordinary basis , due to the abolition of non-standard accounting practice of the special amortization fund ) , followed by a net loss of \u20ac148 million in the 2007\u201308 season , a net loss of \u20ac154 million in 2008\u201309 season , a net loss of \u20ac69 million in the 2009\u201310 season , a net loss of \u20ac87 million in the 2010\u201311 season , a net loss of \u20ac77 million in the 2011\u201312 season , a net loss of \u20ac80 million in 2012\u201313 season and a net profit of \u20ac33 million in 2013\u201314 season , due to special income from the establishment of subsidiary Inter Media and Communication . All aforementioned figures were in separate financial statement . Figures from consolidated financial statement were announced since 2014\u201315 season , which were net losses of \u20ac140.4 million ( 2014\u201315 ) , \u20ac59.6 million ( 2015\u201316 season , before 2017 restatement ) and \u20ac24.6 million ( 2016\u201317 ) .",
      "In 2015 Inter and Roma were the only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by the UEFA due to their breaking of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations , which was followed by Milan which was once barred from returning to European competition in 2018 . As a probation to avoid further sanction , Inter agreed to have a three-year aggregate break-even from 2015 to 2018 , with the 2015\u201316 season being allowed to have a net loss of a maximum of \u20ac30 million , followed by break-even in the 2016\u201317 season and onwards . Inter was also fined \u20ac6 million plus an additional \u20ac14 million in probation .",
      "Inter also made a financial trick in the transfer market in mid-2015 , in which Stevan Joveti\u0107 and Miranda were signed by Inter on temporary deals plus an obligation to sign outright in 2017 , making their cost less in the loan period . Moreover , despite heavily investing in new signings , namely Geoffrey Kondogbia and Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 that potentially increased the cost in amortization , Inter also sold Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 for \u20ac29 million , making a windfall profit . In November 2018 , documents from Football Leaks further revealed that the loan signings such as Xherdan Shaqiri in January 2015 , was in fact had inevitable conditions to trigger the outright purchase .",
      "On 21 April 2017 , Inter announced that their net loss ( FFP adjusted ) of 2015\u201316 season was within the allowable limit of \u20ac30 million . However , on the same day UEFA also announced that the reduction of squad size of Inter in European competitions would not be lifted yet , due to partial fulfilment of the targets in the settlement agreement . Same announcement was made by UEFA in June 2018 , based on Inters 2016\u201317 season financial result .",
      "In February 2020 , Inter Milan sued Major League Soccer ( MLS ) for trademark infringement , claiming that the term \u201cInter\u201d is synonymous with its club and no one else ."

The first Hennes was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a Cologne carnival joke . The current mascot is Hennes IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age . Another nickname for the club , more common locally due to its ambiguity , is FC ( often written as Effzeh ) , a common German abbreviation for football clubs . Characteristic for the dialect spoken around Cologne , this is pronounced EF-tsay , in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized ( ) . K\u00f6ln play at home in white and red , both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history .

      "K\u00f6lner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the gymnastics club FC Borussia K\u00f6ln and far more interested in football . BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before World War I who took the Westdeutsche championship in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the national finals . Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final , where they lost 1\u20133 to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach .",
      "Spielvereinigung 1907 K\u00f6ln-S\u00fclz was established in 1907 as S\u00fclzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fu\u00dfball Club 1908 Hertha S\u00fclz to form SpVgg . They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the national finals in their turn on that stage . They went on to play as a top flight club in the Gauliga Mittelrhein , one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich . The side earned generally good results through the 1930s \u2013 including a divisional championship in 1939 \u2013 but then faltered in the early 1940s . After the 1941 season the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions : the Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen and the Gauliga Moselland , which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg . S\u00fclz struggled until they were united with VfL K\u00f6ln 1899 for the 1943\u201344 season to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/S\u00fclz 07 which promptly won the Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen title by a single point over SG D\u00fcren 99 in a close race . The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region .",

FC K\u00f6ln began play in the tough Oberliga West in the 1949\u201350 season and by 1954 had won their first divisional championship . That same year they lost the DFB-Pokal final 1\u20130 to VfB Stuttgart . Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke won their second divisional championship in 1960 and appeared in the national final against Hamburger SV , where they went down to a 2\u20133 defeat . They went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons and again played their way to the national final in 1962 and 1963 . They won the 62 match 4\u20130 over 1 . FC N\u00fcrnberg resulting in entry to the 1962\u201363 European Cup where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy . In the first round K\u00f6ln visited Dundee F.C . of Scotland and lost 1\u20138 , and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4\u20130 they were out of the tournament . In the following years national final they lost 1\u20133 to Borussia Dortmund .",
      "Continuing success .",
      "In 1963 , FC K\u00f6ln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the Bundesliga , Germanys new professional football league . K\u00f6ln continued their winning ways by becoming the first ever Bundesliga champion in the leagues inaugural 1963\u201364 season . As German champions , K\u00f6ln entered the 1964\u201365 European Cup where it met Englands Liverpool at the quarter-final stage . After two 0\u20130 draws , a third game was played which was also a stalemate , this time 2\u20132 . As the penalty shootout had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie , K\u00f6ln went out of the competition on the toss of a coin . Ironically enough , there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground . The club also became the first Bundesliga side to field a Brazilian player when it signed Z\u00e9z\u00e9 for a then club record fee of DM 150,000 . Domestically , K\u00f6ln recorded a second-place finish in the 1964\u201365 Bundesliga season and won its first DFB-Pokal in 1967\u201368 .",
      "At the start of the 1970s , K\u00f6ln reached three DFB-Pokal finals in four seasons , losing all three ; to Kickers Offenbach in 1970 , Bayern Munich in 1971 and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in 1973 . The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in 1973 before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in 1977 , beating Hertha BSC over two legs to win the trophy for the second time .",
      "In 1977\u201378 , FC K\u00f6ln enjoyed its most successful season , winning the Bundesliga title , its third national title overall , and retaining the DFB-Pokal . This makes K\u00f6ln one of only four clubs to have won the double in the Bundesliga era .",
      "K\u00f6ln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in 1980 , before winning the competition for a fourth time in 1983 . In 1986 , the club appeared in its first European final , losing 5\u20133 on aggregate to Real Madrid in the UEFA Cup Final . Two second place Bundesliga finishes , in 1988\u201389 and 1989\u201390 , and another DFB-Pokal final loss in 1991 , marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC K\u00f6ln .",
      "21st century : ups and downs .",
      "In recent years , the clubs performance has been mixed . The FC holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history : in 2002 , the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes ( equivalent to 11-and-a-half games ) until Thomas Cichon found the back of the net again .",
      "In the early years of the Bundesliga , 1 . FC K\u00f6ln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won . Beginning in the early 1990s , however , the clubs performance fell , and in 1998 it was relegated for the first time . Since about 2000 , the side has been a yo-yo team , moving between the first and second divisions . It has returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the 2004\u201305 season as 2 . Bundesliga champions after having been relegated the season before . There was little optimism about their return to the top flight as they were picked by German football magazine kicker as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated .",
      "This prediction came true when K\u00f6ln lost to Hamburger SV 1\u20130 in the third-to-last match of the season . The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals . The teams most prolific goal scorer was Lukas Podolski with a total of 12 goals , who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season . He also appeared with the Germany national team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup .",
      "In late 2006 , former coach Christoph Daum was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2 . Bundesliga club and succeeded in leading the club back to the Bundesliga in 2008 . After a successful Bundesliga campaign in 2008\u201309 , Daum left K\u00f6ln for his former club Fenerbah\u00e7e . K\u00f6lns former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the 2009\u201310 season .",
      "After a poor run of form in the 2010\u201311 season , recording only one win from its opening nine Bundesliga fixtures , K\u00f6ln replaced coach Zvonimir Soldo with Frank Schaefer . Schaefer , who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of K\u00f6ln , decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga . Former Norwegian international and recent Copenhagen coach St\u00e5le Solbakken replaced him . After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season , Schaefer and former K\u00f6ln player Dirk Lottner replaced Solbakken . The club , however , was relegated at the end of the season , finishing in 17th place , having accumulated \u20ac33m debt , and \u20ac11m negative equity .",
      "Turnaround ( 2012\u20132017 ) .",
      "In April 2012 the club members elected a new board of directors , Werner Spinner as president , Markus Ritterbach for marketing , and Toni Schumacher for sport . In the 2012\u201313 season , under new trainer Holger Stanislawski , K\u00f6ln finished in fifth place in the 2 . Bundesliga , missing out on promotion back to the top division .",
      "In 2012 the board hired J\u00f6rg Jakobs as director of football who then got promoted in 2014 to sporting director , chief scout and director of the academy . In January 2013 Alexander Wehrle joined as managing director of FC K\u00f6ln ltd . Wehrle was working as assistant for VfB Stuttgart president Erwin Staudt , especially for rebuilding the stadium . In summer 2013 Peter St\u00f6ger and Manfred Schmid were hired as coaching team , and J\u00f6rg Schmadtke as general manager . 2013\u201314 K\u00f6ln finished first in the 2 . Bundesliga and earned promotion to the top division . It was followed by a 12th place 2014\u201315 , ninth in 2015\u201316 , and fifth place in 2016\u201317 . 25 years after the clubs last appearance in international football to date they qualified for the Europa League . After restructuring and repaying debt , equity turned from \u20ac11m negative to \u20ac20m positive . The turnover increased from \u20ac56m in 2012/13 to more than \u20ac120m in 2016/17 .",
      "Decline and changes ( 2018\u2013 ) .",
      "After the clubs return the European stage , fortunes quickly changed . The team experienced an unsuccessful start to the 2017\u201318 Bundesliga season gaining only three points from its first sixteen matches . At the same time , the clubs Europa League campaign ended after the group stage . This downtrend led to the resignation of J\u00f6rg Schmadtke and St\u00f6gers dismissal in December 2017 ; he was replaced by Stefan Ruthenbeck who was appointed as caretaker manager . In spite of an improved record in the second half of the season , the team finished last and were relegated to 2 . Bundesliga at the end of the year .",
      "Ahead of the 2018\u201319 season , Markus Anfang was appointed manager with a mandate to achieve an immediate return to the top flight . While the club occupied the leagues top spot for much of the season , Anfang was let go after a winless streak in April 2019 . Just a week later , with Andr\u00e9 Pawlak at the helm , the team achieved promotion with a 0\u20134 victory over Greuther F\u00fcrth . On 13 May 2019 , the club announced that Jahn Regensburg manager Achim Beierlorzer would assume its vacant head coaching position from the upcoming season . He was signed to a contract until 2021 . Following an unsuccessful start to the 2019\u201320 season , which included a 3\u20132 cup defeat against 1 . FC Saarbr\u00fccken , the club decided to terminate Beierlorzers contract on 9 November 2019 . Sporting director Armin Veh , who weeks earlier had announced that he would not extend his contract with the club , was also dismissed from his position . On 18 November , former HSV manager Markus Gisdol was appointed to the clubs head coaching position , while Horst Heldt was made sporting director . Both signed contracts until 2021 . After avoiding relegation at the end of the season , Gisdols contract was extended until 2023 .",
      "The club found itself in a renewed relegation during the 2020\u201321 season . On 11 April 2021 , after losing to relegation rival Mainz 05 , Gisdol was dismissed from his position as head coach . The next day , it was announced that Friedhelm Funkel would take over head coaching duties until the end of the season . On 11 May , it was reported that SC Paderborn manager Steffen Baumgart would succeed Funkel as head coach at the beginning of the 2021\u201322 season .",
      "However , despite a 1-0 home defeat to Holstein Kiel in the first leg of the relegation playoff , Funkel\u2019s side rallied and recorded an emphatic 5-1 away victory in the second leg . This ensured Baumgart would take over as head coach of a team staying in the Bundesliga .",
      "Stadium .",
      "The team plays its home matches in the M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion , also known as the RheinEnergie Stadion for sponsorship purposes . It has a seating capacity of 50,000 and the average attendance in the 2015\u201316 season was 48,676 . The stadium sponsorship comes from a contract with the local power supplier RheinEnergie AG . However , most fans still call the stadium M\u00fcngersdorfer Stadion , named after the suburb of M\u00fcngersdorf , where it is located .",
      "The club owns the Gei\u00dfbockheim training centre , currently known as RheinEnergieSportpark for sponsorship , located in S\u00fclz which is a municipal part of K\u00f6ln in the southwest of the city . The centre is home to the Franz-Kremer-Stadion the home of 1 . FC K\u00f6ln II .",

      "Ilya Vladimirovich Ponomarev ( ; born 6 August 1975 ) is a Russian politician , former member of the State Duma and a technology entrepreneur .",
      "He was the only member of the State Duma to vote against Russias annexation of Crimea during the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine . Ponomarev lives in Kyiv , Ukraine .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Ponomarev was born in Moscow . He holds a BSc in Physics from Moscow State University and a Master of Public Administration from the Russian State Social University . He started his career when he was 14 years old at the Institute for Nuclear Safety ( IBRAE ) , Russian Academy of Sciences .",
      "Ponomarev was one of the founders of two successful high technology start-ups in Russia , the first one ( RussProfi ) when he was sixteen years old . His first job position was at the Institute for Nuclear Safety ( IBRAE ) at the Russian Academy of Sciences . In 1995 and 1996 , Ponomarev acted as a representative of the networking software company Banyan Systems in Russia , creating one of the largest distributed networks in Russia for the now-defunct oil company Yukos . Following jobs at Schlumberger and Yukos in the late 1990s , he became a successful technology entrepreneur . From 2002 to 2007 , Ponomarev served as the chief information officer of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation .",
      "Career .",
      "Ponomarev held the role of vice president at Yukos Oil Company , at the time the largest Russian oil and gas corporation . Ponomarevs duties during those four years included those of corporate CIO , and chief executive of Yukos subsidiary company ARRAVA IMC , which specialized in advanced oilfield technologies and services . Ponomarev later founded the Siberian Internet Company , which was the origin of prominent Internet projects in Russia such as Gazeta.ru . He also spent time as the Director for Business Development and Marketing for Schlumberger Oilfield Services , and the vice president for strategy , regional development , and government relations at IBS , which was at that time the largest Russian system integration and software consulting company .",
      "From 2006 to 2007 , Ponomarev served as the national coordinator for the high-tech parks task force , a $6 billion private-public project to develop a network of small communities across the country to foster innovation and R&D activities .",
      "In December 2007 , Ponomarev was elected to the State Duma , representing Novosibirsk . In the Duma , Ponomarev chaired the Innovation and Venture Capital subcommittee of the Committee for Economic Development and Entrepreneurship , and the Technology Development subcommittee of the Committee of Information Technologies and Communications . He introduced and secured passage of legalization of LLPs in Russia , the Net Businesses Act , and tax breaks for technology companies .",
      "Ponomarevs political views are considered to be unorthodox left : a progressive libertarian position . Some people describe him as neo-communist , and critics inside the Communist Party of Russia have identified him as neotrotskyist . Ponomarevs policy goals included the following :",
      "- equal access to education , to create equal opportunities for everyone",
      "- a non-restrictive government which would be gradually replaced by direct democracy",
      "- promotion of social and business entrepreneurship and innovation to transform society",
      "- visa-free travel and abolition of national borders",
      "- replacement of the presidential republic in Russia with a parliamentary democracy , based on clear separation of power , a strong independent judiciary , and federalism ( with most taxes collected and spent by the regional governments )",
      "- protection of personal freedoms for oppressed groups , including increased rights and protections for women and LGBT people",
      "Internationally , Ponomarev advocated a broader Northern Union between the nations of Europe , the Americas , and the former USSR , but strongly criticizes the American model of globalization exemplified by the IMF , the WTO and the G8 structures . He describes his proposals as social globalism , and is critical of nationalism and clericalism . He also criticized the privatization process in Russia , and blamed its neoliberal architects for the failure to establish a true democracy in Russia .",
      "From 2012 to 2014 , Ponomarev was involved in International Business Development , Commercialization and Technology Transfer for the Skolkovo Foundation , managing the project initiated by Pres . Dmitry Medvedev to create SkolTech : a university established jointly by Russia and MIT .",
      "In April 2014 , Ponomarev organized a coalition of opposition groups for the election of the Mayor of Novosibirsk , and withdrew his own candidacy to support the coalitions candidate : Communist Anatoly Lokot , who won the election . In May 2014 , Ponomarev was appointed Counselor for Strategic Development and Investments for Novosibirsk .",
      "He was a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers ( IT ) , Council for Foreign and Defense Policies , and the Council for National Strategy , and a fellow at the Open Russia foundation . He also chaired the Boards of Trustees of the Institute of Innovation Studies ( a think tank working on legislation for high-tech industries ) and the Open Projects Foundation ( an investment vehicle for projects in crowdfunding , crowdsourcing and open government ) . In 2010 Ponomarev co-founded the Korean-Russian Business Council ( KRBC ) . . In 2014 , Ponomarev founded the Institute of Siberia , an analytical center focused on the regional development of Siberia .",
      "During his political career , he was a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation from 2002 to 2007 , and a member of the Central Committee of the social-democrat political party A Just Russia from 2007 to 2013 . In the spring of 2014 , he took part in forming an alliance between Greens and Social Democrats .",
      "Opposition to Putin .",
      "In 2012 , Ponomarev and fellow MP Dmitry G . Gudkov took a leadership role in street protests against Putins rule . Following the 4 March presidential election , in which Putin was elected for his third term as president , Ponomarev accused the government of rigging the election , claiming that it should have been close enough for a runoff . In May , Ponomarev criticized Putins decision to retain Igor Shuvalov in his cabinet despite a corruption scandal . The following month , Ponomarev and Gudkov led a filibuster against a bill by Putins United Russia party which allowed large fines to be imposed on anti-government protesters ; though the filibuster was unsuccessful , the action attracted widespread attention . Later , Ponomarev joined other political leaders in a successful challenge to the legislation before the Constitutional Court , overturning some of its provisions .",
      "In June 2012 , Ponomarev made a speech in the Duma in which he called United Russia members crooks and thieves , a phrase originally used by anti-corruption activist Aleksei Navalny . In September of that year , Duma members voted to censure Ponomarev and bar him from speaking for one month . United Russia members also proposed charging him with defamation .",
      "In July , he strongly criticized the government response to the widespread flooding in Southern Russia Krymsk , which killed 172 people . Together with several other civil activists , including Alyona Popova , Mitya Aleshkovsky , Danila Lindele and Maria Baronova , he organized a nationwide fundraising campaign which generated almost one million dollars in small donations to aid flood victims .",
      "In December 2012 , Ponomarev was the most vocal critic of the Dima Yakovlev Law , which restricted international adoption of Russian orphans ( he was the only MP to vote against the bill in the first reading , and one of only eight opponents during the final reading ) . In 2013 , Ponomarev was the only MP who refused to support the gay propaganda law . On 20 March 2014 , Ponomarev was the only State Duma member to vote against the accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation following the 2014 Crimean crisis .",
      "Internet censorship .",
      "In 2012 , Ponomarev supported the Internet Restriction Bill , with the stated purpose of fighting online child pornography and drug sales , introduced by fellow Just Russia parliamentarian Yelena Mizulina . Critics compared the results to those of the Chinese Internet firewall : a RosKomCenzura blocklist of censored pages , domain names , and IP addresses . Ponomarev claimed that he wished to ultimately limit government involvement in Internet regulation and allow more self-regulation , but Maxim Parker Kononenko ( a Russian blogger and journalist ) accused Ponomarev of acting in the commercial interests of a technology company which had Ponomarevs father Vladimir as a member of the board of directors According to the law , all Internet providers are obliged to install expensive DPI ( Deep Packet Inspection ) hardware , which it was believed would be sold by said company . However , the company ultimately never sold any DPI servers , and Vladimir Ponomarev resigned from the board to avoid the appearance of impropriety .",
      "In July 2013 , Ponomarev stated during a meeting of the Russian Pirate Party that his support for Mizulinas bill had been a mistake ; he later voted against new initiatives by the Russian government to restrict Internet freedom , and became instrumental in the campaign against the Russian version of SOPA . Despite this , Ponomarev is portrayed by some other opposition activists ( such as Alexey Navalny and Leonid Volkov ) as a censorship lobbyist , which Ponomarev claims is due to unrelated political disagreements and the struggle for influence over the Russian Internet community .",
      "Leonid Razvozzhayev incident .",
      "In October 2012 , the pro-government news channel NTV aired a documentary which accused Ponomarevs aide Leonid Razvozzhayev of arranging a meeting between a former opposition leader , the Left Fronts Sergei Udaltsov , and Givi Targamadze , a Georgian official , for the purpose of overthrowing President Vladimir Putin . A spokesman for Russian investigators stated that the government was considering terrorism charges against Udaltsov , and Razvozzhayev , Udaltsov , and Konstantin Lebedev , an assistant of Udaltsovs , were charged with plotting mass riots . Razvozzhayev fled to Kyiv , Ukraine , where he applied for asylum from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , but disappeared after leaving the office for lunch . He resurfaced in Moscow three days later , where the website Life News recording him leaving a Moscow courthouse , shouting that he had been abducted and tortured . A spokesman for Russias Investigative Committee claimed that Razvozzhayev had not been abducted , but had turned himself in freely and volunteered a confession of his conspiracy with Udaltsov and Lebedev to cause widespread rioting .",
      "Vladimir Burmatov , a United Russia MP , called on Ponomarev to resign from the State Duma for his association with Razvozzhayev .",
      "In August 2014 , both Udaltsov and Razvozzhayev were sentenced to four and a half years in prison .",
      "Russian annexation of Crimea and accusations of embezzlement .",
      "Ponomarev was the only member of the State Duma to vote against annexation of Crimea during the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine . Despite his criticism of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution as being driven by an alliance of neoliberals and nationalists , he justified his position in the Duma by saying that it was necessary to maintain friendly relations with the brotherly Ukrainian nation and avoid military confrontation , and argued that Russias actions in Crimea would push Ukraine outside the traditional sphere of Russian influence and possibly provoke further expansion of NATO . After the 445-1 vote , many people called for his resignation . He was also threatened with censure and expulsion , but responded that deputies cannot be prosecuted or removed because of the way they vote , and the parliament took no further action regarding the status of Ponomarev as deputy . In August 2014 , while he was in California , federal bailiffs froze Ponomarevs bank accounts and announced that they would not allow him to return to Russia , due to an ongoing investigation . He began living in San Jose , California , but since 2016 is a permanent resident of Ukraines capital Kyiv , effectively in exile . In April 2015 , the Duma attempted to revoke his constitutional protection from criminal prosecution .",
      "Russian investigators claimed Ponomarev had embezzled 22 million rubles earmarked for the Skolkovo technology hub , an accusation Ponomarev describes as politically motivated . Russian investigators alleged that Skolkovo Vice-President Aleksey Beltyukov had paid Ponomarev about $750,000 for ten lectures and one research paper ; . Ponomarev was initially not prosecuted for this because of his parliamentary immunity , but a court ordered him to return a part of the money . However , later in 2015 , the Moscow Bauman Court heard Ponomaryovs case in absentia and decided to arrest him , issuing an international warrant . Despite not residing in Russia , Ponomarev continued to hold his parliamentary position , and would technically have remained an active member of the Duma until the September 2016 Duma election .",
      "On 10 June 2016 , the State Duma impeached Ponomarev for truancy and not performing his duties . It was the first application of the controversial 2016 law that allows Duma to impeach its deputies .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Ponomarev is divorced . He has a son and a daughter . His mother , Larisa Ponomareva , was an MP in the upper house of Russias Parliament , the Federation Council , until September 2013 , when she was forced to resign following her lone vote against the Dima Yakovlev Law . Ponomarev is a nephew of Boris Ponomarev , Secretary for International Relations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . Ponomarevs grandfather Nikolai Ponomarev was the Soviet ambassador to Poland , and is believed to have prevented the USSRs invasion of the country along with Wojciech Jaruzelski , and paid with his career for doing that .",
      "Ponomarev told The Daily Beast in April 2016 that he lived in Ukraines capital Kyiv full-time . He has received a Ukrainian temporary residence permit .",
      "After fellow former Russian MP Denis Voronenkov was shot and killed in Kyiv on 23 March 2017 , Ponomarev was given personal protection by the Ukrainian Security Service . Voronenkov was on his way to meet Ponomarev when he was shot .",

      "Keith Emerson",
      "Keith Noel Emerson ( 2 November 1944 \u2013 11 March 2016 ) was an English keyboardist , songwriter , and composer . He played keyboards in a number of bands before finding his first commercial success with the Nice in the late 1960s . He became internationally famous for his work with the Nice , which included writing rock arrangements of classical music . After leaving the Nice in 1970 , he was a founding member of Emerson , Lake & Palmer ( ELP ) , one of the early progressive rock supergroups . Emerson , Lake & Palmer were commercially successful through much of the 1970s , becoming one of the best-known progressive rock groups of the era . Emerson wrote and arranged much of ELPs music on albums such as Tarkus ( 1971 ) and Brain Salad Surgery ( 1973 ) , combining his own original compositions with classical or traditional pieces adapted into a rock format .",
      "Following ELPs break-up at the end of the 1970s , Emerson pursued a solo career , composed several film soundtracks , and formed the bands Emerson , Lake & Powell and 3 to carry on in the style of ELP . In the early 1990s , Emerson rejoined ELP , which reunited for two more albums and several tours before breaking up again in the late 1990s . Emerson also reunited the Nice in 2002 for a tour .",
      "During the 2000s , Emerson resumed his solo career , including touring with his own Keith Emerson Band featuring guitarist Marc Bonilla and collaborating with several orchestras . He reunited with ELP bandmate Greg Lake in 2010 for a duo tour , culminating in a one-off ELP reunion show in London to celebrate the bands 40th anniversary . Emersons last album , The Three Fates Project , with Marc Bonilla and Terje Mikkelsen , was released in 2012 . Emerson reportedly suffered from depression and alcoholism , and in his later years developed nerve damage that hampered his playing , making him anxious about upcoming performances . He died by suicide on 11 March 2016 at his home in Santa Monica , California .",
      "Emerson was widely regarded as one of the top keyboard players of the progressive rock era . AllMusic describes Emerson as perhaps the greatest , most technically accomplished keyboardist in rock history .",
      "Early life .",
      "Emerson was born on 2 November 1944 in Todmorden , West Yorkshire . The family had been evacuated from southern England during World War II , after which they returned south and settled in Goring-by-Sea , West Sussex . Emerson attended West Tarring School in Tarring . His father Noel was an amateur pianist , while his mother was not musical . They arranged piano lessons for Emerson when he was eight ; he received tuition from local little old ladies and learned to read music . His studies in Western classical music largely inspired his own style in his professional career which often incorporated jazz and rock elements .",
      "Although Emerson did not own a record player , he enjoyed listening to music on the radio , particularly Floyd Cramers 1961 slip note-style On the Rebound and the work of Dudley Moore . He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books . He also listened to boogie-woogie , and to country-style pianists including Joe Mr Piano Henderson , Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell . Emerson later described himself : I was a very serious child . I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm . However , I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies . That was because I could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs . So , they thought I was kind of cool and left me alone .",
      "Emerson became interested in the Hammond organ after hearing jazz organist Jack McDuff perform Rock Candy , and the Hammond became his instrument of choice in the late 1960s . Emerson acquired his first Hammond organ , an L-100 model , at the age of 15 or 16 , on hire purchase . Emersons initial plan was for a non-musical career while playing the piano on the side . Upon leaving school he worked at Lloyds Bank Registrars where he played the piano in the bar at lunch times and local pubs at nights . He was ultimately fired from the bank .",
      "Career .",
      "1965\u20131970 : Early groups and The Nice .",
      "While performing in the Worthing area , Emerson received an offer to join his first professional group , the T-Bones , the backing band of blues singer Gary Farr . The group toured the UK and France before they disintegrated . Emerson then joined The V.I.P.s ; his noted flamboyance began when a fight broke out during a performance in France . Instructed by the band to keep playing , he produced some explosion and machine gun sounds with the Hammond organ , which stopped the fight . His band members told him to repeat the stunt at the next concert .",
      "In 1967 , Emerson formed the Nice with Lee Jackson , also of the T-Bones , David OList , and Ian Hague , after soul singer P . P . Arnold asked him to form a backing band . After replacing Hague with Brian Davison , the group set out on its own , quickly developing a strong live following . The groups sound was centred on Emersons Hammond organ showmanship and theatrical abuse of the instrument , and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes as symphonic rock .",
      "To increase the visual interest of his show , Emerson abused his Hammond L-100 organ by , among other things , hitting it , beating it with a whip , pushing it over , riding it across the stage like a horse , playing with it lying on top of him , and wedging knives into the keyboard . Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects : hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds , turning it over made it feed back , and the knives held down keys , thus sustaining notes . Emersons show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians .",
      "Emerson became well known for his work with the Nice . Outside of the group , he participated in the 1969 Music from Free Creek supersession project that included Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck . For the session , Emerson performed with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Chuck Rainey covering , among other tunes , the Eddie Harris instrumental Freedom Jazz Dance .",
      "Emerson first heard a Moog when a record shop owner played Switched-On Bach for him . Emerson said , My God thats incredible , what is that played on ? The owner then showed him the album cover . So I said , What is that ? And he said , Thats the Moog synthesizer . My first impression was that it looked a bit like electronic skiffle . Without one of his own , Emerson borrowed Mike Vickers Moog for an upcoming Nice concert at the Royal Festival Hall , London , with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra . Vickers helped patch the Moog , and the concert was a success . Emersons performance of Also sprach Zarathustra ( a composition most famous for its use in the 1968 film ) was acclaimed . Emerson later explained , I thought this was great . Ive got to have one of these .",
      "1970\u20131979 : Emerson , Lake & Palmer .",
      "In 1970 , Emerson left the Nice and formed Emerson , Lake & Palmer ( ELP ) with bassist Greg Lake from King Crimson and drummer Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster . After six months of focused rehearsal , the band played its first shows and recorded its first album , having quickly obtained a record deal with Atlantic Records . ELP became popular immediately after their 1970 Isle of Wight Festival performance , and continued to tour regularly throughout the 1970s . Not all were impressed , with BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel describing their Isle of Wight set as a tragic waste of talent and electricity . Their set , with a half-million onlookers , involved annihilating their instruments in a classical-rock blitz and firing cannons from the stage . Recalling the gig in a 2002 interview , Emerson said : We tried the cannons out on a field near Heathrow airport .. . They seemed harmless enough . Today we would have been arrested as terrorists .",
      "Use of synthesizers in ELP .",
      "ELPs record deal provided funds for Emerson to buy his own Moog modular synthesizer . He later said , It cost a lot of money and it arrived and I excitedly got it out of the box stuck it on the table and thought , Wow Thats Great ! a Moog synthesizer [ pause ] How do you switch it on ? .. . There were all these leads and stuff , there was no instruction manual . The patch which had been provided by Mike Vickers produced six distinctive Moog sounds , and these six became the foundation of ELPs sound .",
      "While other artists such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had used the Moog in studio recordings , Emerson was the first artist to tour with one . His use of the Moog was so critical to the development of new Moog models that he was given prototypes , such as the Constellation , which he took on one tour , and the Apollo , which had its d\u00e9but on the opening track Jerusalem on the 1973 album Brain Salad Surgery .",
      "The Moog was a temperamental device ; the oscillators went out of tune with temperature change . He later said , I had my faithful roady Rocky tune the instrument to A 440 just prior to the audience coming in , but once the audience came into the auditorium and the temperature rose up then everything went out of tune .",
      "His willingness to experiment with the Moog led to unexpected results , such as the time he stumbled into the signature sound for Hoedown , one of ELPs most popular tunes . He later said , Wed started working on that arrangement and then I hit , I dont know what , I switched a blue button and I put a patch cord in there , but anyway whoooeee .",
      "The so-called Monster Moog , built from numerous modules , weighed , stood feet tall and took four roadies to move . Even with its unpredictability , it became an indispensable component of not only ELPs concerts , but also Emersons own .",
      "As synthesiser technology evolved , Emerson went on to use a variety of other synthesisers made by Moog and other companies , including the Minimoog , the Yamaha GX-1 used on ELPs Works Volume 1 album , and several models by Korg ( see Instrumentation ) .",
      "As composer and arranger .",
      "Emerson performed several notable rock arrangements of classical compositions , ranging from J . S . Bach and Modest Mussorgsky to 20th-century composers such as B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k , Aaron Copland , Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek and Alberto Ginastera . Occasionally Emerson quoted from classical and jazz works without giving credit , particularly early in his career , from the late 1960s until 1972 . An early example of Emersons arranging was the song Rondo by the Nice , which is a 4/4 interpretation of Dave Brubecks 9/8 composition Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk . The piece is introduced by an extensive excerpt from the 3rd movement of Bachs Italian Concerto .",
      "On ELPs eponymous first album , Emersons classical quotes went largely uncredited . Classical pianist Peter Donohoe has said that The Barbarian was an arrangement of Allegro barbaro by Bart\u00f3k , and that Knife Edge was based on the main theme of the opening movement of Sinfonietta by Jan\u00e1\u010dek . By 1971 , with the releases Pictures at an Exhibition and Trilogy , ELP began to fully credit classical composers , including Modest Mussorgsky for the piano piece which inspired the Pictures album , and Aaron Copland for Hoedown on the Trilogy album . Emerson indicated in an interview that he based his version of Pictures at an Exhibition on Mussorgskys original piano composition , rather than on Maurice Ravels later orchestration of the work .",
      "Following ELPs 1974 tour , the members agreed to put the band on temporary hiatus and pursue individual solo projects . During this time , Emerson composed his Piano Concerto No . 1 and recorded it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra . According to Emerson , he was motivated by critical comments suggesting that he relied upon adapting classical works because he was unable to write his own music , and further motivated by the London Philharmonic who werent that helpful to begin with and had the attitude of Whats a rock musician doing writing a piano concerto ? Emerson said , I wanted people to say , look , Im a composer , I do write my own music , and what greater challenge than to write a piano concerto . The recording later appeared on ELPs album Works Volume 1 . Emersons concerto has since been performed by classical pianists , most notably Jeffrey Biegel , who has performed it several times and recorded it with Emersons permission .",
      "In 1976 , while still in ELP , Emerson also released his first solo record , the single Honky Tonk Train Blues b/w Barrelhouse Shake-Down . Honky Tonk Train Blues , Emersons cover of a 1927 boogie-woogie piano song by Meade Lux Lewis , reached on the UK Singles Chart .",
      "Theatrics .",
      "In addition to his technical skills at playing and composing , Emerson was a theatrical performer . He cited guitarist Jimi Hendrix and organist Don Shinn as his chief theatrical influences . While in ELP , Emerson continued to some degree the physical abuse of his Hammond organ that he had developed with the Nice , including playing the organ upside down while having it lie over him and using knives to wedge down specific keys and sustain notes during solos . In addition to using his knives on the organ , he also engaged in knife throwing onstage , using a target fastened in front of his Leslie speakers . He was given his trademark knife , an authentic Nazi dagger , by Lemmy Kilmister , who was a roadie for the Nice in his earlier days .",
      "Over time , Emerson toned down his act with the organ in response to ELPs greater reliance on spectacular stage props . For example , during the Brain Salad Surgery tour , at the end of the show , a sequencer in Emersons Moog Modular synthesiser was set running at an increasing rate , with the synthesiser pivoting to face the audience while emitting smoke and deploying a large pair of silver bat wings from its back .",
      "One of Emersons memorable live show stunts with ELP involved playing a piano suspended 15 to 20 feet in mid-air and then rotated end-over-end with Emerson sitting at it . This was purely for visual effect , as according to Greg Lake , the piano was fake and had no works inside . In a 2014 interview with Classic Rock Music journalist Ray Shasho , Emerson was asked about the origin of the flying piano and about the difficulty of performing while spinning in the air . He explained :",
      "I think having a pilots licence helped a little bit . One of my road crew said we found this guy that used to work in the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and hes made something that might interest you , its a piano that spins round , and I immediately responded , oh that sounds interesting . I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy , and there in the background he had this piano situated . So he called his wife down from upstairs and said , darling could you demonstrate this for Keith ? I looked on , I wasnt quite sure what to expect . His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around . I thought , well thats great ! Then Bob asked me , do you want to have a go at it ? .. . Yea , okay . You need to understand , below the keyboard theres an inverted-tee , like a bar . You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee . Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play . It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force , so it wasnt easy . I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden , it was a Christmas concert . People in the audience were so astounded they couldnt quite believe what they were seeing . Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there . Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up . There were loads of bands up on that stage , all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off . Now , with the moog , the Hammonds , Carls gongs and everything , it was hard enough to just get that off stage . We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it . It ended up going just at the end of the stage , so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience . After that every TV show I did came the question .. . Keith , how do you spin around on that piano ? Id say what about my music ? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died , he said , Keith youve got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano ? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said , Dave , dont try it !",
      "The spinning piano was part of ELPs stage show only for a short time due to the complexity of the stunt and the number of injuries sustained by Emerson while performing it , including many finger injuries and a broken nose . Emerson wanted to use the spinning piano again at ELPs 2010 reunion concert at the High Voltage Festival in London , but was forbidden from using it by the local authority who said that the plans did not meet Health and Safety standards .",
      "1979\u20131991 : Solo and group projects .",
      "After ELP disbanded in 1979 , Emerson pursued a variety of projects during the 1980s and 1990s , including solo releases , soundtrack work and other bands , including supergroup the Best . In the early 1990s , Emerson rejoined the reunited ELP , but the group broke up again by the end of that decade .",
      "Solo career .",
      "In 1981 , Emerson released his debut solo album , Honky . Recorded in the Bahamas with local musicians , it departed from Emersons usual style in featuring calypso and reggae songs , and was generally not well received , except in Italy where it was a hit . Emersons subsequent solo releases were sporadic , including a Christmas album in 1988 , and the album Changing States ( also known as Cream of Emerson Soup ) recorded in 1989 but not released until 1995 , after several of its songs had already been re-recorded and released in different versions on ELPs 1992 comeback album Black Moon . Changing States also contained an orchestral remake of the ELP song Abaddons Bolero with the London Philharmonic Orchestra , and The Church , which Emerson composed for the 1989 Michele Soavi horror film of the same name .",
      "Soundtrack work .",
      "In the 1980s , Emerson began to write and perform music for films , as his orchestral and classical style was more suited for film work than for the new wave-dominated pop/ rock market . Films for which Emerson contributed soundtrack music include Dario Argentos Inferno ( 1980 ) , the action thriller Nighthawks ( 1981 ) starring Sylvester Stallone , ( 1984 film ) Best Revenge , notable because he collaborated with Brad Delp from the band Boston on this soundtrack , that also featured an instrumental piece called Dream Runner that became a standard solo performance piece for Emerson during at ELP shows throughout the next decade , Lucio Fulcis Murder Rock ( 1984 ) , and Michele Soavis The Church ( also known as La chiesa ) ( 1989 ) . He was also the composer for the short-lived 1994 US animated television series Iron Man .",
      "1980s and 1990s bands .",
      "Starting in the mid-1980s , Emerson formed several short-lived supergroups . The first two , Emerson , Lake & Powell ( with Lake and ex-Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell ) and 3 ( with Palmer and American multi-instrumentalist Robert Berry ) , were intended to carry on in the general style of ELP in the absence of one of the original members . Emerson , Lake & Powell had some success , and their sole album is considered one of the best of both Emersons and Lakes careers . Stylistically , it was a departure from their 1980s progressive rock peers , Genesis and Asia . Progressive rock analyst Edward Macan wrote that Emerson , Lake & Powell were closer to the classic ELP sound than ELPs own late-1970s output . By contrast , 3s only album sold poorly and drew comparisons to the worst moments of Love Beach ( which had been a commercial disaster for ELP ) .",
      "Emerson also toured briefly in 1990 with The Best , a supergroup including John Entwistle of The Who , Joe Walsh of the Eagles , Jeff Skunk Baxter of Steely Dan and The Doobie Brothers , and Simon Phillips . This project focused on covering songs from each of the members past bands .",
      "In the early 1990s , Emerson formed the short-lived group Aliens of Extraordinary Ability with Stuart Smith , Richie Onori , Marvin Sperling and Robbie Wyckoff . The groups name came from the application process for a US work visa , and the members included several British musicians who , like Emerson , had come to Los Angeles to further their careers . The group turned down a record deal with Samsung because of Emersons commitment to an ELP reunion and Smiths involvement with a possible reformation of The Sweet .",
      "1991\u20131998 : Reunion with ELP .",
      "In 1991 , ELP reformed for two more albums ( Black Moon ( 1992 ) and In the Hot Seat ( 1994 ) ) and world tours in 1992\u20131993 . After the 1993 tour , Emerson was forced to take a year off from playing due to a nerve condition affecting his right hand ( see Health issues ) . Following his recovery , ELP resumed touring in 1996 , including a successful US tour with Jethro Tull , but broke up again in August 1998 .",
      "1998\u20132016 .",
      "Emerson participated in the Nices reunion tour and a 40th anniversary show for ELP , preceded by a short duo tour with Greg Lake . Apart from these reunions , he continued his solo career , releasing solo and soundtrack albums , touring with his own Keith Emerson Band , and making occasional guest appearances . Starting in 2010 , he increasingly focused on orchestral collaborations . A documentary film based on his autobiography was reportedly in production at the time of his death in 2016 .",
      "Reunion shows .",
      "In 2002 Emerson reformed and toured with the Nice , though performing a longer set of ELP music using a backing band including guitarist/vocalist Dave Kilminster . During the spring of 2010 , he toured with Greg Lake in the United States and Canada , doing a series of Intimate Evening duo shows in which they performed newly arranged versions of the music of Emerson , Lake & Palmer , the Nice , and King Crimson as well as Emersons new original composition . On 25 July 2010 , a one-off Emerson , Lake & Palmer reunion concert closed the High Voltage Festival as the main act in Victoria Park , East London , to commemorate the bands 40th anniversary .",
      "Solo career and Keith Emerson Band .",
      "Emerson continued his solo and soundtrack work into the 2000s . His solo releases included the all-piano album Emerson Plays Emerson ( 2002 ) , several compilations , and contributions to Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin tribute albums ( see Discography ) . He was also one of three composers who contributed to the soundtrack for the Japanese kaiju film ( 2004 ) .",
      "Following the August 2008 release of the album Keith Emerson Band Featuring Marc Bonilla , Emerson also toured with his own self-named band in Russia , the Baltic States and Japan between August and October 2008 . The tour band members were Marc Bonilla , Travis Davis and Tony Pia .",
      "Orchestral collaborations .",
      "Japanese composer Takashi Yoshimatsu worked with Emerson to create an arrangement of ELPs song Tarkus , which premiered on 14 March 2010 , performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra . Yoshimatsus arrangement has been featured in multiple live performances and two live recordings .",
      "In September 2011 , Emerson began working with Norwegian conductor Terje Mikkelsen , along with the Keith Emerson Band featuring Marc Bonilla and the Munich Radio Orchestra , on new orchestral renditions of ELP classics and their new compositions . The project The Three Fates was premiered in Norway in early September 2012 , supervised by Norwegian professor and musician Bj\u00f8rn Ole Rasch for the Norwegian Simax label . The work received its UK live premiere on 10 July 2015 at Londons Barbican Centre , with the BBC Concert Orchestra , as part of the celebration of the life and work of Robert Moog .",
      "Emerson made his conducting debut with Orchestra Kentucky of Bowling Green , Kentucky in September 2013 . In October 2014 , Emerson conducted the South Shore Symphony at his 70th birthday tribute concert at Molloy College in Rockville Centre , New York . The concert also featured the premiere of his Three String Quartets , and a performance of Emersons Piano Concerto No . 1 by Jeffrey Biegel .",
      "Other appearances and activities .",
      "In 2000 , Emerson was a featured panelist and performer at The Keyboard Meets Modern Technology , an event honouring Moog presented by the Smithsonian in Washington , D.C. , in conjunction with a gallery exhibition celebrating the 300th anniversary of the piano . Emerson later headlined both the first and third Moogfest , a festival held in honour of Robert Moog , at the B . B . King Blues Club & Grill at Times Square in New York City , in 2004 and 2006 respectively .",
      "Emerson opened the Led Zeppelin reunion/Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London on 10 December 2007 , along with Chris Squire and Alan White ( Yes ) and Simon Kirke ( Bad Company/Free ) . The supergroup played a new arrangement of Fanfare for the Common Man . Emerson also made a guest appearance in 2009 on Spinal Taps album Back from the Dead , and played on several songs at Spinal Taps One Night Only World Tour at Wembley Arena on 30 June 2009 .",
      "In 2004 Emerson published his autobiography entitled Pictures of an Exhibitionist , which dealt with his life up to his nearly career-ending nerve-graft surgery in 1993 . In 2007 , Emerson began working with Canadian independent filmmaker Jason Woodford to make a documentary film based on his autobiography . As of March 2016 , production was still ongoing and the filmmakers were seeking funding to finish the film , according to the webpage of an artists management company representing Emerson .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Emerson married his Danish girlfriend , Elinor , around Christmas 1969 . They had two sons , Aaron and Damon , but later divorced . He later had a long-term relationship with Mari Kawaguchi .",
      "Emerson enjoyed flying as a hobby , and he obtained his pilots licence in 1972 . When Emerson moved to Santa Monica , California , in the mid-1990s , John Lydon , who had openly and harshly criticized ELP during the 1970s when Lydon was a member of the punk band Sex Pistols , was Emersons neighbour . The two became friends , with Lydon saying in a 2007 interview , Hes a great bloke .",
      "Health issues .",
      "In 1993 , Emerson was forced to take a year off from playing after he developed a nerve-related condition affecting his right hand that he likened to writers cramp and that was also reported as a form of arthritis . According to Emerson , this coincided with his divorce , his Sussex home burning down , and financial difficulties . During his time off , he ran marathons , customised a Harley-Davidson motorcycle , and wrote film scores and his autobiography , Pictures of an Exhibitionist , which opens and closes with an account of his illness and subsequent arm operation . In 2002 , he claimed to have regained full use of his hands and could play to his usual strength . In 2016 , he was corresponding with a carpal-tunnel syndrome expert named Jill Gambaro about his struggle with focal dystonia who said \u201cMusicians can\u2019t talk about it because they won\u2019t get another gig if word gets out that they\u2019re in pain so they keep quiet.\u201d",
      "In September 2010 , Emerson released a message stating : During a routine medical examination , a colonoscopy revealed a rather dangerous polyp in my lower colon . It is the conclusion of the doctors here in London that I must undergo surgery immediately . Unfortunately , the timing of this urgent surgery does not allow me to start touring in early October because of the required period of hospitalization and recuperation . I must remain optimistic that all will turn out well .",
      "Death .",
      "Emerson died on 11 March 2016 in Santa Monica , California , of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head . His body was found at his Santa Monica home . Following an autopsy , the medical examiner ruled Emersons death a suicide , and concluded that he had also suffered from heart disease and from depression associated with alcohol . According to Emersons girlfriend Mari Kawaguchi , Emerson had become depressed , nervous and anxious because nerve damage had hampered his playing , and he was worried that he would perform poorly at upcoming concerts in Japan and disappoint his fans .",
      "Emerson was buried on 1 April 2016 at Lancing and Sompting Cemetery , Lancing , West Sussex . Although his death had been reported by news sources and an official Emerson , Lake and Palmer social media page as having occurred on the night of 10 March , his grave memorial gives his date of death as 11 March 2016 .",
      "His former ELP bandmates , Carl Palmer and Greg Lake , both issued statements on his death . Palmer said , Keith was a gentle soul whose love for music and passion for his performance as a keyboard player will remain unmatched for many years to come . Lake said , As sad and tragic as Keiths death is , I would not want this to be the lasting memory people take away with them . What I will always remember about Keith Emerson was his remarkable talent as a musician and composer and his gift and passion to entertain . Music was his life and despite some of the difficulties he encountered I am sure that the music he created will live on forever . Lake died later that same year .",
      "A tribute concert featuring Brian Auger , Jordan Rudess , Eddie Jobson , Aaron Emerson , Steve Lukather , Steve Porcaro , Marc Bonilla and Rachel Flowers took place at the El Rey Theatre . Proceeds from sales of the DVD go to the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation .",
      "Playing style .",
      "Emerson sometimes reached into the interior of his piano and hit , plucked , or strummed the strings with his hand . He said that as a keyboard player , he hated the idea of being static and that to avoid it , he wanted to get inside the piano , brush the strings , stick Ping-Pong balls inside . Take a Pebble included Emerson strumming the strings of his piano as if he were playing an autoharp . In the Nices 1968 live performance of Hang on to a Dream on the German television program Beat-Club ( later released on DVD in 1997 ) , Emerson can be seen and heard reaching inside his grand piano at one point and plucking its strings .",
      "In addition to such experimentation , Emerson also incorporated unique musical stylization into his work . Emerson is recognized for having integrated different sounds into his writing , utilizing methods of both horizontal and vertical contrast . Horizontal contrast is the use of distinct styles in a piece of music , combined by alternating between two different segments ( in Emersons case , most frequently alternating classical and non-classical ) ; this technique can be seen in numerous works , such as Rondo , Tantalising Maggie , The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack and others . Vertical contrast is the combination of multiple styles simultaneously ; Emerson frequently played a given style with one hand and a contrasting one with the other . This structure can be seen in works such as Intermezzo from the Karelia Suite , Rondo , and others . Emersons love of modern music such as Copland and Bartok was evident in his open voicings and use of fifths and fourths , Fanfare emulating guitar power chords . He also used dissonance , atonality , sonata and fugue forms , exposing rock and roll audiences to a myriad of classical styles from Bach to Stravinsky .",
      "Instrumentation .",
      "Emerson used a variety of electronic keyboard instruments during his career , including several Hammond organs and synthesisers by Moog Music , Yamaha , and Korg . From time to time he also used other instruments such as pipe organs , a grand piano , a clavinet , and very briefly , a Mellotron . During his ELP years , Emerson toured with a large amount of gear , taking thirteen keyboard units to a December 1973 show at Madison Square Garden , and later traveling with a large Yamaha GX-1 that required eight roadies to move it . Michael Supe Granda of The Ozark Mountain Daredevils recalled Emersons organ rig as being as large as [ the Daredevils ] entire stage plot .",
      "Pre-ELP equipment and Hammond organs .",
      "Initially a piano player , Emerson obtained his first Hammond organ , an L-100 , after hearing jazz organist Jack McDuff and becoming frustrated with broken hammers inside pianos . Around 1968 , during his time with the Nice , he added a second Hammond organ , the more expensive C-3 , and placed the two organs sideways and facing each other so he could stand between the two keyboards and play both with his unobstructed body facing the audience . Emerson preferred the sound of the C-3 as being far superior to the cheaper L-100 , and used the L100 to throw around and make it feed back . Emerson got the L-100 to feed back by placing it close to the onstage speakers and using a fuzzbox . He continued to perform physical abuse stunts with the L-100 to some degree throughout his years with ELP .",
      "Throughout his career , Emerson owned a number of L-100 models in various states of repair to support his act . These organs were also specially reinforced and modified to enhance their sound and help prevent damage while on tour , and were reported to weigh 300 to 350 pounds . By contrast , his C-3 organ was not used for stunts and Emerson continued to play his original C-3 for many years , using it on all the ELP albums and tours throughout the 1970s . He also owned several other Hammond organ models in addition to the L-100s and the C-3 . When Emerson sold much of his gear in the mid-1990s , his Hammond organs were among the items he kept as being too personal to let go . The remains of one L-100 that failed and burned during a 1990s ELP show in Boston were donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .",
      "ELP equipment and Moog synthesisers .",
      "With ELP , Emerson added the Moog synthesiser behind the C-3 with the keyboard and ribbon controller stacked on the top of the organ . The ribbon controller allowed Emerson to vary pitch , volume or timbre of the output from the Moog by moving his finger up and down the length of a touch-sensitive strip . It also could be used as a phallic symbol , and outfitted with a small rocket launcher , it quickly became a feature of the act . He continued to divide his keyboard setup into two banks so that he could play between them with his body in view . When the ultra-compact Moog Minimoog first appeared it was placed where needed , such as on top of the grand piano . A Hohner clavinet L , with reversed black and white keys , was also part of Emersons keyboard rig . Although it could be heard on numerous album pieces , according to Emerson , it was only used for one song , Nut Rocker in concert .",
      "During the Brain Salad Surgery tour of 1974 , Emersons keyboard setup included the Hammond C-3 organ , run through multiple Leslie speakers driven by HiWatt guitar amplifiers , the Moog 3C modular synthesiser ( modified by addition of various modules and an oscilloscope ) with ribbon controller , a Steinway concert grand piano with a Minimoog synthesiser on top of it , an upright acoustic-electric piano that was used for honky-tonk piano sounds , a Hohner Clavinet and another Minimoog synthesiser . Emerson also used a prototype polyphonic synthesiser produced by Moog , which was the test bed for the Moog Polymoog polyphonic synthesiser . The original synthesiser setup as envisioned by Moog was called the Constellation , and consisted of three instruments \u2013 the polyphonic synthesiser , called the Apollo , a monophonic lead synthesiser called the Lyra , and a bass-pedal synthesiser , called the Taurus , but Emerson never used the Taurus .",
      "Pipe organs .",
      "Occasionally Emerson used a pipe organ , when available , in live performances and on recordings . He played the Royal Albert Hall Organ at a show with the Nice on 26 June 1968 , where the band controversially burned a painting of an American flag onstage to protest against the Vietnam War . The stunt caused a storm of objections in the US and the Nice received a lifetime ban from the venue .",
      "With ELP , Emerson used the Royal Festival Hall organ for the Clotho segment of The Three Fates on the 1970 eponymous debut album by ELP . He played this organ again in 2002 to open a Nice reunion tour show , but according to a reviewer , the organ failed to operate at the expected volume .",
      "The Newcastle City Hall organ was used for the introductory section of Pictures at an Exhibition , recorded there live on 26 March 1971 . Emerson was recorded playing the organ at St . Marks Church in London for The Only Way ( Hymn ) on the 1971 ELP album Tarkus .",
      "Yamaha GX-1 synthesisers .",
      "After founder Robert Moog left Moog Music in the late 1970s , Emerson began to consider using synthesisers made by other companies . Emerson became one of the few buyers of the Yamaha GX-1 polyphonic synthesiser , which reportedly cost almost $50,000 . The GX-1 was subsequently used on the ELP album Works Volume 1 , particularly on the song Fanfare for the Common Man , and on tour . It can be seen in ELPs Works Orchestral Tour video and in promotional photos and videos from 1977 featuring the band playing Fanfare outdoors during a snowstorm in Montreals Olympic Stadium . Emerson later bought a second GX-1 from John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin , and used parts from it to repair his original GX-1 , which was damaged by a tractor crashing into Emersons home studio .",
      "Emerson sold much of his keyboard equipment in the 1990s when he relocated from England to Santa Monica , California . The John Paul Jones GX-1 was sold to film composer Hans Zimmer , while Emersons original GX-1 was sold to Italian keyboardist Riccardo Grotto .",
      "Korg synthesisers .",
      "In the late 1970s , Emerson also began to use the Korg PS-3300 and PS-3100 , which at the time were among the worlds first fully polyphonic synthesizers . These Korgs appeared on the ELP album Love Beach , and Emerson continued to use them into the 1980s for his solo album Honky and his soundtrack work . He also became an official endorser for the PS-3300 and PS-3100 in the early 1980s .",
      "By the late 2000s , Emerson was employing a host of Korg gear including the Korg OASYS and Korg Triton Extreme music workstation synthesisers . A review of the DVD release of ELPs 2010 one-off reunion show said that the Korg OASYS appear [ ed ] to be Emersons go-to instrument , although he also used a Hammond C-3 and a Moog with a ribbon controller onstage .",
      "Honours and awards .",
      "In December 1980 Contemporary Keyboard magazine announced , in their Fifth Annual Readers Poll , that Emerson had\u2014for the fifth time in a row\u2014captured first place in two categories - Overall Best Keyboardist and Best Multi-Keyboardist . The five-time wins put Emerson in their Gallery Of The Greats for both categories . The same poll also saw Emerson take Best Rock Organist for the fourth time and Best Lead Synthesist .",
      "In March 2010 Emerson received the annual Frankfurt Music Prize for his achievements , awarded in Frankfurt on the eve of the annual Musikmesse fair .",
      "In September 2013 Orchestra Kentucky of Bowling Green gave Emerson their Lifetime Achievement Award in the Arts and Humanities for his role in bringing classical music to the masses .",
      "In 2014 Emerson was inducted into the Hammond Hall of Fame by the Hammond Organ Company .",

      "Emerson occasionally covered or sampled other musical works in his compositions . Permission to use pieces was sometimes denied by the composer or his family ; for example Gustav Holsts daughter refused to grant official permission for rock bands to perform her late fathers composition Mars , the Bringer of War . However , a number of composers did grant permission for their works to be used . Aaron Copland said that there was something that attracted [ him ] about ELPs version of Fanfare for the Common Man , and so approved its use , although he said , What they do in the middle ( i.e. , the modal section between repeats of Coplands theme ) , Im not sure exactly how they connect that with my music . Alberto Ginastera , on the other hand , enthusiastically approved Emersons electronic realisation of the fourth movement of his first piano concerto , which appeared on their album Brain Salad Surgery under the title Toccata . Ginastera said , You have captured the essence of my music , and no ones ever done that before .",

      "Bank of America Plaza is a skyscraper located between Midtown Atlanta and Downtown Atlanta . At , the tower is the 125th-tallest building in the world . It is the 21st tallest building in the U.S. , the tallest building in Georgia , and the tallest building in any U.S . state capital , overtaking the , 50-story One Atlantic Center in height , which previously held the record as Georgias tallest building . It has 55 stories of office space and was completed in 1992 , when it was called NationsBank Plaza . Originally intended to be the headquarters for Citizens & Southern National Bank ( which merged with Sovran Bank during construction ) , it became NationsBanks property following its formation in the 1991 hostile takeover of C&S/Sovran by NCNB .",
      "Architectural details .",
      "The building was developed by Cousins Properties and designed by the architectural firm Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates LLC . Designed in the Postmodern style reminiscent of Art Deco , it was built in only 14 months , one of the fastest construction schedules for any building . The Plazas imposing presence is heightened by the dark color of its exterior . It soars into the sky with vertical lines that reinforce its height while also creating an abundance of revenue-generating corner offices . It is located over on Peachtree Street .",
      "There is a obelisk-like spire at the top of the building echoing the shape of the building as a whole . Most of the spire is covered in 23 karat ( 96 percent ) gold leaf . The open-lattice steel pyramid underneath the obelisk glows yellow-orange at night due to lighting . Originally , the lattice was designed to be clad in glass , but the engineers failed to take the weight of the glass into account . At its most basic , this is a modern interpretation of the Art Deco theme seen in the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building . The inhabited part of the building actually ends abruptly with a flat roof . On top of this is built a pyramid of girders , which are gilded and blaze at night , with the same type of yellow-orange high-pressure sodium ( HPS ) lighting used in older-style street lights . Its design has been characterized as similar to the Messeturm in Frankfurt am Main , Germany .",
      "The skyscraper , built at a 45-degree angle to the citys street grid , is set back off its eastern and western street boundaries , Peachtree Street and West Peachtree Street , by over 50 yards ( 45 m ) . This setback is filled , variously , by driveways , parking garage entrances , potted plants , granite staircases , and sloping lawns . The building directly abuts the sidewalk on North Avenue , its northern boundary , with access to this street through a parking garage entrance and stairs leading from the buildings main lobby .",
      "Some urban planners decry the building as a Corbusian tower in a park , as it actively disengages itself from the urban environment surrounding it , entirely omitting sidewalk-facing retail space . Critics argue that the building encourages its tenants to access it primarily by car and to remain inside the complex during the day . However it is across the street from the MARTA-rail North Avenue station .",
      "Developers have rumored that the land under the surrounding driveways and lawns may be redeveloped into low- and mid-rise mixed-use buildings with street-fronting uses as the area urbanizes and the value of land in Midtown Atlanta increases . In 2014 , new sidewalks , pavers , ADA ramps , pedestrian light-poles , improved tree wells , new bike racks and landscaping were planned . These neighborhood improvements were completed by 2016 at a cost of $1.04 million .",
      "Upon its completion Bank of America Plaza was the tallest building in the United States outside New York City and Chicago , and the 8th-tallest building in the U.S . overall .",
      "Renovations and sustainable building initiative .",
      "In 2014 , a $30 million renovation to the lobby , health club , and conference facility was completed It has also achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) Silver certification . The building and property management were awarded Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce E3 Liquid Assets , a recognition in water sustainability . Midtown Atlantas Midtown Alliance also recognized it as an EcoDistrict Green Luminary for its significant commitment to sustainability practices .",
      "Beginning in 2016 , $15 million will be invested over the next few years to significantly modernize the common areas including the lobby , west wing and some deferred maintenance .",
      "Building ownership .",
      "BentleyForbes acquired the building from Cousins Properties in 2006 for $436 million , a record price at $348 per square foot . In 2012 , LNR and lenders acquired the property via foreclosure .",

      "Toungoo dynasty",
      "The Toungoo dynasty ( , ; also spelt Taungoo dynasty ) , and also known as the Restored Toungoo dynasty , was the ruling dynasty of Burma ( Myanmar ) from the mid-16th century to 1752 . Its early kings Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung succeeded in reunifying the territories of the Pagan Kingdom for the first time since 1287 and in incorporating the Shan States for the first time . At its peak , Toungoo Empire was the largest and strongest empire as well as one of the richest empires in Southeast Asia , in addition to including Manipur , Chinese Shan States , Siam and Lan Xang . But the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia collapsed in the 18 years following Bayinnaungs death in 1581 .",
      "The dynasty quickly regrouped under the leadership of Nyaungyan Min and his son , Anaukpetlun , who succeeded in restoring a smaller , more manageable kingdom , encompassing Lower Burma , Upper Burma , Shan States and Lan Na by 1622 . The Restored Toungoo kings , now based in Ava ( Inwa ) , created a legal and political system whose basic features would continue under the Konbaung dynasty well into the 19th century . The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs . Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years .",
      "The kingdom entered a gradual decline due to the palace rule of its kings . Starting from the 1720s , the kingdom was beset with raids by the Meitei people of the Chindwin River , and a rebellion in Chiang Mai . Raids by the Meitei intensified in the 1730s , reaching increasingly deeper parts of central Burma . In 1740 , the Mon people in Lower Burma began a rebellion , founding the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom . The Hanthawaddy armies captured Inwa in 1752 and ended the 266-year-old Toungoo dynasty .",
      "History .",
      "King Mingyi Nyo founded the First Taungoo Dynasty ( 1485\u20131599 ) at Taungoo far up the Sittaung River south of Inwa towards the end of the Ava Kingdom in 1510 . After the conquest of Inwa by the Mohnyin-led Shan sawbwas in 1527 , many Burmese-speakers migrated to Taungoo , which became a new centre .",
      "Mingyi Nyos son , King Tabinshwehti , unified most of Burma , consolidating his power and pushing southward , over-running the Irrawaddy Delta and crushing the Hanthawaddy capital of Bago . In 1544 , Tabinshwehti was crowned as king of all Burma at the ancient capital of Bagan . By this time , the geopolitical situation in Southeast Asia had changed dramatically . The Shan gained power in a new kingdom in the north , the Ayutthaya Kingdom had established itself as a suzerain power around the Chao Phraya river basin , while the Portuguese Empire had arrived in the south and conquered Malacca .",
      "With the coming of European traders , Burma was once again an important trading centre , and Tabinshwehti moved his capital to Bago due to its strategic position for commerce . He then began assembling an army for an attack on coastal Rakhine State to the west . Tabinshwehtis forces were defeated at Arakan but he was able to gain control of Lower Burma up to Pyay . He led his retreating army eastward to the Ayutthaya Kingdom , where he was again defeated in the Burmese\u2013Siamese War ( 1547\u201349 ) . A period of unrest and rebellions among other conquered peoples followed and Tabinshwehti was assassinated in 1550 .",
      "Bayinnaungs Empire .",
      "Tabinshwehtis brother-in-law , Bayinnaung , succeeded to the throne in 1550 and reigned 30 years , launching a campaign of conquest invading several states , including Manipur ( 1560 ) and Ayutthaya ( 1564 ) . An energetic leader and effective military commander , he made Toungoo the most powerful state in Southeast Asia and extended his borders from Laos to Ayutthaya . Bayinnaung was poised to deliver a final , decisive assault on the kingdom of Arakan when he died in 1581 . His son Nanda Bayin and his successors were forced to quell rebellions in other parts of the kingdom , and the victory over Arakan was never achieved .",
      "Restored Taungoo .",
      "Faced with rebellion by several cities and renewed Portuguese incursions , the Toungoo rulers withdrew from southern Burma and founded a second dynasty at Ava , the Nyaungyan or Restored Taungoo Dynasty ( 1597\u20131752 ) . Bayinnaungs grandson , Anaukpetlun ( 1605\u20131628 ) , once again reunited Burma in 1613 and decisively defeated Portuguese attempts to take over Burma . Anaukpetluns successor Thalun ( 1629\u20131648 ) rebuilt the war torn country . Based on Thaluns revenue inquest in 1635 , the Irrawaddy valleys population was estimated to be around 2 million .",
      "The dynasty survived for another century and a half until the death of Mahadhammayaza in 1752 . Encouraged by the French in India , Bago finally rebelled against Inwa , further weakening the state , which fell in 1752 . The downfall of the Toungoo dynasty has been more broadly ascribed to institutional weaknesses in the capital , which intensified factionalism and succession disputes , and the uneven impact of growing trade and potential price inflation , on the elites income streams .",
      "Governance .",
      "During the Toungoo dynasty , the Burmese crown undertook a series of reforms that strengthened the stability and relative longevity of the dynasty . While the First Toungoo empire had established the precedent of stitching together independent kingdoms under a single monarch , Restored Toungoo monarchs more successfully subordinated lowland principalities under the Burmese thrones direct control . Senior princes of these principalities were required to live at the Burmese capital under close supervision , and the ceremonial insignia of these provincial rulers was downgraded . Other reforms included direct central control of provincial deputies , more effective links with provincial village chiefs , and expansion of the ahmudan system around the capital . Beginning in 1635 , the Burmese crown began to conduct comprehensive censuses , and consolidated access to provincial manpower and tax collections . The Burmese monkhood in Upper Burma was also subject to more effective personnel and financial regulations .",

      "Berga Naval Base ( ) is a naval base of the Swedish Navy located in the H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden fjard near Berga , Haninge Municipality . Today it is the home of the 4th Naval Warfare Flotilla , the 1st Marine Regiment and Home Guard unit S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn Group ( S\u00f6dert\u00f6rnsgruppen ) .",
      "History .",
      "In the late 1800s , the Swedish Navy began using H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden as a training area . Shooting warnings were read in the areas churches and a shooting target workshop was built in a bay on Vitsgarn opposite M\u00e4rsgarn at H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden . From 1904 , H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden began to be used more permanently as a base for the Coastal Fleets combat and signal schools and for naval mine training and more . In 1905 it was decided to set up a target depot for a combat school at Vitsgarn . The depot met a great need and grew steadily . From 1911 to 1921 , the Swedish state gradually acquired more land for the navy , including at western Vitsgarn . The experience of the navys preparedness and exercises during the World War I meant that the depot at H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden largely came to serve as an forward operating base for the entire mobilized part of the navy . Predecessors to the Artillery School at Berga were schools and training facilities on the islands of Alvsta L\u00e5ngholmar , Vitsgarn and M\u00e4rsgarn outside H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden . During World War I , target depots were developed and bridges and other facilities were built at M\u00e4rsgarn . The exercises on Horsfj\u00e4rden were intensified . Heavy artillery was now used and a few larger decommissioned ships were sunk as targets in H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden .",
      "Before the World War II , the navy began to consider moving the naval base in Stockholm off the inner waterways , but when the war broke out the navy had to settle for improving and expanding the existing archipelago facilities . During the war , H\u00e5rsfj\u00e4rden and the Musk\u00f6 area became the southern center of the archipelago surrounded by minefields and air defenses , as well as an outer and inner defense line of coastal batteries . The bay between Vitsgarn and M\u00e4rsgarn became an important naval port where seaplane and submarine facilities were built . In 1944 , the Riksdag decided that the Swedish state would acquire Berga Castle after the late and large landowner Helge Ax:son Johnson . The area included a strip of water that stretched from Vits\u00e5 harbor to N\u00e4ringsberg and was 3.5 km long and 800 meters wide . In addition to the strip , there was also a part of the area where Berga Agricultural School was located , with an area of 1,025 hectares . The purchase price for the acquisition of the property was SEK 2,635,000 . The coastal strip was divided into naval port and naval schools . The hunting ground was transformed into a training area . The Berga Naval Training Schools started operating in 1946 , then as the Swedish Navy Non-Commissioned Officers School ( Marinens underofficersskola , MUOS ) . The first wave of staff and families moved in . In V\u00e4sterhaninge a whole block was also built for the families of the navy .",
      "The Berga Naval Training Schools had the main task of training personnel , both conscripts and regular staff , in seamanship and basic military training . At the schools there was also some vocational training . The Berga Naval Training Schools were formed by relocating the training at Skeppsholmen in Stockholm to Berga . On 1 July 1946 , operations at Berga Naval Training Schools began with teaching in the Non-Commissioned Officers Schools chief mate and machinist programs , while the craftsmanship , economy and coastal artillery programs began on 1 October . On 21 October 1946 , His Royal Highness Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf performed the inauguration of the Swedish Navy Non-Commissioned Officers School . In the summer of 1949 , construction began on a facility for training in torpedo and submarine service . In 1948\u20131949 , the Submarine and ASW School ( Ub\u00e5ts- och ub\u00e5tsjaktskolan ) began training at Berga for both commanders and conscripts . Parts of the training were placed to the submarine training facility Valrossen . Following the Defence Act of 2004 , Berga Naval Base is the training ground for the 1st Marine Regiment and the location of the Home Guard unit S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn Group ( S\u00f6dert\u00f6rnsgruppen ) . From autumn 2008 the navy has also returned in the form of the 4th Naval Warfare Flotilla . With the Defence Act of 2004 , the Swedish Naval Schools ( \u00d6rlogsskolorna , \u00d6S ) was disbanded and replaced by the Swedish Naval Warfare Centre , with a main location in Karlskrona .",

      "Alliance of Small Island States",
      "Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) is an intergovernmental organization of low-lying coastal and small island countries . AOSIS was established in 1990 , ahead of the Second World Climate Conference . The main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of Small Island Developing States ( SIDS ) to address global warming .",
      "These island countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change and its related effects on the ocean , including sea level rise , coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion . Members among the nations least responsible for climate change , having contributed less than one percent to the worlds greenhouse gas emissions . These states advocate for international policy and mechanisms for addressing the inequity of climate impacts .",
      "Organization .",
      "AOSIS functions primarily as an ad hoc lobby and negotiating voice for SIDS through the United Nations ( UN ) system . It has no regular budget , permanent secretariat or formal charter . There is a Bureau , which is made up of the chair-person and two vice chairs .",
      "AOSIS also uses partnerships , for example with the United Nations Development Programme and the European Commission .",
      "Mission .",
      "AOSIS core focus areas are climate change , sustainable development and ocean conservation .",
      "SIDS are among the nations least responsible for climate change , having contributed less than one percent to the worlds greenhouse gas emissions . However , they are particularly vulnerable to its affects , with some islands even at risk of becoming uninhabitable due to sea level rise . AOSIS has consistently raised this threat of uninhabitability created by climate change in climate negotiations .",
      "SIDS , of which AOSIS is predominantly comprised , account for less than one percent of the global GDP , territory , and population , meaning that individually SIDS hold little political weight in international climate negotiations . The aim of AOSIS is to amplify the voices of its members by joining together states which face similar issues . This is to increase their ability to influence climate negotiations and raise awareness for its concerns .",
      "Actions .",
      "AOSIS has been very active from its inception . It has played a leading role in the global arena in raising awareness on climate change and advocating for action to address climate change . The creation of the alliance marked the beginning of the growth in influence of SIDS in climate politics . Despite their size and their relatively small economic and political weight , AOSIS member states have pulled above their weight in climate change negotiations .",
      "AOSIS played an important role in establishing the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) and was an important actor in the negotiations of the Framework in 1992 . Its advocacy was instrumental to the inclusion of references to the greater vulnerability and special needs of SIDS in Article 4.8 of the UNFCCC . However , AOSIS was unsuccessful in its attempts to persuade nations to include commitments to specified greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in the Framework .",
      "AOSIS continued to advocate for the special needs of SIDS during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and the \u2018special case\u2019 of SIDS was recognised in Agenda 21 , the political action plan which resulted from the Summit . AOSIS\u2019 proposal to create an \u2018international insurance fund\u2019 , funded by developed countries to compensate SIDS for damage caused by climate change , was turned down . In Rio , AOSIS broadened its mandate beyond climate change to also include the sustainable development of SIDS . AOSIS negotiated for the inclusion of a small program area on the sustainable development of small islands in Agenda 21 . However , Agenda 21 was not legally binding and some academics contend that the program was too vague to promote meaningful action .",
      "AOSIS did manage to secure the inclusion in Agenda 21 of a call for a global conference on this issue , which led to the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States , held in Barbados in 1994 . AOSIS played a prominent role at the Conference . It was the first UN conference entirely devoted to SIDS . The Conference resulted in the translation of Agenda 21 into a more comprehensive programme , the Barbados Programme of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States . However , the five year review of the Barbados Conference , conducted at a special session of the UN General Assembly in 1999 , found that the SIDS efforts to make progress towards sustainable development had been limited , while the ten year review of the Barbados Conference , which took the form of an international meeting in Mauritius in 2005 , found that its implementation was largely unsuccessful .",
      "AOSIS put forward the first draft text in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations as early as 1994 . AOSIS member states Fiji and Anitgua and Barbuda were the first states to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 .",
      "AOSIS has used formal and informal meetings scheduled in advance of UN climate change conferences to raise awareness and political momentum for its mission . AOSIS has also used the media to raise awareness for its concerns . For example , in the lead up to the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference ( UNFCCC ) in Copenhagen , members of the cabinet of the Maldives , an AOSIS member state , held an underwater cabinet meeting to create awareness of the threat that climate change poses to the very existence of the Maldives . The stunt garnered international attention .",
      "At the UN Climate Change Conference in Berlin in 1995 , AOSIS advocated very strongly for a commitment to timetables and target measures for climate change . It gained the support of developed nations including China , Brazil , and India . AOSIS had advocated since 2008 for the inclusion of a temperature target to restrain global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels . Many of the AOSIS member states were present at the Conference in Copenhagen . Democracy Now ! reported that members from the island state of Tuvalu interrupted a session of the Conference on 10 December 2009 to demand that global temperature rise be limited to 1.5 \u00b0C instead of the proposed 2 \u00b0C . This advocacy continued in the lead up to the 2015 UNFCCC in Paris . AOSIS initiated the negotiating agenda item which would lead to the inclusion of the 1.5 \u00b0C target and was important in gaining support for its inclusion from vulnerable African and Asian countries and LDC countries . According to writer and activist Mark Lynas , the inclusion of the 1.5 \u00b0C target in the Paris Agreement was almost entirely due to the advocacy of SIDS and other developing countries .",
      "At the 2013 Warsaw climate change conference , AOSIS pushed for the establishment of an international mechanism on loss and damages stressed by the wreckage of Supertyphoon Haiyan . As the existence of many AOSIS member states are put at risk by climate change , AOSIS has threatened lawsuits . The results of a recent review of the literature show that potential liability for climate change-related losses for AOSIS is over $570 trillion . AOSIS raised this issue again at the 2015 UNFCCC in Paris . AOSIS was instrumental in the inclusion of Article 8 in the Paris Agreement , which \u2018recognizes the importance of averting , minimizing and addressing loss and damage\u2019 caused by climate change , although the article does not \u2018provide a basis for any liability of compensation\u2019 . As in previous climate agreements , AOSIS members were among the first to ratify the Paris Agreement , with Fiji ratifying first , followed days later by the Republic of Marshall Islands , Palau , the Maldives , and others .",
      "AOSIS member state Fiji co-hosted the UN Oceans Conference in 2017 . Ministers from AOSIS member states , including Fiji , Tuvalu , and Palau used this conference to again raise awareness of the real risk that the impact of climate change poses to the very existence of their nations and to advocate for action to address climate change . Fiji also presided over the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference , making it the first SIDS to preside over a UN conference on climate change , although the event took place in Bonn due to Fijis remote location , small size and limited infrastructure .",
      "AOSIS membership .",
      "AOSIS has a membership of 39 states from all around the world , of which 37 are members of the UN while 2 ( Cook Islands and Niue ) participate within the UN , and an additional five states are observers . The alliance represents 28% of the developing countries , and 20% of the UNs total membership . Most SIDS are AOSIS members .",
      "AOSIS has a heterogeneous membership . Member states are spread across many different global regions . AOSIS focus is SIDS , however its membership also includes low-lying coastal countries , for example Belize and Guyana , and larger islands , for example Papua New Guinea . As well as geographical differences , the member nations also vary economically , as AOSIS includes both wealthy member nations , for example Singapore , and LDC countries , for example Comoros .",
      "The common factor which unites AOSIS members is their particular vulnerability to climate change .",
      "Some academics contend that AOSIS\u2019 heterogeneity has weakened it effectiveness , particularly in regard to its lobbying for sustainable development .",
      "AOSIS member states .",

      "Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107",
      "Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 ( , ; born 29 November 1946 ) is a Serbian writer and politician . He is the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement , and served as the Deputy Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of both Serbia and Montenegro and Serbia from 2006 to 2007 .",
      "He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law in 1968 . From 1969-80 he worked as a journalist in the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug .",
      "He was a member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and worked as the chief of staff of the Yugoslav President Mika \u0160piljak .",
      "Early life and career .",
      "Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 was born in the small village of Medja in the Banat region to a family of settlers from Herzegovina . He was three months old when his mother , Stoja Nikitovi\u0107 , died .",
      "His father , Vidak , remarried and had two more sons - Rodoljub and Dragan ; and three daughters - Radmila , Tanja and Ljiljana with Dara Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 , meaning that young Vuk grew up with five half-siblings .",
      "Shortly after Vuks birth , the entire family went back to Herzegovina where he finished primary school in the village of Slivlje . He graduated high school in Gacko .",
      "At his fathers insistence , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 considered studying medicine in Sarajevo ; however , the city was too uptight and cramped for his liking , so he went to study law in Belgrade instead .",
      "In 1968 , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 participated in anti-bureaucratic student revolts in Yugoslavia . After Josip Broz Tito promised reforms , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 initiated people to dance the Kozara\u010dko kolo at the Faculty of Law . Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 was a member of the Communist Youth Organization and later joined the League of Communists of Yugoslavia .",
      "Between 1969-78 , he was involved with journalism . He first worked for the state news agency Tanjug as its African correspondent stationed in Lusaka , Zambia . He was discharged from his post after publishing misleading information regarding the Rhodesian Bush War , creating a diplomatic incident .",
      "He then took a job as press adviser to the Yugoslav Union of Trade Unions ( Savez Sindikata Jugoslavije ) and then became editor-in-chief of Rad , a trade union paper . During his time as press adviser , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 spent some time as the personal secretary to the organisations president Mika \u0160piljak .",
      "In 1981 , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 published his first novel Sudije ( Judges ) which described a judge resisting political pressure .",
      "In 1982 , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 was expelled from the Communist party after he published his second novel No\u017e ( Knife ) . The novel tells the story of a man who is raised as a Bosnian Muslim who comes to believe that Serbs killed his family , only to later learn that his ethnic heritage is Serbian and that his adoptive family was guilty of murdering his birth-family . The book caused controversy as it reignited divisive ethno-nationalist issues which Tito and the Communist Party tried to suppress . The party condemned and subsequently banned the book , which was also published in English . The book was made into a movie in 1999 entitled The Dagger or The Knife in English .",
      "His novels Molitva 1\u20132 ( Prayer 1\u20132 , 1985 ) and Ruski konsul ( Russian consul , 1988 ) also explored the suffering of Serbs during World War II , while No\u0107 generala ( The Generals Nights ) published in 1994 dealt with Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107s last days .",
      "Political career .",
      "In March 1989 , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 along with Mirko Jovi\u0107 and Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj founded the Sava Association . The group dedicated itself to the protection of the Serbian language and the defense of Kosovo and Metohija . In the late 1980s , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 was in agreement with \u0160e\u0161eljs sentiments about deporting Albanians from Kosovo and suggested that a special fund was needed to finance the repopulation of Kosovo by Serbs . However , Jovi\u0107 , \u0160e\u0161elj and Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 soon found themselves at political crossroads and their party disintegrated in three pieces . The Sava Association turned into the Serbian National Renewal Party under the leadership of Jovi\u0107 in January 1990 . Meanwhile , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 founded the Serbian Renewal Movement ( Srpski Pokret Obnove , SPO ) , a democratic nationalist party in March and \u0160e\u0161elj created his Serbian Radical Party in February 1991 .",
      "On 26 September 1990 , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 declared that his armed volunteers would be willing to defend Krajina Serbs while three days later in an interview with Delo , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 stated : Serbia must obtain all territories in what is today Herzegovina , Bosnia , Slavonia , Dalmatia , in these parts of Croatia where the Serbs made a majority of the population until 6 April 1941 , when the Ustasha genocide against them began...Wherever the Serb blood was shed by the Ustashas knives , wherever there are our graves there are our borders . Also he claim that most of Muslims are burdened with Serbian origin and that they run away from themselves because they know that they are Orthodox and Serbs . The Serbian Renewal Movement ( SPO ) participated in the first post-communist democratic elections , held on 9 December 1990 , but finished a distant second amidst the total blackout from the pro-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 state media . Following that failure Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 kept the pressure on Serbian President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 via street protests , organizing mass demonstrations in Belgrade on 9 March 1991 . The police intervened , and clashed with demonstrators with some damage to public buildings resulting in the Yugoslav Peoples Army having to be brought in . Clashes between police and protesters resulted in two deaths , one student and one officer and injuries to over 200 people . Demonstrations ended after the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government agreed to concessions .",
      "Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 became a leading opponent of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 . His fiery oratory skills and emotional speeches earned him the monicker Czar of the Streets .",
      "While Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 was a nationalist , he also held pro-Western and anti-war views . His plan was to rapidly transform the biggest and most populous part of Yugoslavia ( Serbia ) according to Western standards so that the eventual international involvement in solving Yugoslav crisis would turn in Serbian favour and produce a peaceful solution . His ideological opponents often cite his strong nationalist feelings ( attempting rehabilitation of Serb-nationalist Chetniks ) as contrarian to his insistence on peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis . Political opponents have claimed Dra\u0161kovi\u0107s political engagement at this early stage of his political career was full of inconsistencies and seemingly diametrically opposing views and actions . However , according to Draskovic , his ( and that of his party ) pro-Western peaceful stance , has never wavered since the start of the political crisis in Yugoslavia . He insisted that Serbian government should promote radical democratic shift , renew traditional alliances with Western nations ( including entry into NATO ) as a way to preserve some form of Yugoslav confederation rather than pursue direct confrontation with the Croats .",
      "His party SPO organized a paramilitary unit called the Serbian Guard led by former criminals such as \u0110or\u0111e Gi\u0161ka Bo\u017eovi\u0107 and Branislav Beli Mati\u0107 , with Bo\u017eovi\u0107 dying in Croatia in October 1991 . Mati\u0107 was killed by the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 secret police in April 1991 . And although Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 initially claimed this militia was an incitement to Serbian authorities to form a non-ideological and a national armed force outside of Yugoslav Peoples Army , he eventually distanced himself from the paramilitary formation altogether .",
      "According to historian Dubravka Stojanovi\u0107 , while Dra\u0161kovi\u0107s anti-war views were sincere , he also supported a nationalist program little different in its goals to that of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 , and he and his party was never able to reconcile these opposing currents .",
      "His anti-war views came to the fore in mid to late 1991 , particularly in November of that year when he wrote a passionate condemnation of the bloody siege of Vukovar in a Serbian daily Borba .",
      "In early 1992 , he called on all citizens of Bosnia to reject nationalism . In 1993 , he and his wife Danica were arrested , beaten and sent to a high-security prison following street riots in Belgrade . Only his hunger strike , and international outrage pressured the Yugoslav government to release the couple .",
      "In 1996 , SPO formed the opposition alliance Zajedno ( Together ) with the Democratic Party of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 and the Civic Alliance of Serbia under Vesna Pe\u0161i\u0107 , which achieved major successes in the local elections in November that same year before splitting .",
      "Dra\u0161kovi\u0107s SPO participated on its own at the September 1997 election , boycotted by his former partners despite an array of local electronic media outlets being in opposition hands .",
      "In January 1999 , SPO , a parliamentary party , was asked to join a coalition with Milo\u0161evi\u0107s Socialist Party of Serbia as tension with US and NATO increased in order to use his influence with Western politicians . In early 1999 , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 became the deputy prime minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . He did so in response to Milo\u0161evi\u0107s appeal for national unity in the face of Albanian uprising in Kosovo and a looming confrontation with NATO . He was sacked by the Prime Minister Momir Bulatovi\u0107 on 28 April 1999 .",
      "A failed attempt at assassinating Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 took place on 3 October 1999 on the Ibar highway when four of his close associates were murdered , and on 15 June 2000 in Budva .",
      "In 2005 , Milorad Ulemek was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the murder of \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 and Ivan Stamboli\u0107 and the assassination attempt on Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 in 2000 .",
      "Post-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 .",
      "In what he himself later termed a bad political move , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 kept his SPO out of the wide anti-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 Democratic Opposition of Serbia ( DOS ) coalition that formed in 2000 , meaning that his candidate in the 24 September 2000 federal presidential elections , Vojislav Mihailovi\u0107 , achieved little success and that SPO also was not successful in the subsequent parliamentary election where the DOS won overwhelmingly . Because of this , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 and his party were marginalized over the next three years .",
      "In the fall of 2002 , he attempted a comeback as one of the eleven candidates in the Serbian presidential elections , which were subsequently unsuccessful due to low turnout . Despite a polished marketing campaign that saw Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 change his personal appearance and tone down his fiery rhetoric , he ended up with only 4.5% of the total vote , well behind Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica ( 31.2% ) and Miroljub Labus ( 27.7% ) , both of whom moved on to the second-round runoff .",
      "His next chance for political redemption came in late 2003 . Fully aware of SPOs , as well as his own , weak political standing after more than 3 years in political oblivion , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 entered his party into a pre-election coalition with New Serbia ( NS ) , thus reuniting with old party colleague Velimir Ili\u0107 . Joining forces for the 2003 parliamentary election , they achieved limited success , but more importantly managed to get into the coalition that formed the minority government ( along with DSS , G17 Plus ) , providing it with critical parliamentary seats to keep the far-right radicals ( SRS ) at bay .",
      "In the subsequent division of power , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 received the high-ranking position of Serbia and Montenegros foreign minister , a position he held until May 2007 . In response to Montenegros vote for independence , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 called for a restoration of Serbias monarchy : This is an historic moment for Serbia itself , a beginning which would be based on the historically-proven and victorious pillars of the Serbian state and I am talking about the pillars of a kingdom .",
      "In August 2010 , Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 argued in favour of changing the Serbian Constitution of 2006 to remove references to Kosovo as a part of Serbia because according to him Serbia has no national sovereignty over Kosovo whatsoever . All of Serbia knows that Kosovo is not really a province within Serbia , that it is completely beyond the control of the government and the state of Serbia .",

      "First Air Group",
      "First Air Group ( , E 1 ) , previously named Air Group ( ) and later named Attack Group ( ) was an air group unit in the Swedish Air Force . The First Air Group was the collective name given to the attack wings who would jointly carry out heavier attacks in the event of war . It was active in various formations from 1938 to 1995 . It was directly subordinate to the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces and therefore nicknamed \u00d6B:s klubba ( Supreme Commanders club ) .",
      "Naming .",
      "Since its foundation in 1926 the Swedish Air Force grouped its aircraft into Flygk\u00e5r ( Air Corps , like the F\u00f6rsta flygk\u00e5ren , Andra flygk\u00e5ren , Tredje flygk\u00e5ren - the First , the Second , the Third Air Corps etc. ) , this being the aviation equivalent of an army regiment . In 1936 the Swedish Air Force switched from army-like to navy-like naming of its flying units . Thus the air corps became flying flotillas ( flygflottiljer , sing . flygflottilj ) with the respective geographic region added as an official name , thus the Second Air Corps ( Andra Flygk\u00e5r ) established in 1926 became the Second Royal Roslagen Flying Flotilla ( Andra Kungliga Roslagens Flygflottilj ) in 1936 . Following the naval nomenclature these flying flotillas were further divided into divisions ( divisioner , sing . division ) like the navys destroyer divisions .",
      "In the end of 1938 the Swedish Air Force formed an air squadron ( Flygeskadern ) in the end of 1938 . In 1942 it became the First Air Squadron ( E1 F\u00f6rsta Flygeskadern ) , with the Second and Third to follow in 1943 and the Fourth in 1945 . So the traditional Swedish naming of air units is as follows :",
      "- Eskader or Flygeskader - USAF Air Division or RAF Air Group equivalent",
      "- Flottilj or Flygflottilj - USAF Air Wing or RAF Station equivalent",
      "- Division - Air Squadron",
      "- Grupp - Flight",
      "History .",
      "According to the Defence Act of 1936 , an air group commander would in case of war carry out the immediate command of the Swedish Air Force units that were part of the air group . In peacetime , his duties were to plan exercises , inspect wing exercises and conduct co-exercises and major practical exercises , that is , not to have constant command of Swedish Air Force wings . Flygeskadern ( the Air Group ) was organized in response to the emergency preparedness in September 1939 and was resolved ( except for the staff ) in the latter part of 1940 . According to the Defence Act of 1942 , four air groups would be permanently organized and in peacetime command the constituent wings regarding tactical and operational exercises . Its staff was located in Karlsborg from 1939 to 1942 . In 1942 the Swedish Air Force expanded its war organization into four air groups and the Air Group was renamed First Air Group ( F\u00f6rsta flygeskadern , E 1 ) , with its staff in Stockholm . The distribution of the Swedish Air Force wings to the air groups varied from 1 July 1945 , when all four air groups had been organized . The First Air Group had attack duties , the Second and Third Air Group had fighter duties and the Fourth Air Group had reconnaissance duties .",
      "The staff were merged with the staff of the Western Airbase Area ( V\u00e4stra flygbasomr\u00e5det , Flybo V ) on 1 October 1957 and was placed in Gothenburg . This air group was meant to have attack duties . Its command center Bj\u00f6rn , was located south of Skara . In 1966 the First Air Group became the only air group in the Swedish Air Force , when the three others were decommissioned . The commander of the First Air Group was subordinate to the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces according to instruction by the King in Council . Issues concerning unit training and production , the commander of the First Air Group was subordinate to the Chief of the Air Force . The First Air Group was then renamed Attackeskadern ( Attack Group ) and was led by a joint staff based in Gothenburg until it was decommissioned in 1995 . The decommissioning decision came in conjunction with the Defence Act of 1992 , in which it was decided that three geographic air commands were to be established on 1 July 1993 and subsequently retrieved the duties from the First Air Group . At the decommissioning , the traditions and history of the First Air Group were transferred to the Chief of Air Force Staff , which on 30 June 1998 handed them over to the Air Force Center .",
      "Commanding officers .",
      "Between 1938 and 1941 and 1994 to 1995 the commander had the rank of colonel . Between 1941 and 1994 , the commander had the rank of major general .",

He is best known for portraying fictional secret agent James Bond in the Eon Productions film series , playing the character in seven feature films between 1973 and 1985 . Moore was the third actor in the role , and his seven appearances as Bond , from Live and Let Die to A View to a Kill , are the most of any actor in the Eon-produced entries .",
      "On television , Moore played the lead role of Simon Templar , the title character in the British television series The Saint ( 1962\u20131969 ) . He also had roles in some American television shows and films in the late 1950s and early 1960s , including replacing James Garner and portraying Beau Maverick in the Maverick series ( 1960\u20131961 ) . Moore starred with Tony Curtis in The Persuaders ! television series from 1971 to 1972 , and had roles in several theatrical films in the 1970s and 1980s .",
      "Moore was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1991 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for services to charity . In 2007 , he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry . In 2008 , the government of France made him a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters .",
      "Early life .",
      "Roger Moore was born on 14 October 1927 in Stockwell , London . He was the only child of George Alfred Moore ( 1904\u20131997 ) , a policeman ( PC168E based in Bow Street , London ) , and Lillian Lily ( Pope ; 1904\u20131986 ) . His mother was born in Calcutta , India , to an English family . He attended Battersea Grammar School , but was evacuated to Holsworthy in Devon during the Second World War , and attended Launceston College in Cornwall . He was further educated at Dr Challoners Grammar School in Amersham , Buckinghamshire .",
      "Moore was apprenticed to an animation studio , but was fired after he made a mistake with some animation cels . When his father investigated a robbery at the home of film director Brian Desmond Hurst , Moore was introduced to the director and hired as an extra for the 1945 film Caesar and Cleopatra . While there , Moore attracted an off-camera female fan following , and Hurst decided to pay Moores fees at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art . Moore spent three terms at RADA , where he was a classmate of his future Bond co-star Lois Maxwell , the original Miss Moneypenny . During his time there , he developed the Mid-Atlantic accent and relaxed demeanour that became his screen persona .",
      "At 18 , shortly after the end of the Second World War , Moore was conscripted for national service . On 21 September 1946 , he was commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps as a second lieutenant . He was given the service number 372394 . He was an officer in the Combined Services Entertainment section , eventually becoming a captain commanding a small depot in West Germany . There he looked after entertainers for the armed forces passing through Hamburg .",
      "Career .",
      "Early work ( 1945\u20131953 ) .",
      "Moore had some early uncredited appearances in Perfect Strangers , Caesar and Cleopatra ( both 1945 ) , Gaiety George , Piccadilly Incident ( both 1946 ) , and Trottie True ( 1949 ) appearing alongside an uncredited Christopher Lee ( both actors being cast by Brian Desmond Hurst as stage-door Johnnies ) .",
      "In his book Last Man Standing : Tales from Tinseltown , Moore states that his first television appearance was on 27 March 1949 in The Governess by Patrick Hamilton , a live broadcast ( as usual in that era ) , in which he played the minor part of Bob Drew . Other actors in the show included Clive Morton and Betty Ann Davies . He had uncredited parts in films including Paper Orchid and The Interrupted Journey ( both 1949 ) . He was in Drawing-Room Detective on TV and appeared in the films One Wild Oat and Honeymoon Deferred ( both 1951 ) .",
      "In the early 1950s Moore worked as a model , appearing in print advertisements in the UK for knitwear ( earning him the nickname The Big Knit ) and a wide range of other products such as toothpaste .",
      "Moore travelled to the United States and began to work in television . He appeared in adaptations of Julius Caesar and Black Chiffon , and in two episodes of Robert Montgomery Presents , as well as the TV movie The Clay of Kings ( all 1953 ) .",
      "MGM ( 1954\u20131956 ) .",
      "In March 1954 , MGM signed Moore to a seven-year contract . He started his MGM contract with a small role in The Last Time I Saw Paris ( 1954 ) , flirting with Elizabeth Taylor . He appeared in Interrupted Melody , a biographical movie about opera singer Marjorie Lawrences recovery from polio , in which he was billed third under Glenn Ford and Eleanor Parker as Lawrences brother Cyril . That same year , he played a supporting role in the swashbuckler The Kings Thief starring Ann Blyth , Edmund Purdom , David Niven and George Sanders .",
      "In the 1956 film Diane , Moore was billed third again , this time under Lana Turner and Pedro Armendariz , in a 16th-century period piece set in France with Moore playing Prince Henri , the future king . Moore was released from his MGM contract after two years following the films critical and commercial failure . In his own words , At MGM , RGM [ Roger George Moore ] was NBG [ no bloody good ] .",
      "Moore then freelanced for a time , appearing in episodes of Ford Star Jubilee ( 1956 ) , Lux Video Theatre ( 1957 ) and Matinee Theatre ( 1957 ) .",
      "Ivanhoe ( 1958\u20131959 ) .",
      "Moores first success was playing the eponymous hero , Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe , in the 1958\u201359 series Ivanhoe , a loose adaptation of the 1819 romantic novel by Sir Walter Scott set in the 12th century during the era of Richard the Lionheart , delving into Ivanhoes conflict with Prince John . Shot mainly in England at Elstree Studios and Buckinghamshire , some of the show was also filmed in California owing to a partnership with Columbia Studios Screen Gems . Aimed at younger audiences , the pilot was filmed in colour , a reflection of its comparatively high budget for a British childrens adventure series of the period , but subsequent episodes were shot in black and white . Christopher Lee and John Schlesinger were among the shows guest stars , and series regulars included Robert Brown ( who in the 1980s played M in several James Bond films ) as the squire Gurth , Peter Gilmore as Waldo Ivanhoe , Andrew Keir as villainous Prince John , and Bruce Seton as noble King Richard . Moore suffered broken ribs and a battle-axe blow to his helmet while performing some of his own stunts filming a season of 39 half-hour episodes , and later reminisced , I felt a complete Charlie riding around in all that armour and damned stupid plumed helmet . I felt like a medieval fireman .",
      "Warner Bros . ( 1959\u20131961 ) .",
      "After that , he spent a few years mainly doing one-shot parts in television series , including an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents in 1959 titled The Avon Emeralds . He signed another long-term contract to a studio , this time to Warner Bros .",
      "In 1959 , he took the lead role in The Miracle , a version of the play Das Mirakel for Warner Bros . showcasing Carroll Baker as a nun . The part had been turned down by Dirk Bogarde . That same year , Moore was directed by Arthur Hiller in The Angry Young Man , an episode of the television series The Third Man starring Michael Rennie as criminal mastermind Harry Lime , the role portrayed by Orson Welles in the film version .",
      "The Alaskans ( 1959\u20131960 ) .",
      "Moores next television series involved playing the lead as Silky Harris for the ABC/Warner Bros . 1959\u201360 Western The Alaskans , with co-stars Dorothy Provine as Rocky , Jeff York as Reno , and Ray Danton as Nifty . The show ran for a single season of 37 hour-long episodes on Sunday nights . Though set in Skagway , Alaska , with a focus on the Klondike Gold Rush around 1896 , the series was filmed in the hot studio lot at Warner Bros . in Hollywood with the cast costumed in fur coats and hats . Moore found the work highly taxing and his off-camera affair with Provine complicated matters even more .",
      "He subsequently appeared as the questionable character 14 Karat John in the two-part episode Right Off the Boat of the ABC/WB crime drama The Roaring 20s , with Rex Reason , John Dehner , Gary Vinson , and Dorothy Provine , appearing in a similar role , but with a different character name .",
      "Maverick ( 1960\u20131961 ) .",
      "In the wake of The Alaskans , Moore was cast as Beau Maverick , an English-accented cousin of frontier gamblers Bret Maverick ( James Garner ) , Bart Maverick ( Jack Kelly ) , and Brent Maverick ( Robert Colbert ) in the much more successful ABC/WB Western series Maverick . Sean Connery was flown over from Britain to test for the part , but turned it down .",
      "Moore appeared as the character in 14 episodes after Garner had left the series at the end of the previous season , wearing some of Garners costumes ; while filming The Alaskans he had already recited much of Garners dialogue , for the Alaskan series frequently recycled Maverick scripts , changing only the names and locales . He had also filmed a Maverick episode with Garner two seasons earlier , in which Moore played a different character , in a retooling of Richard Brinsley Sheridans 1775 comedy of manners play The Rivals . In the course of the story , Moore and Garners characters switched names on a bet , with Moore consequently identifying himself as Bret Maverick through most of the episode .",
      "Moores debut as Beau Maverick occurred in the first episode of the 1960\u201361 fourth season , The Bundle from Britain , one of four episodes in which he shared screen time with cousin Bart ( Jack Kelly ) . Robert Altman wrote and directed Bolt from the Blue , an episode featuring Will Hutchins as a frontier lawyer similar to his character in the series Sugarfoot , and Red Dog found Beau mixed up with vicious bank robbers Lee Van Cleef and John Carradine . Kathleen Crowley was Moores leading lady in two episodes ( Bullet for the Teacher and Kiz ) , and others included Mala Powers , Roxane Berard , Fay Spain , Merry Anders , Andra Martin , and Jeanne Cooper . Upon leaving the series , Moore cited a decline in script quality since the Garner era as the key factor in his decision to depart ; ratings for the show were also down . Moore was originally slated to appear with both Jack Kelly and Robert Colbert in the series but by the time Colbert starred in his first episode , Moore had already left the series . Numerous early publicity stills of Kelly , Moore and Colbert posing together exist , however .",
      "Moore was still under contract with Warners , who cast him in The Sins of Rachel Cade ( 1961 ) , making love to a nun played by Angie Dickinson , and Gold of the Seven Saints ( 1961 ) , supporting Clint Walker . He went to Italy to make Romulus and the Sabines ( 1961 ) .",
      "The Saint ( 1962\u20131969 ) .",
      "Lew Grade cast Moore as Simon Templar in a new adaptation of The Saint , based on the novels by Leslie Charteris . Moore said in an interview in 1963 that he wanted to buy the rights to Leslie Charteriss character and the trademarks . The television series was broadcast by ITV in the UK between 1962 and 1969 , and its overseas success made Moore a household name . After the strong performance in the US of the first two series in first-run syndication , NBC picked up the show in 1966 . By early 1967 , Moore had achieved international stardom . The series established his suave , quipping style which he carried forward to James Bond , and also saw him exhibit his trademark raised eyebrow . Francis Blagburn in The Telegraph writes ,",
      "The Saint ran from 1962 for six series and 118 episodes . Moore went on to direct nine episodes of the later series , which moved into colour in 1967 . Several episodes were edited together to form the films , The Saint and the Fiction Makers ( 1968 ) and Vendetta for the Saint ( 1969 ) .",
      "Post-Saint films and The Persuaders ! ( 1969\u20131972 ) .",
      "He made two films immediately after the series ended : Crossplot ( 1969 ) , a lightweight spy caper movie , and the more challenging The Man Who Haunted Himself ( 1970 ) . Directed by Basil Dearden , it gave Moore the opportunity to demonstrate greater versatility than the role of Simon Templar had allowed . In 2004 , Moore said of The Man Who Haunted Himself : It was one of the few times I was allowed to act.. . Many say my best role was in The Man Who Haunted Himself . Being a modest actor , I wont disagree .",
      "Lew Grade lured Moore to star alongside Tony Curtis in The Persuaders! . The show featured the adventures of two millionaire playboys across Europe . Moore was paid the then-unheard-of sum of \u00a31 million for a single series , making him the highest-paid television actor in the world . Lew Grade claimed in his autobiography Still Dancing , that Moore and Curtis didnt hit it off all that well . Curtis refused to spend more time on set than was strictly necessary , while Moore was always willing to work overtime . According to the DVD commentary , neither Roger Moore , an uncredited co-producer , nor Robert S . Baker , the credited producer , ever had a contract other than a handshake with Lew Grade .",
      "Despite its focus on the UK and US markets , The Persuaders ! became more successful in other international markets . On its premiere on the ITV network , it was beaten in the ratings by repeats of Monty Pythons Flying Circus on BBC One . It did however place in the Top 20 most-viewed television series in the UK throughout 1971 . The lack of success in the US , where it had been sold to ABC , Curtis put down to its showing at the Saturday 10pm slot , but it was successful in continental Europe and Australia . In Germany , where the series was aired under the name Die Zwei ( The Two ) , it became a hit through especially amusing dubbing which only barely used translations of the original dialogue .",

      "Live and Let Die ( 1973 ) .",
      "Owing to his commitment to several television shows , in particular The Saint , Roger Moore was unavailable for the James Bond films for a considerable time . His participation in The Saint was as actor , producer , and director , and he also became involved in developing the series The Persuaders! . In 1964 , he made a guest appearance as James Bond in the comedy series Mainly Millicent . Moore stated in his autobiography My Word Is My Bond ( 2008 ) that he had neither been approached to play the character in Dr . No , nor did he feel that he had ever been considered . Only after Sean Connery had declared in 1966 that he would not play Bond any longer did Moore become aware that he might be a contender for the role . After George Lazenby was cast in 1969s On Her Majestys Secret Service and Connery was enticed back to the role of Bond again for Diamonds Are Forever ( 1971 ) , Moore did not consider the possibility until it seemed clear that Connery had stepped down as Bond for good . At that point , Moore was approached , and he accepted producer Albert Broccolis offer in August 1972 . In his autobiography , Moore writes that he had to cut his hair and lose weight for the role . Although he resented having to make those changes , he was finally cast as James Bond in Live and Let Die ( 1973 ) .",
      "Moore then made Gold ( 1974 ) , based on a novel by Wilbur Smith for producer Michael Klinger and director Peter R . Hunt ( who had an editing role in the first five Bond films and directed On Her Majestys Secret Service ) . He was paid US$200,000 plus a percentage of the profits .",
      "The Man with the Golden Gun ( 1974 ) .",
      "Moore made his second Bond film , The Man with the Golden Gun ( 1974 ) , which was a hit , though less successful than Live and Let Die . It featured Christopher Lee as the main antagonist . Also appearing are Britt Ekland , Herve Villechaize , and Maud Adams . He then made a comedy That Lucky Touch ( 1975 ) which was a box office disaster . Moore made an Italian-shot action film Street People ( 1976 ) , then went back to South Africa for another Klinger-Hunt movie from a Wilbur Smith novel , Shout at the Devil ( 1976 ) , which was successful in Britain , though less so in the US . Lee Marvin was a main cast member . Ian Holm was also featured , as well as Barbara Parkins .",
      "The Spy Who Loved Me ( 1977 ) .",
      "Moore returned for a third outing as Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me ( 1977 ) , which was a massive box-office success . It also starred Barbara Bach , and Richard Kiel in his first appearance as the villain , Jaws . He returned to South Africa for a third action movie shot there , The Wild Geese ( 1978 ) , produced by Euan Lloyd and directed by Andrew V . McLaglen . It was a sizeable hit in Britain and Europe but , like Shout at the Devil , less so in the US . The cast featured Richard Burton , who had top billing , and Richard Harris .",
      "Moore played the lead in Escape to Athena ( 1979 ) partly financed by Lew Grade . It was a heist adventure set in war-time Greece , and stars Telly Savalas and David Niven , and features mostly American character actors , including Elliott Gould , Stefanie Powers , Richard Roundtree , Sonny Bono , and Italian actress Claudia Cardinale . Roger Moore ( with top billing ) plays a charming former Austrian antiquities dealer turned crooked camp commandant , asked to guard Greek antiquities desired by the Third Reich , and also guard the collection of archaeologists who are being forced to work to find and recover these objects , but he has other plans for the treasure he guards and for the people under his watch .",
      "Moonraker ( 1979 ) .",
      "With the success of his fourth outing as Bond , Moonraker ( 1979 ) , Moore followed it with an action film North Sea Hijack ( 1980 ) where Moore played a very un-Bond-like hero , opposite Anthony Perkins . The film was a box-office disappointment .",
      "Better received was The Sea Wolves ( 1980 ) , another World War Two adventure which reunited many of the crew from The Wild Geese including Euan Lloyd and McLaglen . It was based on the true story of a March 1943 event in British India and Portuguese Goa , in which a group of retired members of the Calcutta Light Horse , coloneled by David Nivens character , assist regular British Army operatives , played by Moore and Gregory Peck , in destroying German ships in neutral Mormugao harbor , all the time surrounded by German spies and Indian nationalist intrigue . Trevor Howard , Patrick Macnee , and Barbara Kellerman also co-star , with a whos who lineup of British character actors .",
      "Moore was in two all-star comedies : Sunday Lovers ( 1980 ) , which flopped at the box office , and The Cannonball Run ( 1981 ) , which was a hit . The latter featured an ensemble cast , including Jackie Chan , Burt Reynolds , Dean Martin , Dom DeLuise , Sammy Davis Jr , and Farrah Fawcett .",

      "Octopussy ( 1983 ) .",
      "Following the film , For Your Eyes Only , Moore expressed a desire to leave the role , and other actors were screen tested including James Brolin , but Moore was eventually enticed back for Octopussy ( 1983 ) .",
      "The circumstances around Octopussys release were highly unusual in that another James Bond film was being released in the same year . The Non-Eon production Never Say Never Again which featured his predecessor Sean Connery returning to the role of Bond , although not canon to his previous Eon Bond films . This led to the media dubbing the one-time situation the Battle of the Bonds .",
      "He made a cameo as Chief Inspector Clouseau , posing as a famous movie star , in Curse of the Pink Panther ( 1983 ) ( for which he was credited as Turk Thrust II ) . Then he tried a thriller The Naked Face ( 1984 ) , written and directed by Bryan Forbes .",
      "A View to a Kill ( 1985 ) .",
      "Moore starred in his final Bond film , A View to a Kill ( 1985 ) . Moore was the oldest actor to have played Bond \u2013 he was 45 in Live and Let Die , and 58 when he announced his retirement on 3 December 1985 , having played the part for over 12 years . With 7 films Moore currently holds the record for playing Bond the most times in the Eon series but is tied with Sean Connery in number of times playing the character when counting Connerys non-Eon appearance in Never Say Never Again ( 1983 ) .",
      "Moores Bond was very different from the version created by Ian Fleming . Screenwriters such as George MacDonald Fraser provided scenarios in which Moore was cast as a seasoned , debonair playboy who would always have a trick or gadget in stock when he needed it . This was designed to serve the contemporary taste of the 1970s . Moores version of Bond was also known for his sense of humour and witty one liners as Moore himself said , My personality is different from previous Bonds . Im not that cold-blooded-killer type . Which is why I play it mostly for laughs .",

At the age of 73 , he played a flamboyant homosexual man in Boat Trip ( 2002 ) with Cuba Gooding Jr .",
      "The British satirical puppet show Spitting Image had a sketch in which their latex likeness of Moore , when asked to display emotions by an offscreen director , did nothing but raise an eyebrow ; Moore himself stated that he thought the sketch was funny and took it in good humour . Indeed , he had always embraced the eyebrows gag wholeheartedly , and quipped that he only had three expressions as Bond : right eyebrow raised , left eyebrow raised , and eyebrows crossed when grabbed by Jaws . Spitting Image continued the joke , featuring a Bond film spoof , The Man with the Wooden Delivery , with Moores puppet receiving orders from Margaret Thatcher to kill Mikhail Gorbachev . Other comedy shows at that time ridiculed Moores acting , with Rory Bremner once claiming to have had a death threat from one of his irate fans following one such routine .",
      "In a nod to his 1960s TV show Moore had a vocal cameo in The Saint ( 1997 ) as a radio newsreader as Simon Templar drives away at the end of the film . In the year 2000 , Moore played the role of a secret agent in the Christmas special Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings , shown on BBC One on Christmas Day .

      "Dorothy Squires .",
      "In 1952 , Moore met the Welsh singer Dorothy Squires , who was 12 years his senior , and Van Steyn and Moore divorced the following year . Squires and Moore were married in New York . They lived in Bexley , Kent , after their wedding .",
      "They moved to the United States in 1954 to develop their careers , but tension developed in their marriage due to their age difference and Moores infatuation with starlet Dorothy Provine , and they moved back to the United Kingdom in 1961 , where they resided in The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield , near Birmingham . Squires suffered a series of miscarriages during their marriage , and Moore later said the outcome of their marriage might have been different if they had been able to have children .",
      "In their tempestuous relationship , Squires smashed a guitar over his head , and after learning of his affair with the Italian actress Luisa Mattioli , who became Moores third wife , Moore said , She threw a brick through my window . She reached through the glass and grabbed my shirt and she cut her arms doing it...The police came and they said , Madam , youre bleeding and she said , Its my heart thats bleeding . Squires intercepted letters from Mattioli to Moore and planned to include them in her autobiography , but the couple won injunctions against the publication in 1977 , which led Squires to unsuccessfully sue them for loss of earnings . The numerous legal cases launched by Squires led her to be declared a vexatious litigant in 1987 . Moore paid Squiress hospital bills after her cancer treatment in 1996 , Squires died in 1998 .",
      "Luisa Mattioli .",
      "In 1961 , while filming The Rape of the Sabine Women in Italy , Moore left Squires for the Italian actress Luisa Mattioli . Squires refused to accept their separation , and sued Moore for loss of conjugal rights , but Moore refused the courts order to return to Squires in 28 days . Squires also smashed windows at a house in France where Moore and Mattioli were living , and unsuccessfully sued actor Kenneth More for libel , as Kenneth More had introduced Moore and Mattioli at a charity event as Mr Roger Moore and his wife . Moore and Mattioli lived together until 1969 , when Squires finally granted him a divorce , after they had been separated for seven years . At Moores and Mattiolis marriage in April 1969 at the Caxton Hall in Westminster , London , a crowd of 600 people was outside , with women screaming his name .",
      "Moore had three children with Mattioli : actress-daughter Deborah ( born 1963 ) and two sons , Geoffrey and Christian . Geoffrey is also an actor , and appeared alongside his father in the films Sherlock Holmes in New York ( 1976 ) and Fire , Ice and Dynamite ( 1990 ) . In later life , he co-founded Hush Restaurant in Mayfair , London , with Jamie Barber . Geoffrey and his wife Loulou have two daughters . Moores younger son , Christian , is a film producer .",
      "Kristina Kiki Tholstrup .",
      "Moore and Mattioli separated in 1993 after Moore developed feelings for a Swedish-born Danish socialite , Kristina Kiki Tholstrup . Moore later described his prostate cancer diagnosis in 1993 as life-changing , which led him to reassess his life and marriage . Mattioli and Tholstrup had long been friends , but Mattioli was scathing of her in the book she subsequently wrote about her relationship with Moore , Nothing Lasts Forever , describing how she felt betrayed by Tholstrup and discarded by Moore .",
      "Moore remained silent on his divorce from Mattioli , later saying that he did not wish to hurt his children by engaging in a war of words . Moores children refused to speak to him for a period after the divorce , but they were later reconciled with their father . Mattioli refused to grant Moore a divorce until 2000 , when a \u00a310 million settlement was agreed . Moore subsequently married Tholstrup in 2002 . Moore said that he loved Tholstrup as she was organised , serene , loving , and calm , saying , I have a difficult life . I rely on Kristina totally . When we are travelling for my job , she is the one who packs . Kristina takes care of all that . Moore also said that his marriage to Tholstrup was a tranquil relationship , there are no arguments . Tholstrup had a daughter , Christina Knudsen , from a previous relationship ; Knudsen described her stepfather as a positive influence , saying , I was in difficult relationships but that all changed when her mother met Moore . Christina Knudsen died from cancer on 25 July 2016 , at the age of 47 ; Moore posted on Twitter , We are heartbroken and We were all with her , surrounding her with love , at the end .",
      "Political views .",
      "On politics , Moore stated he was a conservative and thought that conservatism is the way to run a country . Moore was described as a lifelong supporter of the Conservative Party and endorsed the party during 2001 UK general election . However , Moore also expressed a reluctance to be seen as an overtly political figure and felt his work with UNICEF meant that he could not involve himself directly in politics .",
      "In 2011 , Moore gave his support to Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron regarding his policy on the European Union , stating : I think hes doing absolutely wonderfully well , despite the opposition from many members of his own party . Traitors , I call them . I mean any hardliner within the Conservative Party who speaks out against their leader . You should support your leader .",
      "Moore also expressed support for Britain keeping the pound sterling as its national currency and was glad the British government had not joined the single EU currency , stating : I would have been very upset if wed had to take the Queen off our currency . Theyd probably have to take her off the stamps and everything . I am British and Im fiercely independent . And I think we should be independent , as Sean Connery is about Scotland .",
      "In 2015 , Moore criticised what he regarded as excessive political correctness within the film industry and felt that rewriting James Bonds sexuality , gender or ethnicity would be a mistake , arguing it is not about being homophobic or , for that matter , racist \u2013 it is simply about being true to the character . Due to his conservative politics , Moore retained membership of the entertainment and media trade union BECTU until his death , having joined as an apprentice animation technician before his acting career took off . At his death , he was the unions longest-tenured member In 2007 , Moore also gave his support to workers from the Cadbury chocolate factory at Keynsham who were protesting against the plants closure .",

Moore became a resident of Monaco , having been appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of Monaco by Prince Albert II for his efforts in internationally promoting and publicising the principality . Moore was scathing of the Russian population in Monaco , saying , Im afraid were overstuffed with Russians . All the restaurant menus are in Russian now .",
      "Moore was vocal in his defence of his tax exile status , saying that in the 1970s , with taxes levied on top earners under the Labour government of James Callaghan , he had been urged by his accountants , agents , and lawyers to move abroad because , At that point we were taxed up to 98% on unearned income , so you would never be able to save enough to ensure that you had any sort of livelihood if you didnt work . Moore said in 2011 that his decision to live abroad was not about tax . Thats a serious part of it . I come back to England often enough not to miss it , to see the changes , to find some of the changes good...I paid my taxes at the time that I was earning a decent income , so Ive paid my due .",

      "Twenty days after her divorce from Keough , Presley married singer Michael Jackson . They had first met in 1975 when a seven-year-old Presley attended several of his concerts in Las Vegas . According to a friend of Presleys , their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A . As child molestation accusations became public , Jackson became dependent on Lisa for emotional support . She was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs . Lisa explained , I believed he didnt do anything wrong , and that he was wrongly accused and , yes , I started falling for him . I wanted to save him . I felt that I could do it . Shortly afterwards , she tried to persuade Jackson to settle the allegations out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover . He subsequently did both . In January 1996 , citing irreconcilable differences , Lisa Marie filed for divorce , according to legal papers . Michael Jacksons make-up artist , Karen Faye , later claimed that he had originally planned to file for divorce first and had relented after Presley begged him not to file . He discovered the next day that Presley had filed for divorce . In an October 2010 interview with talk-show host Oprah Winfrey , Presley revealed that she and Jackson had spent four years on and off following their divorce together in an attempt to reconcile , and that she had traveled to different parts of the world in order to be with him .",

In a 2003 interview with The Commercial Appeal , Presley commented on reports that she and Keough were planning to remarry : Danny is my best friend , always has been , always will be . I love him unconditionally , but we are not together . Its not like that . Keough and Presley became closer again after Presley divorced Michael Jackson . Keoughs younger brother Thomas Keough had been an official witness at Presleys wedding to Michael Jackson .",

World Literacy Crusade is regarded by critics as a front group for the Church of Scientology . On September 26 of that same year Presley addressed a Congressional hearing in opposition to the use of medication in treating ADHD , stating : I have spoken to children who have been forced to take a cocaine-like stimulant to control their behavior ; I have shared their sense of sheer desperation . Children have been wrenched from their familys care simply because their parents favored an alternative , drug-free approach to addressing educational and behavioral problems . The psychotropic drugging of millions of children has to stop . These views reflected her beliefs as a Scientologist . Addressing the Committee as the International Spokesperson for Childrens Rights , for the Citizens Commission on Human Rights ( CCHR ) , a group run by Scientologists , Presley expressed her view that parents should be informed about alternatives to drugs so they may make an informed choice about their childs educational and medical needs .",

The beneficiaries of the trust were Vernon , Elvis grandmother Minnie Mae Presley , and his nine-year-old daughter Lisa Marie Presley , whose inheritance was to be held in trust until her 25th birthday . After Vernons death in 1979 , Elvis former wife Priscilla Presley was named as one of three trustees in his will ; the others were the National Bank of Commerce in Memphis and Joseph Hanks , who had been the Presleys accountant . With Minnie Mae Presleys death in 1980 , Lisa became the only surviving beneficiary named in her fathers will .",

In January 2015 it was reported that both planes were for sale . They are no longer airworthy , but their owner was hoping to sell them for $10M in total . The buyer would have an option to purchase land adjacent to Graceland to exhibit them independently from Graceland . In the end , EPE bought them back and they continue to be on exhibit .",

      "Jean Lassalle ( ; born 3 May 1955 ) is a French politician serving as an Independent member of the National Assembly since 2002 . He was a candidate in the 2017 presidential election under the banner of R\u00e9sistons ! and received 435,301 votes ( 1.21% ) .",
      "Political career .",
      "Lassalle has served as mayor of the commune of Lourdios-Ich\u00e8re since 21 March 1977 , and has sat on the conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral of the d\u00e9partement of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques since 22 March 1982 , serving as vice-president since 1 January 1991 . He was elected to the National Assembly in the 2002 legislative election , and represents the 4th constituency of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques . Since 2002 Lassalle has led the World Mountain People Association , an international network of mountain-dwellers active in more than 70 countries . He also leads a Haut-B\u00e9arn cultural association .",
      "On 3 June 2003 Lassalle stood up in the National Assembly during questions to Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy and sang the Occitan anthem Se Canta in protest at an announcement by Sarkozy concerning the housing of 23 gendarmes tasked with guarding the Somport tunnel , which links France with Spain through the Pyrenees . The village closest to the French end of the tunnel is Urdos , but it was announced that the gendarmes would be housed in the nearby town of Oloron-Sainte-Marie , on the grounds that their wives would become bored in Urdos .",
      "As he explained in an interview with France 3 later that day , Lassalle took exception to what he saw as a slur on the Pyrenean village and decided to interrupt the minister with his song . The protest was met by laughter from other deputies , disapproval from the president of the Assembly , and bemusement from Sarkozy .",
      "In 2013 , Lassalle walked around France for eight months from April to December to meet people . He was afterwards quoted , \u201cEverywhere I went I witnessed a crisis in the standard of living , a loss of identity and the loss of a sense of a common destiny\u201d . He found the situation equally bad in the cities and the countryside . Scepticism about globalisation , distrust of politicians and latent racism were common among people he spoke to , he said .",
      "Hunger strike .",
      "Lassalle undertook a 39-day hunger strike in March/April 2006 , in protest at a threat to jobs in his constituency . Japanese firm Toyal , which owned a paint factory near Accous in the Vall\u00e9e dAspe and employed 150 of Lassalles constituents , announced plans to open a factory 60 km away . The firm claimed that this relocation of its investment would not result in the closure of the Accous site , but Lassalles concerns were not assuaged and he embarked on a hunger strike on 7 March .",
      "The strike ended on 14 April , when Toyal offered an assurance to Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy that the factory would not close , and that it would continue investment in the area before expanding elsewhere . Earlier the same day , Lassalle had been admitted to hospital in Garches , in the western suburbs of Paris , prompting intervention by President Jacques Chirac , Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Sarkozy . Lassalle had lost of weight over the course of the strike .",
      "2017 presidential campaign .",
      "In 2017 , Lassalle stood for President of France . His campaign spot included , among other things , mowing his lawn shirtless . He ultimately received 435,301 votes , 1.21% of the electorate , good enough for 7th place . Lassalles support disproportionately came from rural and southwest constituencies .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Lassalle was born in Lourdios-Ich\u00e8re , Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques . His son Thibault Lassalle is a rugby union player . He was a member of the French U19 team taking part in the 2006 U19 World Championships in Dubai , in which France reached the semi-final .",
      "On 20th September 2020 , Lassalle accidentally parked his car on a level crossing that later obstructed a passenger train , which was reported on by multiple news outlets . He was not fined for the incident , but jokingly commented that it would not have happened had he been driven by a personal driver .",

      "Beugr\u00f3 ( , ) is a Hungarian short-form improvisational comedy TV show . The shows format is similar to the one of Whose Line Is It Anyway? . It was first aired on December 31 , 2007 on TV2 , but was not renewed after the first season . The Hungarian public service television ( Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3 ) and Comedy Central Hungary took Beugr\u00f3 over after its cancellation , but one year later ( in 2009 ) they passed it to Cool TV . In 2011 , Viasat 3 bought the rights of the show but stopped production after only one year . The last episode was aired on January 1 , 2012 . The show had a spring and a fall season each year . In late 2017 , RTL II\u2014one of Cool TVs sister channels\u2014revived the series for a tenth anniversary season .",
      "Each episode of the show consists of four actors ( usually Lia Pokorny , Laura Ruttkay , P\u00e9ter K\u00e1lloy Moln\u00e1r , Gy\u0151z\u0151 Szab\u00f3 , P\u00e9ter Rudolf and/or Csaba Debreczeny ) who play improvisational games . As stage properties , they usually have nothing but four chairs . The types of games remain similar but the situations always change . The show is hosted by P\u00e9ter Nov\u00e1k and is directed and produced by Iv\u00e1n Kapit\u00e1ny .",
      "History .",
      "The beginnings : 2007-2009 .",
      "Beugr\u00f3 was based on the idea of co-producer Tam\u00e1s Szurdi and went through a long preparatory phase . The games came from exercises played at the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest and from traditional Hungarian improvisational theatre . After the pilot was accepted the creators watched several international improvisational TV shows ( among others the Whose Line Is It Anyway? ) to determine the final format of the show . The original four actors were Lia Pokorny , P\u00e9ter K\u00e1lloy Moln\u00e1r , Gy\u0151z\u0151 Szab\u00f3 and P\u00e9ter Rudolf .",
      "The first episode was aired on New Years Eve in 2007 on TV2 . Beugr\u00f3 was both critically acclaimed and popular among audiences so it started as a weekly series on March 14 , 2008 starting at 11 pm ( CET ) . In the meantime the pilot episode , which was never aired , was uploaded on Videa ( a Hungarian video sharing website ) between March 13 and April 26 and was later included on the 2008 fall season DVD set . 11 further episodes were aired and a compilation of cut scenes . Though the show managed to rank #1 in 18-49 in its time slot , TV2 announced that it wont renew Beugr\u00f3 for a second season on May 6 . An internet petition was started to save the show , after which negotiations begun . It turned out that both Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3 ( Hungarian public service television ) and Comedy Central Hungary ( which hadnt started broadcasting by that time ) were interested in the project .",
      "Beugr\u00f3 continued on m1 ( in association with Comedy Central ) on Saturdays at 10 pm from September 13 . The length of the show was changed from 30 minutes to 50 minutes per episode and it became interactive ( viewers were asked to solve funny tasks , videotape it and upload on Videa ) . Also a completely new set design was introduced which was used with altering colours until it was changed again for season 7 . After Comedy Central Hungary started to broadcast ( October 1 ) it aired reruns of the show . After October 31 Beugr\u00f3 moved to Friday 9 pm . In December after a one-week break two more episodes aired at 9:20 pm counting altogether 14 episodes . On New Years Eve the actors performed in Millen\u00e1ris , where Dorottya Udvaros stood in for Lia Pokorny during the first act . The performance was connected to a dinner . Comedy Central held two Beugr\u00f3 weekends when in the afternoon they broadcast five-hour-long reruns of the show on January 24\u201325 and March 21\u201322 , 2009 . Season 3 started with the New Years Eve performance at 10:40 pm on Friday , February 13 . After an Easter break the show aired at 8:20 pm until June 5 . On May 5 , the actors participated on a charity event with the actors from A T\u00e1rsulat ( a talent show on m1 ) . Beugr\u00f3 Klub ( where fans could play the games from the show ) was started in club Take5 , in Budapest . On August 1 , they had a performance in Coke Club , Si\u00f3fok .",

Viasat 3s creative director G\u00e1bor Kereszty in 2007 as director of TV2 suggested programme director L\u00f3r\u00e1nd Poich to buy Beugr\u00f3 . In 2011 he said the show fitted the target group of Viasat 3 . The channel gave the name Beugr\u00f3 plusz ( Stand-In Plus ) to the new season ( so that the audience can easily distinguish old episodes from the new ones ) . The decision was explained from the creative side with that the format was also somewhat changed . The new season , which started on March 11 , 2011 at 9:15 pm , looked for the sixth Beugr\u00f3-actor with the Beugr\u00f3-games in a talent show/reality way . The season featured six contestants ( young actors and actresses ) each of whom had a debut episode . Three of them were promoted to the second round ( one episode each ) . The winner , Laura Ruttkay had a third episode and there were two regular episodes as well . Season 7 ended on May 27 . Viewers could vote for the contestants via Facebook , but the winner was chosen by the producers of the show solely . P\u00e9ter Bozs\u00f3 got the majority of the votes . In season 7 the set design the opening theme and the opening sequence were all significantly changed .",

      "Philip A . Kuhn",
      "Philip A . Kuhn ( September 9 , 1933 \u2013 February 11 , 2016 ) was an American historian of China and the Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History and of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University .",
      "Kuhn was praised by his colleagues . Frederic Wakeman described Kuhn as one of the Wests premier China historians . Stanford University historian Harold L . Kahn added that \u201cEvery twenty years , like clockwork , Philip Kuhn produces a book that we are required to read . What he says sticks to the ribs and gives much pleasure,\u201d and Yale University historian Peter Perdue wrote that Kuhn shaped the field of Qing history more profoundly than any other scholar of his generation .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Kuhn was born on September 9 , 1933 in London . He was the elder son of Ferdinand and Delia Kuhn , to whom he dedicated his first book . His father had been bureau chief of the London Office of the New York Times and later served at the Washington Post . His mother was a writer who served as information director of the Office of Community War Services during World War II .",
      "Kuhn attended Woodrow Wilson High School and then received his A.B . from Harvard College .",
      "In 1954 , Kuhn studied Japanese and Japanese history at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London . He enlisted in the United States Army , serving from 1955 to 1958 . During this period , he studied Chinese and Chinese characters at the Defense Language Institute in California .",
      "1958 , Kuhn received his M.A . from Georgetown University , and 1959 , Ph.D . in History and East Asian Languages at Harvard University , where his dissertation advisor was John K . Fairbank . He married Sally Cheng ( ) in the 1960s and had one son , Anthony Kuhn , a journalist .",
      "That marriage dissolved in 1980 . He also had a daughter , Deborah W . Kuhn , with his second wife Mary L . Smith .",
      "Academic career .",
      "Kuhn taught at the University of Chicago from 1963 to 1978 where he attained the rank of Associate Professor in the Department of History . While at Chicago , Kuhn published in 1970 Rebellion and its Enemies in Late Imperial China : Militarization and Social Structure , 1796-1864 as part of the Harvard East Asian monograph series , which led to his being granted tenure and a full professorship .",
      "In 1978 Kuhn returned to Harvard , where he succeeded his mentor John King Fairbank . From 1980 to 1986 , Kuhn served as director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies .",
      "Impact and evaluations .",
      "A pioneer of social history in Chinese history , Kuhn helped re-evaluate the impact-response school of Western scholarship on China associated with his mentor , John Fairbank . Gong Yongmei , a researcher at the Center for China Studies Abroad at East China Normal University , observed that in his early work , Kuhn followed in the steps of his mentors , Fairbank and Benjamin I . Schwartz , but where they saw the modern history of China as a story of decline and stagnation , he stressed the new social and political forms that were created internally , not imported from the west , and that progressed toward modernization . That is , he did not favor either the traditional Chinese framework of the dynastic cycle or the Cold War American framework of Western impact and Chinas response . Kuhns dissertation research started with local militarization that put power in the hands of local gentry at the expense of the central government .",
      "This doctoral research resulted in book-length chapters on the Taiping Rebellion in the Cambridge History of China , and his initial book , Rebellion and Its Enemies in Late Imperial China ; Militarization and Social Structure , 1796-1864 , published by Harvard University Press in 1970 . In his influential analysis of American historians of China , Paul A . Cohen says that Rebellion and Its Enemies is a landmark study which begins to modify the line of interpretation which sees Chinas modernization as brought from outside China and outside Chinese tradition and that Kuhn instead addresses the nature of change taking place before the coming of the West . His question is not response to Western imperialism but what was happening in eighteenth century China ?",
      "When the Beijing archives of the Qing dynasty became open to American scholars , Kuhn was among the first to spend extended time exploring them . His second monograph , Soulstealers : The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768 ( 1990 ) was centered on an incident of alleged shamanic witchcraft \u2013 \u201csoul stealing\u201d \u2013 that took place in the spring of 1768 . Reports reached the Qianlong Emperor that wandering sorcerers were stealing the souls of children , laborers , fishmongers , landlords , and the wives of grain transporters by cutting their queues or lapels , igniting panic in the countryside . Outsiders who were suspected of this witchcraft were arrested and tortured , and some were lynched . When skeptical mid-level or provincial bureaucrats initially resisted this local response because they regarded local beliefs as superstitious , the emperor threatened them with punishment or even death if they didn\u2019t find the alleged sorcerers and eradicate this menace to his imperial order . Kuhn uses detailed reports filed by officials at all levels to describe local society and bureaucratic tensions between local , mid-level and central bureaucrats in response to the emperors paranoid demands . Kuhn shows how the Qing bureaucracy worked in order to shed light on the theoretical question first posed by Max Weber on the nature of political power in China .",
      "Stanford University historian Harold L . Kahns review in Journal of Asian Studies said that Kuhns mastery of ( and profound affection for ) archival documents-confessions , trial records , court letters , secret ( and not-so-secret ) memorials , above all the vermillion rescripts of the emperor- and his anthropological rummaging in law codes and ritual permit us to follow him into local ecologies of uncertainty in an age of affluence , into an understanding of the fragile , busy , often embattled inner life of the popular soul , into the insecurities of Manchu ethnic sensibility and imperial loathing of the south and its soft blandishments.\u201d Kuhn \u201cconstructs a social history of contagion at one level , an operational history of power at another , and then watches with benign irony as the subjects of both intersect at ever-ascending levels of victimization.\u201d",
      "The books central theme is the relation between the power of the monarch and the restraining power of the bureaucracy . Pamela Kyle Crossley calls it \u201ccertainly one of the most thoughtful , and may well be one of the last , ruminations on the implications of Weberian concepts for studies of the Chinese state.\u201d Kuhn sees the emperorship \u201clocked in uneasy partnership with the bureaucracy,\u201d resisting Webers characterization of Chinese monarchy as a \u201cgenuinely autocratic institution,\u201d and argues that the monarchy was able to reposition itself against the bureaucracy until it permanently lost this advantage in the 19th century . Kahn comments that the book shows autocratic power and bureaucratic complacency \u201cfed on each other\u201d and so \u201creinforced the sinews of the ancien regime,\u201d a position that ran counter to Weber\u2019s notion of mutual incompatibility in a zero-sum battle for power .",
      "Jonathan Spences review in Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies also praises Kuhn for drawing attention to the often neglected role of shamanism and sorcery in late imperial China . He lauded Kuhns treatment of hair and magic , especially in the thinking of the Manchu emperors , making the stealing of the queue an especially sensitive issue .",
      "The Chinese translation of Soulstealers sold more than 100,000 copies . Some readers saw contemporary relevance . One of the books translators , a history professor at East China Normal University , wrote in a postscript to the 2011 edition that the mass hysteria described in the book has often recurred in China , and that this hysteria reached a peak in the 1960s and 1970s in the unprecedented Great Revolution . One online discussion drew 10,000 comments . One wrote On the rare occasions when a rebellion was successful , that success merely produced another imperial court , and quoted Kuhns book as an explanation : Because the empowerment of ordinary people remains , even now , an unmet promise .",
      "Kuhns last book , Chinese among Others : Emigration in Modern Times ( 2008 ) is a comprehensive study of the Chinese diaspora , that is , the historic movement of Chinese out of China . Gong Yongmei notes that a distinctive feature of Philip Kuhn\u2019s scholarship is the importance of interpreting history from a theoretical paradigm... , a characteristic typical of American Chinese studies . In general , advanced theory and interpretative models are two remarkable advantages of American Chinese studies , and these are reflected in the analytical tools Kuhn draws on and the disciplines he borrows from in his research on Chinese immigrants : historical ecology , anthropology , sociology and religious studies .",
      "Kuhns students hold professorships at universities in Asia , North America , and Europe , among them : Cynthia Brokaw , Professor of History , Brown University ; Timothy Brook , the Principal of St . Johns College at University of British Columbia ; Timothy Cheek , Louis Cha Chair in Chinese Research and Director , Centre for Chinese Research at University of British Columbia ; Prasenjit Duara , Duke University ; Karl Gerth , Professor of History and Hwei-Chih and Julia Hsiu Endowed Chair in Chinese Studies at UC San Diego ; William C .

      "Selected works .",
      "In a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Philip Kuhn , OCLC/WorldCat encompasses roughly 30+ works in 90+ publications in 7 languages and 2,900+ library holdings . Kuhn published numerous articles and five books , as well as chapters in Cambridge History of China .",

      "Charles Holden",
      "Charles Henry Holden ( 12 May 1875 \u2013 1 May 1960 ) was a Bolton-born English architect best known for designing many London Underground stations during the 1920s and 1930s , for Bristol Central Library , the Underground Electric Railways Company of Londons headquarters at 55 Broadway and for the University of Londons Senate House . He also created many war cemeteries in Belgium and northern France for the Imperial War Graves Commission .",
      "After working and training in Bolton and Manchester , Holden moved to London . His early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement , but for most of his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing . Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings intended functions . After the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist , influenced by European architecture . He was a member of the Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers Guild . He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings .",
      "Although not without its critics , his architecture is widely appreciated . He was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects ( RIBAs ) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1943 . His station designs for London Underground became the corporations standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s . Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status , protecting them from unapproved alteration . He twice declined the offer of a knighthood .",
      "Early life .",
      "Charles Henry Holden was born on 12 May 1875 at Great Lever , Bolton , the fifth and youngest child of Joseph Holden ( 1842\u20131918 ) , a draper and milliner , and Ellen ( n\u00e9e Broughton , 1841\u20131890 ) Holden . Holdens childhood was marred by his fathers bankruptcy in 1884 and his mothers death when he was fifteen years old . Following the loss of his fathers business , the family moved to St Helens , where his father returned to his earlier trade and worked as an iron turner and fitter and where he attended a number of schools .",
      "He briefly had jobs as a laboratory assistant and a railway clerk in St Helens . During this period he attended draughting classes at the YMCA and considered a career as an engineer in Sir Douglas Foxs practice . In 1891 he began working for his brother-in-law , David Frederick Green , a land surveyor and architect in Bolton . In April 1892 he was articled to Manchester architect Everard W . Leeson and , while training with him , also studied at the Manchester School of Art ( 1893\u201394 ) and Manchester Technical School ( 1894\u201396 ) .",
      "While working and studying in Manchester , Holden formed friendships with artist Muirhead Bone and his future brother-in-law Francis Dodd . About this time Holden was introduced to the writings of Walt Whitman and became friends with James William Wallace and a number of the members of Boltons Whitman society known as the Eagle Street College . Whitmans writings and those of Henry David Thoreau , Ralph Waldo Emerson and Edward Carpenter were major influences on Holdens life . He incorporated many of their philosophies and principles into his style of living and method of working .",
      "In 1895 and 1896 Holden submitted designs to Building News Designing Club competitions using the pseudonym The Owl . Although the number of competing submissions made was not always large , from nine competition entries , Holden won five first places , three second places and one third place . In 1897 , he entered the competition for the RIBAs prestigious Soane Medallion for student architects . Of fourteen entries , Holdens submission for the competitions subject , a Provincial Market Hall , came third . Holden described the design as being inspired by the work of John Belcher , Edgar Wood and Arthur Beresford Pite .",
      "Family life .",
      "Around 1898 Holden began living with Margaret Steadman ( n\u00e9e Macdonald , 1865\u20131954 ) , a nurse and midwife . They were introduced by Holdens older sister , Alice , and became friends through their common interest in Whitman . Steadman had separated from her husband James Steadman , a university tutor , because of his alcoholism and abuse . Steadman and her husband were never divorced and , though she and Holden lived as a married couple and Holden referred to her as his wife , the relationship was never formalised , even after James Steadmans death in 1930 .",
      "The Holdens lived in suburban Norbiton , Surrey ( now Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames ) until 1902 , when they moved to Codicote in Hertfordshire . Around 1906 , they moved to Harmer Green near Welwyn , where Holden designed a house for them . The house was plainly furnished and the couple lived a simple life , described by Janet Ashbee in 1906 as bananas and brown bread on the table ; no hot water ; plain living and high thinking and strenuous activity for the betterment of the World . The couple had no children together , though Margaret had a son , Allan , from her marriage . Charles and Margaret Holden lived at Harmer Green for the rest of their lives .",
      "Works .",
      "Early career .",
      "Holden left Leesons practice in 1896 and worked for Jonathan Simpson in Bolton in 1896 and 1897 , working on house designs there and at Port Sunlight , before moving to London to work for Arts and Crafts designer Charles Robert Ashbee . His time with Ashbee was short and , in October 1899 , he became chief assistant in H . Percy Adams practice , where he remained for the rest of his career .",
      "A number of Holdens early designs were for hospitals , which Adams practice specialised in . At this early stage in his career , he produced designs in a variety of architectural styles as circumstances required , reflecting the influences of a number of architects . Holden soon took charge of most of the practices design work . From 1900 to 1903 , Holden studied architecture in the evenings at the Royal Academy School . He also continued to produce designs in his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson .",
      "His red brick arts and craft fa\u00e7ades for the Belgrave Hospital for Children in Kennington , south London ( 1900\u201303 ) , were influenced by Philip Webb and Henry Wilson and feature steeply pitched roofs , corner towers and stone window surrounds . The building , now converted to apartments , is Grade II* listed .",
      "In 1902 , Holden won the architectural competition to design the Bristol Central Library . His Tudor Revival fa\u00e7ades in bath stone incorporate modernist elements complementing the adjacent Abbey Gate of Bristol Cathedral . The front fa\u00e7ade features oriel windows and sculpture groups with Chaucer , Bede and Alfred the Great by Charles Pibworth . Internally , the design is classical , with the furniture designed by Holden and the stone carving mostly by William Aumonier . It was described by architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as free Neo-Tudor and extremely pretty and by Andor Gomme as one of the great masterpieces of the early Modern Movement . It has been compared with Charles Rennie Mackintoshs Glasgow School of Art and it is sometimes suggested that Mackintoshs designs for the later part of the school were inspired by Holdens , although Pevsner noted that Mackintoshs designs were in circulation earlier . The building is Grade I listed .",
      "At Midhurst , West Sussex , Holden designed Tudor-style fa\u00e7ades for the Sir Ernest Cassel-funded King Edward VII Sanatorium ( 1903\u201306 ) . The building features long wings of south-facing rooms to maximise patients exposure to sunlight and fresh air . The design is in keeping with the buildings rural setting , with fa\u00e7ades in the local tile-hung style . Pevsner called this certainly one of the best buildings of its date in the country and a model of how to build very large institutions . He designed the sanitoriums V-shaped open-air chapel so that it could be used for both outdoor and indoor worship . Both buildings are Grade II* listed . Other hospitals he designed in this period include the British Seamens Hospital in Istanbul ( 1903\u201304 ) and the Womens Hospital in Soho , central London ( 1908 ) .",
      "For The Law Society he designed ( 1902\u201304 ) a simplified neoclassical extension to the existing Lewis Vulliamy-designed building in Chancery Lane with external sculptures by Charles Pibworth and a panelled arts and crafts interior with carving by William Aumonier and friezes by Conrad Dressler . Pevsner considered the fa\u00e7ades to be Mannerist : The fashionable term Mannerism can here be used legitimately ; for Holden indeed froze up and invalidated current classical motifs , which is what Mannerist architects did in the Cinquecento .",
      "In 1906 , Holden won the architectural competition to design a new headquarters for the British Medical Association on the corner of The Strand and Agar Street ( now Zimbabwe House ) . The six-storey L-shaped building replaced a collection of buildings on the site already occupied by the Association and provided it with accommodation for a council chamber , library and offices on the upper floors above space for shops on the ground floor and in the basement . Described by Powers as classicism reduced to geometric shapes , the first three storeys are clad in grey Cornish granite with Portland stone above . Located at second floor level was a controversial series of tall sculptures representing the development of science and the ages of man by Jacob Epstein . The building is Grade II* listed . Alastair Service considered it perhaps his best London building .",
      "In 1909 , Holden won the design competition for an extension to the Bristol Royal Infirmary . Subsequently dedicated to the memory of King Edward VII ( died 1910 ) , the extension ( 1911\u201312 ) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard . The plain , abstract blocks have towers on the corners and two-storey loggias , and are a further simplification of Holdens style .",
      "The practice became Adams & Holden in 1907 when Holden became a partner and Adams , Holden & Pearson when Lionel Pearson became a partner in 1913 . In 1913 , Holden was awarded the RIBAs Godwin medal and \u00a365 to study architecture abroad . He travelled to America in April 1913 and studied the organisation of household and social science departments at American universities in preparation for his design of the Wren-influenced Kings College for Women , Kensington . Other buildings by Holden before the First World War include modernist office buildings in Holborn and Oxford Street , an extension in red brick of Alfred Waterhouses Shire Hall in Bedford , and Arts and Crafts Sutton Valence School , Kent .",
      "Holden also worked with Epstein on the tomb of Oscar Wilde at P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in Paris ( 1911\u201312 ) . In 1915 , he was a founding member of the Design and Industries Association and he was a member of the Art Workers Guild from 1917 . Unsuccessful competition entries for which he produced designs include Strathclyde Royal Infirmary ( 1901 ) , Manchester Royal Infirmary ( 1904 ) , County Hall ( 1907 ) , the National Library of Wales ( 1909 ) , Coventry Town Hall ( 1911 ) and the Board of Trade building ( 1915 ) .",
      "War cemeteries and memorials .",
      "The Holdens shared a strong sense of personal duty and service . In the First World War , Margaret Holden joined the Friends Emergency Committee for the Assistance of Germans , Austrians and Hungarians in distress which helped refugees of those countries stranded in London by the conflict . Charles Holden served with the Red Crosss London Ambulance Column as a stretcher-bearer transferring wounded troops from Londons stations to its hospitals . Holden also served on the fire watch at St Pauls Cathedral between 1915 and 1917 .",
      "On 3 October 1917 , Holden was appointed a temporary lieutenant with the armys Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries . He travelled to the French battlefields for the first time later that month and began planning new cemeteries and expanding existing ones . Holden described his experience :",
      "The country is one vast wilderness , blasted out of recognition where once villages & orchards & fertile land , now tossed about & churned in hopeless disorder with never a landmark as far as the eye can reach & dotted about in the scrub and untidiness of it all are to be seen here & there singly & in groups little white crosses marking the place where men have fallen and been buried .",
      "In September 1918 , Holden transferred to the Imperial War Graves Commission ( now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission ) with the new rank of major . From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries . Initially , Holden ran the drawing office and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium ( Edwin Lutyens , Reginald Blomfield and Herbert Baker ) . Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at Louvencourt and , according to Geurst and Karol , probably on the one at Forceville that was selected as the prototype for all that followed .",
      "In 1920 , he was promoted to be the fourth principal architect . His work for the Commission included memorials to the New Zealand missing dead at Messines Ridge British Cemetery , and the Buttes New British Cemetery at Zonnebeke . His designs were stripped of ornament , often using simple detailed masses of Portland stone in the construction of the shelters and other architectural elements . Philip Longworths history of the Commission described Holdens pavilions at Wimereux Communal Cemetery as almost cruelly severe .",
      "In 1922 , Holden designed the War Memorial Gateway for Clifton College , Bristol , using a combination of limestone and gritstone to match the Gothic style of the schools buildings . For the British War Memorials Committee , he produced a design for a Hall of Remembrance ( 1918 ) that would have been in the form of an art gallery , and for New College , Oxford , he created a design for a tiny memorial chapel ( 1919 ) . Neither was constructed .",
      "London Transport .",
      "Through his involvement with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick , general manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) . Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport , but this changed through his collaboration with Pick . In 1923 , Pick commissioned Holden to design a fa\u00e7ade for a side entrance at Westminster Underground station . This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERLs pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition . Also in 1924 , Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway ( now part of the Northern line ) from Clapham Common to Morden . The designs replaced a set by the UERLs own architect , Stanley Heaps , which Pick had found unsatisfactory . The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries ; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen , each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations . The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel . Holden also advised Heaps on new fa\u00e7ades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway .",
      "During the later 1920s , Holden designed a series of replacement buildings and new fa\u00e7ades for station improvements around the UERLs network . Many of these featured Portland stone cladding and variations of the glazed screens developed for the Morden extension . At Piccadilly Circus , one of the busiest stations on the system , Holden designed ( 1925\u201328 ) a spacious travertine-lined circulating concourse and ticket hall below the roadway of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below .",
      "In 1926 , Holden began the design of a new headquarters for the UERL at 55 Broadway above St . Jamess Park station . Above the first floor , the steel-framed building was constructed to a cruciform plan and rises in a series of receding stages to a central clock tower tall . The arrangement maximises daylight to the buildings interior without the use of light wells . Like his stations of the period and his pre-First World War commercial buildings , the block is austerely clad in Portland stone . Holden again detailed the fa\u00e7ades with commissioned sculptures ; , two compositions by Epstein , are at first floor level , and a series of eight bas-reliefs at the seventh floor represent the four winds ( two for each of the cardinal directions , on each side of the projecting wings ) . The building is Grade I listed .",
      "In 1930 , Holden and Pick made a tour of Germany , the Netherlands , Denmark and Sweden to see the latest developments in modern architecture . The UERL was planning extensions of the Piccadilly line to the west , north-west and north of London , and a new type of station was wanted . Adapting the architectural styles he had seen on the tour , Holden created functional designs composed of simple forms : cylinders , curves and rectangles , built in plain brick , concrete and glass . The extensions to the west and north-west were over existing routes operated by the District line and required a number of stations to be rebuilt to accommodate additional tracks or to replace original , basic buildings . Sudbury Town , the first station to be rebuilt in 1931 , formed a template for many of the other new stations that followed : a tall rectangular brick box with a concrete flat roof and panels of vertical glazing to allow light into the interior . The Grade II* listed building was described by Pevsner as an outstanding example of how satisfying such unpretentious buildings can be , purely through the use of careful details and good proportions .",
      "For Arnos Grove station , one of eight new stations on the northern extension of the line , Holden modified the rectangular box into a circular drum , a design inspired by Gunnar Asplunds Stockholm Public Library . Also notable on the northern extension is Southgate station ; here Holden designed a single-storey circular building with a canopied flat roof . Above this , the central section of roof rises up on a continuous horizontal band of clerestory windows , supported internally by a single central column . The building is topped by an illuminated feature capped with a bronze ball . Other stations show the influence of Willem Marinus Dudoks work in Hilversum , Netherlands . In order to handle such a large volume of work , Holden delegated significant design responsibility to his assistants , such as Charles Hutton , who took the lead on Arnos Grove Station . For some other Piccadilly line stations the design was handled in-house by Stanley Heaps or by other architectural practices . All followed the modern brick , glass and concrete house style defined by Holden , but some lacked Holdens originality and attention to detail ; Pick dubbed these Holdenesque .",
      "The UERL became part of London Transport in 1933 , but the focus remained on high quality design . Under Pick , Holdens attention to detail and idea of integrated design extended to all parts of Londons transport network , from designing bus and tram shelters to a new type of six-wheeled omnibus . In the late 1930s , Holden designed replacement stations at Highgate , East Finchley and Finchley Central and new stations at Elstree South and Bushey Heath for the Northern lines Northern Heights plan . Holdens designs incorporated sculpture relevant to the local history of a number of stations : Dick Whittington for Highgate , a Roman centurion at Elstree South and an archer for East Finchley . Much of the project was postponed shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was later cancelled . Only East Finchley station was completed in full with Highgate in part ; the other plans were scrapped . East Finchley station is located on an embankment and the platforms are accessed from below . Making use of the stations air-rights , Holden provided staff office space spanning above the tracks accessed through semi-circular glazed stairways from the platforms . Eric Aumonier provided the statue The Archer , a prominent feature of the station .",
      "Holdens last designs for London Transport were three new stations for the Central line extension in north-east London . These were designed in the 1930s , but were also delayed by the war and were not completed until 1947 . reduced the quality of the materials used compared with the 1930s stations and the building at Wanstead was adapted from a temporary structure constructed during the lines wartime use as an underground factory . Gants Hill is accessed through subways and has no station building , but is notable for the design of its platform level concourse , which features a barrel vaulted ceiling inspired by stations on the Moscow Metro .",
      "University of London .",
      "After the First World War , the University of London needed a replacement for its overcrowded and scattered accommodation in Kensington . A site was acquired in Bloomsbury near the British Museum and Holden was commissioned in 1931 to design the new buildings , partly due to the success of 55 Broadway . His original plan was for a single structure covering the whole site , stretching almost from Montague Place to Torrington Street . It comprised a central spine linked by a series of wings to the perimeter fa\u00e7ade and enclosing a series of courtyards . The scheme was to be topped by two towers : a smaller one to the north , and a 19-storey , tall Senate House .",
      "Construction began in 1932 , but due to a shortage of funds , the design was gradually revised and cut back , and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937 , with the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies completed later . The design featured fa\u00e7ades of load-bearing brickwork faced with Portland stone . Holdens intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled . As he had with his earlier buildings , Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design . From its completion until 1957 , it was the tallest office building in London .",
      "Senate House divided opinion . Pevsner described its style as strangely semi-traditional , undecided modernism , and summarised : The design certainly does not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holdens smaller Underground stations . Others have described it as Stalinist , or as totalitarian due to its great scale . Functionalist architect Erich Mendelsohn wrote to Holden in 1938 that he was very much taken and .. . convinced that there is no finer building in London . Historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a static massive pyramid .. . obviously designed to last for a thousand years , but thought the interior is more pleasing than the exterior . There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity , serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece . The onset of the Second World War prevented any further progress on the full scheme , although Adams , Holden & Pearson did design further buildings for the university in the vicinity .",
      "Town planning .",
      "With virtually no new work being commissioned , Holden spent the war years planning for the reconstruction that would be required once it was over . Holden was a member of the RIBAs twelve-man committee which formulated the institutes policy for post-war reconstruction . Holdens town planning ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of Port Sunlight or Bournville where workers could live close to their workplace . The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing towns with new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres .",
      "In 1944\u201345 , Holden produced plans for the reconstruction of Canterbury , Kent , with the City Architect Herbert Millson Enderby . Canterbury had been badly damaged by Luftwaffe bombing including the Baedeker raids in May and June 1942 . Holden and Enderby aimed to preserve much of the character of the city , but planned for the compulsory purchase of of the town centre for large scale reconstruction including a new civic way from the cathedral to a new town hall . Outside the city , they planned bypasses and a ring road at a two-mile ( 3.2-kilometre ) radius of the centre . Although approved by the city council , the plan was widely opposed by residents and freeholders and the Canterbury Citizens Defence Association issued an alternative plan before taking control of the council at local elections in November 1945 . The change in administration ended the proposals , although a new plan prepared in 1947 without Holdens or Enderbys involvement retained some of their ideas including the ring road .",
      "The City of Londons first reconstruction plan was written by the City Engineer F . J . Forty and published in 1944 . It had met with considerable criticism and William Morrison , Minister for Town and Country Planning , asked the City of London Corporation to prepare a new plan . Holden was approached , and he accepted provided that William Holford also be appointed . Holdens and Holfords City of London Plan ( 1946\u20131947 ) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of plot ratio calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the ground area . For the bomb-devastated area around St Pauls Cathedral , Holden proposed a new precinct around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate . The heights of buildings would be strictly defined to protect these views . The plan was accepted by the Minister for Town and Country Planning in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan .",
      "In 1947 , Holden planned a scheme on behalf of the London County Council for the South Bank of the River Thames between County Hall and Waterloo Bridge , including a plan for a concert hall with the councils architect Edwin Williams . The scheme received little attention and was almost immediately superseded by plans to develop the area as the site of the Festival of Britain . Holden was also architectural and planning consultant to the University of Edinburgh and to the Borough of Tynemouth .",
      "Final years .",
      "Although Charles Holden had gradually reduced his workload , he was still continuing to go into the office three days per week during the early 1950s . He did not formally retire until 1958 , but even then he visited occasionally . Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s . In the last decade of his life , Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green .",
      "One of Holdens last public engagements was when he acted as a sponsor at the award of the RIBAs Royal Gold Medal to Le Corbusier in 1953 . The last project that Holden worked on was a much criticised headquarters building for English Electric in Aldwych , London . In 1952 , Adams , Holden & Pearson were appointed by English Electrics chairman , Sir George Nelson , and Holden designed a monolithic stone building around a courtyard . In 1955 , the London County Council persuaded English Electric to put the scheme aside and hold a limited architectural competition for a new design . Adams , Holden & Pearson submitted a design , but were beaten by Sir John Burnet , Tait and Partners . When that practice later refused Sir George Nelsons request to redesign the fa\u00e7ades , Adams , Holden & Pearson were reappointed and Charles Holden revised his practices competition entry . The new design was criticised by the Royal Fine Art Commission and a further redesign was carried out by one of Holdens partners to produce the final design , described by Pevsner as a dull , lifeless building , stone-faced and with nothing to recommend it .",
      "Holden died on 1 May 1960 . His body was cremated at Enfield crematorium and his ashes were spread in the garden of the Friends Meeting House in Hertford . On 2 June 1960 a memorial service was held at St Pancras New Church , where Holden had designed the altar in 1914 . Obituaries were published in daily newspapers The Manchester Guardian , The Times and The Daily Telegraph and in construction industry periodicals including The Builder , Architectural Review , Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Journal of the Town Planning Institute . Generally , the obituaries were positive about Holdens early work and the stations for London Underground , were neutral about Senate House and were negative about his practices later works . The Harmer Green house and most of its contents were auctioned with the proceeds left to family members . Holden also left \u00a38,400 to friends and staff and \u00a32,000 to charity .",
      "Holden on architecture .",
      "Holden recognised that his architectural style placed him in rather a curious position , not quite in the fashion and not quite out of it ; not enough of a traditionalist to please the traditionalists and not enough of a modernist to please the modernists . He believed that the principal aim of design was to achieve fitness for purpose , and repeatedly called for a style of architecture that avoided unnecessary architectural adornment .",
      "In 1905 , in an essay titled If Whitman had been an Architect , Holden made an anonymous plea to architects for a new form of modern architecture : Often I hear of the glory of the architecture of ancient Greece ; of the proud Romans ; of sombre Egypt ; the praise of vast Byzantium and the lofty Middle Ages , too , I hear . But of the glory of the architecture of the Modern I never hear . Come , you Modern Buildings , come ! Throw off your mantle of deceits ; your cornices , pilasters , mouldings , swags , scrolls ; behind them all , behind your dignified proportions , your picturesque groupings , your arts and crafts prettinesses and exaggerated techniques ; behind and beyond them all hides the one I love .",
      "In his 1936 speech when presented with the RIBAs Royal Gold Medal , Holden defined his position : It was not so much a matter of creating a new style , as of discarding those incrustations which counted for style .. . surface embroidery empty of structural significance . His method was to focus on those more permanent basic factors of architecture , the plan , and the planes and masses arising out of the plan . He described his ideal building as one which takes naturally and inevitably the form controlled by the plan and the purpose and the materials . A building which provides opportunities for the exercise and skill and pleasure in work not only to the designer but also for the many craftsmen employed and the occupants of the building .",
      "In a 1957 essay on architecture , he wrote I dont seek for a style , either ancient or modern , I want an architecture which is through and through good building . A building planned for a specific purpose , constructed in the method and use of materials , old or new , most appropriate to the purpose the building has to serve .",
      "Recognition and legacy .",
      "Holden won the RIBAs London Architecture Medal for 1929 ( awarded 1931 ) for 55 Broadway . In 1936 he was awarded the RIBAs Royal Gold Medal for his body of work . He was Vice President of the RIBA from 1935\u201337 and a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission from 1933 to 1947 . In 1943 he was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry for the design of transport equipment . He was awarded honorary doctorates by Manchester University in 1936 and London University in 1946 . Many of Holdens buildings have been granted listed status , protecting them against demolition and unapproved alteration .",
      "Holden declined the invitation to become a Royal Academician in 1942 , having previously been nominated , but refused because of his connection to Epstein . He twice declined a knighthood , in 1943 and 1951 , as he considered it to be at odds with his simple lifestyle and considered architecture a collaborative process .",
      "The RIBA holds a collection of Holdens personal papers and material from Adams , Holden & Pearson . The RIBA staged exhibitions of his work at the Heinz Gallery in 1988 and at the Victoria and Albert Museum between October 2010 and February 2011 . A public house near Colliers Wood Underground station has been named The Charles Holden , taking inspiration from the architect ."

      "Sydney Trains C set",
      "The C sets were a class of electric multiple unit train operated by Sydney Trains in New South Wales , Australia . The carriages were of stainless steel , double deck construction .",
      "Design & construction .",
      "The C sets were a follow-on from the K sets . They were built as an interim measure due to the lateness of the Tangara program . They were also used to train and familiarise staff with the new ( at the time ) chopper technology . They were the first Sydney suburban trains to be fitted with chopper control , which gives the train smoother acceleration . Gate turn-off thyristors ( GTO ) were used to control power to the traction motors , hence allowing for smoother acceleration . Following the success of the implementation of chopper control , these features were later installed on the Tangara and later V set carriages .",
      "The C set carriages were also the first on the suburban network to feature fixed seating ( originally covered with fabric , since replaced with vinyl ) . This proved to be unpopular , but nevertheless , fixed seating was later used on the suburban Tangara cars . These cars also featured push-button doors requiring passengers to activate , to increase air-conditioning efficiency . These proved unpopular and the push-buttons on the doors were removed .",
      "The C set was distinguished externally by a fibreglass molding mounted on the front of the power carriage . It was originally in the State Rail Authority white with orange and red candy livery stripes on the lower portion . C3596 was the only power car to have its Candy-liveried front repainted in CityRail blue and yellow prior to its Citydecker refurbishment in 1998 . The chopper cars were amongst the heaviest in the suburban fleet , with the power cars weighing 52 tonnes .",
      "- The order was for 56 cars :",
      "In service .",
      "The first set entered service in July 1986 , operating out of Mortdale Maintenance Depot , some were delivered to Hornsby Maintenance Depot , but by December 1988 , all were operating out of Punchbowl Maintenance Depot as sets K40-K51 .",
      "The chopper cars were originally targeted as K sets and for a while when they entered service , they ran together with the then-force ventilated K sets . This however caused problems in service as force-ventilated cars were fitted with camshaft control and led to jerking while accelerating . By December 1990 , they had been retargeted as C42-C54 . In January 1991 , these were reformed as 6-car sets numbered C1-C8 . By June 1991 , all had been transferred to Hornsby Maintenance Depot .",
      "One C set , C6 , was painted in a livery having its fiber-glass front being painted in CityRail colours , with the L7 logo .",
      "During the late 1990s , all were refurbished by A Goninan & Co as part of the CityDecker program . This saw the interiors refurbished with white walls and ceilings , grey floors and blue seats . Power cars received a destination indicator and had the yellow apron livery applied which includes a grey front with yellow over the bottom half .",
      "In 2001 , the C sets were once again reformed into seven 8-car sets . A 6-car C Set was re-formed in late 2006 due to car T4262 being seriously damaged by an arson attack at Villawood in October 2006 , however the full 8-car set later went back in operation .",
      "In July 2017 , asbestos was found in the circuit breaker panels , which was inside the driver compartment of the C sets , with all withdrawn for inspection .",
      "Since November 2017 , all C Sets operated out of Flemington Maintenance Depot .",
      "Since then C sets have operated on the following lines :",
      "- T2 Inner West and Leppington Line : Leppington or Parramatta to City Circle via Granville",
      "- T3 Bankstown Line : Liverpool or Lidcombe to City Circle via Bankstown",

      "UD Las Palmas",
      "Uni\u00f3n Deportiva Las Palmas , S.A.D . is a Spanish football team based in Las Palmas , in the autonomous community of Canary Islands . Founded on 22 August 1949 , it plays in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n , holding home games at the Estadio Gran Canaria , with a capacity of 32,400 seats .",
      "The club remains the only one in Spanish football to achieve back-to-back promotions to La Liga in its first two seasons . It had a 19-year run in the competition , ending in 1982\u201383 . They have been promoted to La Liga on three additional occasions since that time ( a total of eight additional seasons ) , most recently from 2015 to 2018 .",
      "Its main rivals are Tenerife from said neighbouring island . Las Palmas and Tenerife contest the Canary Islands derby . The two clubs are among the most isolated professional football clubs in Europe , since they play their away games on the distant Spanish mainland .",
      "History .",
      "Foundation and early years .",
      "Even though the club registered with the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 6 June 1949 , UD Las Palmas was officially founded on 22 August of that year , as the result of a merger between all five clubs on the island : Club Deportivo Gran Canaria , Atl\u00e9tico Club de F\u00fatbol , Real Club Victoria , Arenas Club and Marino F\u00fatbol Club . The union was to create a club strong enough to keep Canarian players on the island and not to seek a better career on the mainland .",
      "Debate was held on the name of the club , which it was agreed would not include the names of any of its predecessors . An early option , Deportivo Canarias , was scrapped due to referring to the Canary Islands on a whole rather than the island of Gran Canaria . The name Las Palmas by itself was also put forward , and then rejected due to the name having already been taken by a defunct club in the city ; Uni\u00f3n Deportiva Las Palmas was finally chosen due to its connection to the union which created the team , and its home city of Las Palmas . The first training session at the new club was held on 16 September 1949 .",
      "Las Palmas finished second in their first season in the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n ( 1949\u201350 ) , ranking third in the following years Segunda Divisi\u00f3n to reach La Liga for the first time ever , and became the first Spanish club to achieve consecutive promotions in its first two years of existence . The first season in the top flight ended , however , in relegation , but the team returned to the category in 1954 , going on to enjoy a six-year spell .",
      "Top-flight success .",
      "After Las Palmas returned to La Liga at the end of the 1963\u201364 season , again as champions , the club went on to have their most successful spell in the competition . Managed by Vicente Dauder , they finished third in 1967\u201368 behind Real Madrid and FC Barcelona , and four club players made the Spain squad which hosted and won the UEFA Euro 1964 tournament ; the following season the team fared even better and only lost the league to Real Madrid , and thus qualified for European competition for the first time in its history , appearing in the 1969\u201370 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and being knocked out in the first round by Germanys Hertha BSC ( 0\u20130 home draw , 0\u20131 away loss ) .",
      "Las Palmas player Juan Guedes died suddenly on 9 March 1971 at the age of 28 . The next season , French coach Pierre Sinibaldi led the club to the fifth place , with subsequent qualification for the UEFA Cup : after disposing of Torino F.C . and \u0160K Slovan Bratislava , the Spaniards bowed out to Dutch club FC Twente ; at the end of 1974\u201375 another team player , Tonono \u2013 a defender who played with Guedes \u2013 died of a liver infection .",
      "Las Palmas third appearance in European competition came with the 1977\u201378 UEFA Cup , where they defeated FK Sloboda Tuzla of Yugoslavia in the first round before falling to the English side Ipswich Town . Under the management of Miguel Mu\u00f1oz , and with players such as Argentines Miguel \u00c1ngel Brindisi , Daniel Carnevali ( the first to arrive in 1973 ) , Carlos Morete and Quique Wolff , the club also reached their first final of the Copa del Rey in that year , losing on 19 April to Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium ( 1\u20133 ) .",
      "From the 1990s onwards , Las Palmas played mainly in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n , but also spent six years in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B \u2013 the new third level created in 1977 \u2013 and , from 2000 to 2002 , competed in the top flight . On 3 October 2001 the side managed a 4\u20132 home win against Real Madrid , with youth product Rub\u00e9n Castro scoring two goals for the hosts , but the season ended nonetheless in relegation . On 22 December 2001 , Las Palmas played its 1,000th game in La Liga . In the 2009\u201310 season in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n the club finished 17th , just one point away from being relegated to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B . On 21 June 2015 , Las Palmas was promoted back to La Liga after defeating Real Zaragoza on the away goals rule .",

      "Arseny Mironov",
      "Arseny Dmitrievich Mironov ( 25 December 1917 \u2013 3 July 2019 ) was a Russian scientist , aerospace engineer , and aviator . He was one of the oldest researchers in aircraft aerodynamics and flight testing , a Gromov Flight Research Institute ( GFRI ) director from 1981 to 1985 , a recipient of the Stalin Prize in 1948 and the USSR State Prize in 1976 , and an honorary citizen of Zhukovsky .",
      "Mironov contributed to aviation engineering and research through the GFRI , serving as a flight test engineer , researcher , and director . He turned 100 in December 2017 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Mironov was born in Vladimir . His father was Dmitry I . Mironov ( ; 1884\u20131956 ) , an engineer-electrician who worked for hydroelectric power station Klasson in Moscow Oblast and later for electric company Mosenergo in Moscow . His mother was Maria Mikhailovna Ilyicheva ( ; 1889\u20131982 ) , who was a housewife .",
      "Two years after leaving school , Mironov worked as a factory electrician .",
      "Career .",
      "Early years .",
      "In 1936 , Mironov entered the Moscow Aviation Institute ( MAI ) at a new course Flight Testing and graduated in 1941 . In May 1941 , he started working for the Gromov Flight Research Institute ( GFRI ) within the Minaviaprom of the USSR .",
      "Scientific career .",
      "In the GFRI , Mironov primarily did engineering and research . He started as a flight test engineer just three days before the beginning of the Great Patriotic War . During the war , he participated in the serial production of fighter planes , which included flight and ground testing ( to eliminate quality defects in the aircrafts flying and fighting capabilities ) conducted by the GFRI and aircraft manufacturers .",
      "Post-war , Mironov developed methods for aerodynamic research using free-flying models , making a breakthrough in collecting in-flight data concerning wing profile pressure distribution at transonic speeds . As a lead scientist , he organized the GFRIs flight research in aeroplanes physical aerodynamics and associated environment effects , including the sonic boom impact of supersonic aeroplanes .",
      "In 1968-1975 , Mironov together with V . S . Grachev conducted flight studies of the aerodynamic characteristics of an experimental ogival delta wing designed for the then developing supersonic airliner Tupolev Tu-144 . These studies were conducted at the GFRI on one of the two specially created testbed aeroplanes MiG-21I ( I - from the imitator ) . The research flights were performed by Igor Volk , Oleg Gudkov and Vladislav Loychikov .",
      "Mironov participated in the development and implementation of the Aircraft Testing Handbooks , a series of official guides for the flight and ground testing of military aircraft . He played a major role in the USSRs communication with the International Civil Aviation Organization in the development of aircraft type certification and noise regulation , especially for supersonic transport aeroplanes .",
      "As a member of investigation commissions , Mironov was closely involved in the investigation of aviation accidents , including the March 1968 MiG-15 training flight accident involving Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Seryogin , the 1972 Il-62 airliner crash near Nerskoye Lake , and others . Regarding the MiG-15 training flight accident , Mironov developed and publicly supported a scientifically-grounded position against numerous different explanations and conspiracies .",
      "Mironov became the head of the GFRIs research division . He then worked as a deputy to , who was the institutes chief from 1969 to 1974 . Later , Mironov became his first deputy after veteran Max Taitz . When Utkin died in 1981 , Mironov became the institutes chief ( 1982 ) , serving until was appointed in 1985 . From 1981 to 1985 , Mironov was a head of the Aerophysical and Flight Research Department within the Aeromechanics and Flight Engineering Faculty of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology .",
      "From 1996 to 2019 , Mironov worked for the GFRI as a principal researcher in human factors and flight safety .",
      "Flight career .",
      "Since childhood , Mironov was interested in aviation and aircraft modelling . While studying in the MAI , he completed the initial flight training course at MAIs aero-club with a U-2 pilot license . He later completed gliding flight training and made several parachute jumps .",
      "In a group of students visiting the GFRI , Mironov met with then-chief Mikhail Gromov and explained his plans to be a test pilot , to which Gromov responded , Will see . Since his early days in the institute , Mironov was involved in aircraft flight testing as a test engineer , navigator , and transport pilot . On 4 October 1943 , an accident occurred in the La-5 aircrafts test flight with Mironov in the flight crew\u2014a mid-air collision with air defence patrol fighter Yak-1 , whose pilot violated normal procedure flying too close to a test aeroplane . Mironov was severely wounded and spent five months in a hospital . Lasting issues in his left elbow hindered Mironovs ability to train and apply for a test pilot position . However , he passed the check flight with the institutes senior test pilot , proving he could fly light transport aeroplanes such as the Po-2 . After the incident , Mironov frequently piloted aircraft , including the Po-2 and the Yakovlev UT-1 . He completed hundreds of transport flights and obtained a USSR fourth class air transport pilot license . Until 1950 , he was also involved in test flights as navigator and flight test engineer on aircraft such as the Il-2 , Pe-8 , Tu-2 , and Yak-9 .",
      "Mironovs flight training in gliding started before the war in Chkalov Central Aero-club in Moscow under the supervision of Sergey Anokhin . Mironovs flight instructor was Margarita Ratsenskaya , the aero-clubs gliding squad commander and Anokhins wife . Due to a mutual interest in gliding , Mironov became closely acquainted with Oleg Antonov and frequently piloted the Antonov A-15 glider .",
      "Family .",
      "Mironov was married to Olga Yevgenevna Rudneva ( ; 1919\u20132017 ) for 77 years . Rudneva studied in the same class in the MAI with her future husband . She worked at Kazan Aviation Plant and for the GFRI as a lead flight test engineer .",
      "The couple had two children . Their son , Mikhail Mironov ( ; born 1944 ) , is a Doctor of Physics and Math and an acoustic scientist working for the Andreyev Acoustics Institute . Their daughter , Olga Maksakova ( Mironova ) ( ; born 1946 ) is a psychotherapy practitioner and a Doctor of Medicine working for the Burdenko Neurosurgery National Research Center .",

      "Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres",
      "The Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres are a pair of stacked theatres in Toronto , Ontario , Canada . The Winter Garden Theatre is seven storeys above the Elgin Theatre . They are the last surviving Edwardian stacked theatres in the world .",
      "History .",
      "The pair of theatres were originally built as the flagship of Marcus Loews theatre chain in 1913 . The building was designed by architect Thomas W . Lamb , who also designed the Ed Mirvish Theatre nearby .",
      "Both theatres were built to show vaudeville acts and the short silent movies of the time . Each theatre was intended for a different class of patron . The gold-and-marble , domed , hard-top lower theatre ( originally called Loews Yonge Street Theatre ) was home to continuous vaudeville and movies . The upper-level Winter Garden is an atmospheric country garden under the stars , painted with murals of plants and garden trellises , with tree trunk columns and lantern lights . The upper theatre was built for the Big Time vaudeville market and had reserved seats at premium prices , catering to affluent patrons . As well as competing in a different market , the upper theatre could be used for experimentation with acts , without the risk of closing the lower theatre .",
      "By 1928 , feature-length silent films were popular , but sound films were just coming into their own . In 1928 , the lower theatre was converted to show sound films and the upper theatre was closed . The Winter Garden remained shuttered for about sixty years . Left inside it was a large collection of vaudeville flats and scenery , now the worlds largest surviving collection . In 1969 , Loews sold the Elgin to Famous Players . By the 1970s , the Elgin was showing mainly B movies and soft-core pornography .",
      "Recent history .",
      "Since 1979 , the Elgin Theatre has served as one of the hosts to the annual Toronto International Film Festival .",
      "In 1981 , the Ontario Heritage Foundation bought the structure from Famous Players . From March 1985 through March 1987 the musical Cats was very successfully presented in the essentially unrestored Elgin , showing the viability of the theatre . The building closed in 1987 for a full restoration and reopened in 1989 .",
      "In 1991 , Dr . David Griesinger and Steve Barbar of Lexicon , Inc. , at the request of acousticians Neil Muncy and Robert Tanner , installed the first production LARES system , an electroacoustic enhancement system that augments architectural acoustics , in the Elgin Theatre . This initial LARES system used two microphones placed at the balconys front edge to pick up sound from the stage . The microphone signals were digitized and processed in two mainframe computers , and the resulting signals were sent to 56 loudspeakers in the main ceiling and 60 under the balcony , for the purpose of providing additional intelligibility and ambience .",
      "The Elgin Theatre housed the world premiere of the Napoleon musical in 1994 , which later transferred to Londons West End in 2000 . In 1995 , it was home to The Whos Tommy musical . Since 1996 , Ross Petty Productions has staged pantomimes at the Elgin Theatre each Christmas season .",
      "From February 10 to 14 , 2004 , Conan OBrien taped four episodes of NBCs Late Night with Conan OBrien from the Elgin Theatre . The visit came about via the Toronto City Councils CDN$1 million ( ~US$750,000 at the time ) payment to NBC to have the American television program visit Toronto for a week worth of shows , part of the overall council-funded PR effort of promoting Toronto as a tourist destination for Americans in the wake of the widely publicized summer 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) epidemic which adversely impacted the citys tourism industry .",

      "Wellington , Somerset",
      "Wellington is a small market town in rural Somerset , a county in the west of England , situated south west of Taunton in the Somerset West and Taunton district , near the border with Devon , which runs along the Blackdown Hills to the south of the town . The town has a population of 14,549 , which includes the residents of the parish of Wellington Without , and the villages of Tone and Tonedale .",
      "Known as Weolingtun in the Anglo-Saxon period , its name had changed to Walintone by the time of the Domesday Book of 1086 . Wellington became a town under a royal charter of 1215 and during the Middle Ages it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter . Major rebuilding took place following a fire in the town in 1731 , after which it became a centre for cloth-making .",
      "Wellington gave its name to the first Duke of Wellington , Arthur Wellesley , who is commemorated by the nearby Wellington Monument .",
      "Following his victory at the Battle of Talavera in the Peninsular War , Arthur Wellesley was offered a peerage . The question was what title should he take . His brother , Richard Wellesley , Earl of Mornington , looked around and discovered that a manor in the parish of Wellington was available . It was also reasonably close to the family name . Because Arthur was still in Spain in command of the army fighting the French , Richard oversaw the purchase . By this process Arthur therefore became Marquess of Wellington . According to the book Wellington as Military Commander by Michael Glover , Arthur Wellesley first signed himself Wellington on 16 September 1809 . At the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 , Arthur Wellesley was already further elevated to the peerage rank of the Duke of Wellington . At the time he became Ambassador to France , The London Gazette of 4 June 1814 refers to him as having that title but suggests that it was granted by warrant on 25 August 1812 .",
      "The Grand Western Canal reached the town in 1835 and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1843 . The towns own railway station survived until 1964 . Wellington was home of Fox , Fowler and Company , which was the last commercial bank permitted to print their own sterling banknotes in England and Wales . In the 20th century closer links with Taunton meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there for work , and the M5 motorway enabled car journeys to be made more easily .",
      "Local industries , which now include an aerosol factory and bed manufacturers , are celebrated at the Wellington Museum in Fore street . Wellington is home to the independent Wellington School , and state-funded Court Fields School . It is also home to a range of cultural , sporting and religious sites including the 15th century Church of St John the Baptist .",
      "The capital city of New Zealand is named after Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , being recognised as having some influence in the company that founded the New Zealand town . The New Zealand capital therefore takes its name ultimately from the English town of Wellington in Somerset .",
      "History .",
      "In a grant of between 899 and 909 Edward the Elder gave the land then known as Weolingtun , which means wealthy estate , along with West Buckland and Bishops Lydeard to Bishop Asser . This was in exchange for the monastery of Plympton in Devon . An alternative explanation for the origin of the name is the settlement in the temple clearing . By the time of the Domesday Book of 1086 , the name had changed to Walintone and the estate was owned by Gisa ( Bishop of Wells ) . The parish of Wellington was part of the Kilmersdon Hundred ,",
      "A site at Longforth Farm near Tonedale has been identified as having Bronze Age occupation and , during excavations prior to the building of new homes , found to have been occupied by a 12th-14th century building with decorated floor tiles covering .",
      "A royal charter of 1215 gave Wellington its status as a town , and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter , being laid out with the church at the east end of town , in a similar manner to other towns of this era . In 1548 , the manor was sold to Edward Seymour , 1st Duke of Somerset , but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution . By the end of the 16th century it had come under the protection of John Popham ( judge ) and his descendants who built a manor house which was destroyed during the English Civil War .",
      "Major rebuilding took place in the town following a fire in 1731 . After this the towns importance grew as it became a centre for clothmaking across Somerset and Devon , its importance as trade centre enhanced by fires in Taunton and Tiverton . By the 1831 census , 258 people were recorded as cloth workers in Wellington .",
      "Arthur Wellesley took the title of his Marquessate in 1809 from this town of Wellington . Nearby Wellington Hill boasts a large , spotlit obelisk to his honour . The Wellington Monument is a floodlit high triangular tower designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building . It was erected to celebrate the Duke of Wellingtons victory at the Battle of Waterloo . The foundation stone was laid in 1817 on land belonging to the Duke but , owing to funding problems , the monument was not completed until 1854 . It is now owned by the National Trust who announced plans to reclad the monument at a cost of \u00a34 million in 2009 .",
      "In the 18th century turnpikes arrived in the area and then in the 19th communications improved with the Grand Western Canal reaching the town in 1835 . Wellington station was opened when the Bristol and Exeter Railway reached the town on 1 May 1843 . It was a typical Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in . This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines . These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands on the east side of the line at the Taunton end of the station , although the station closed on 5 October 1964 . Wellington was an important station as it stood at the foot of a steep incline . Banking locomotives were kept here , ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel .",
      "In the 20th century closer links with Taunton meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there for work , and the M5 motorway , which opened in sections in the 1960s and 1970s , enabled car journeys to be made more easily .",
      "Fox Fowler & Co . Bank .",
      "Thomas Fox started the Fox , Fowler and Company bank in Wellington which rapidly expanded and ran successfully , until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927 . It was the last private bank in England to issue its own notes and they were legal tender until 1964 . There are nine notes left in circulation . The British Museum have another example on display . The bank established its Head Office at the old family house in Fore Street , Wellington ( today the Lloyds Bank branch ) - they opened branches at Taunton , Bridgwater , Weston-super-Mare , Torrington , Bideford , Barnstaple , Ilfracombe and South Molton .",
      "The original \u00a35 Note is on display at Tone Dale House - one of the last nine and possible the only one left uncancelled .",
      "Governance .",
      "Wellington has three tiers of local government at parish , district and county level . The present system dates from 1 April 1974 when the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect .",
      "The lowest tier is Wellington Town Council , formed as a successor parish to Wellington Urban District Council in 1974 . The town council has 15 councillors , and is headed by a town mayor . For elections of town councillors , the town is divided into four wards : Wellington East ( returning 4 councillors ) , Wellington North ( 4 ) , Rockwell Green ( 3 ) and Wellington West ( 4 ) . The political composition of the council in November 2009 was Liberal Democrats 7 , Conservative Party 5 and Labour Party 3 . The town council provides purely local services . An area to the south of the town falls within the civil parish of Wellington Without .",
      "The middle , or district , tier of administration is the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton , which was established on 1 April 2019 . The council is based in Taunton , and consists of 59 councillors . There are three electoral wards in Wellington ( North , South and West ) . Five councillors are elected from wards in Wellington : two are Liberal Democrats , one Conservative , one Labour and one independent .",
      "The upper tier is Somerset County Council . Also based in Taunton , the council has 58 councillors , each elected for a single-member electoral division . Most of the town comprises the Wellington electoral division , with part falling in the mainly rural division of Blackdown & Wellington East . They are represented by one Labour and one Liberal Democrat councillor . Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education , social services , the library , roads , public transport , trading standards , waste disposal and strategic planning , although fire , police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service , Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service .",
      "For elections to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom , Wellington forms part of the Taunton Deane constituency . The constituency elects one Member of Parliament ( MP ) by the first past the post system of election . Following the review of parliamentary representation in Somerset , the Boundary Commission for England has created a modified Taunton constituency with the name change Taunton Deane , to reflect the district name .",
      "Geography .",
      "The town has many dependent villages including West Buckland , Langford Budville , Nynehead , Sampford Arundel and Sampford Moor . The formerly independent village of Rockwell Green , to the west of the town , has been incorporated into the town however there is still a green wedge of land in between them . Wellington Park was a gift from the Quaker Fox family to the town in 1903 as a memorial to the coronation of King Edward VII . The gardens were laid out by F.W . Meyer , who included a rock garden which used 80 tons of limestone from Westleigh quarry near Burlescombe . It is Grade II listed on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England . It was restored at a cost of \u00a3412,827 which included a grant of \u00a3296,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund Public Parks Initiative .",
      "There are Local Nature Reserves at Wellington Basins on the western fringe of the town . It includes a small pond and boardwalk with a variety of wildlife habitats . The grassland , hedges and woodland are home to a varied flora and fauna including birds such as the grey wagtail , dipper and reed bunting . Five separate bat species have been recorded at the site . Swains Pond in the south of Wellington is another Local Nature Reserve , which used to be the site of orchards . It now includes a pond which provides a home for amphibians including the great crested newt , palmate newt and toads .",
      "Climate .",
      "Wellington has an oceanic climate ( K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb ) .",
      "Along with the rest of South West England , Wellington has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country . The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures . The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common . In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England , however convective cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine . Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours . In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton . Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection . Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions , which is when they are most active . In summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms . Average rainfall is around . About 8\u201315 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , and June to August have the lightest winds . The predominant wind direction is from the south-west .",
      "Demography .",
      "The town has a population of 13,696 . Large growth occurred during the 1970s when housing developments were built on the south side of the town . These were largely prompted by Wellingtons proximity to Junction 26 of the M5 motorway .",
      "Economy .",
      "Wellingtons main industry was wool-making and in November 2009 , Deborah Meaden , best known from Dragons Den a BBC television programme , invested in the Fox Brothers Mill which produces wool cloth for Savile Row , designers and clients around the world . The Fox family established the mill in 1772 . The Tonedale mill complex includes two listed buildings , some of which were still being used until 2000 . The Princes Regeneration Trust have been supporting the Tone Mill Regeneration Partnership in attempting to preserve and regenerate the area with a mixed development for commercial and residential use . It is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage .",

This was followed by attacks on targets in the Japanese Inland Sea and on Okinawa in March . On 7 April , aircraft from CVG-82 participated in the sinking of the battleship Yamato . The Air Group then supported U.S . troops on Okinawa until June . On 17 June 1945 , CVG-82 was replaced aboard Bennington by CVG-1 , and was transported to the US aboard USS White Plains ( CVE-66 ) . During its deployment , CVG-82 was credited with the destruction of 167 Japanese aircraft in the air and 220 on the ground .

      "Supreme Council of the Armed Forces",
      "The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ; , , also Higher Council of the Armed Forces and National Defence Council ) is a statutory body of between 20 and 25 senior Egyptian military officers and is headed by Field Marshal Abdul Fatah al-Sisi and Lieutenant General Mohamed Ahmed Zaki . The council is convened only in cases of war or great internal emergencies . As a consequence of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 , SCAF assumed power to govern Egypt from departing President Hosni Mubarak on 11 February 2011 , and relinquished power on 30 June 2012 upon the start of Mohamed Morsis term as president . The Council has met regularly in times of national emergencies . During the course of the 2011 revolution , the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces met first on 9 February 2011 under the chairmanship of Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak . The Council met for the first time without the chairmanship of the president on the following day , 10 February , and issued their first press statement which signaled that the council was about to assume power which they did the following day after Mubaraks resignation . The military junta was headed by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi who served as the Minister of Defense under Mubarak , and included the service heads and other senior commanders of the Egyptian Armed Forces , namely Lt . Gen . Sami Hafez Anan , Armed Forces Chief of Staff ; Air Marshal Reda Mahmoud Hafez Mohamed , Air Force commander ; Lt . Gen . Abd El Aziz Seif-Eldeen , Commander of Air Defense ; and Vice Admiral Mohab Mamish , Navy Commander in Chief .",
      "History .",
      "The SCAF has its origins in the Free officers movement , a clandestine body of anti-British Egyptian military officers in the late 1940s that seized power in a coup-cum-revolution in 1952 . The officers organised themselves into the Revolutionary Command Council , which ruled Egypt as a junta until 1954 , when a new Constitution was introduced , and a cabinet-style government was formed . The Revolutionary Council was dissolved by the dictator-turned President Gamal Abdel Nasser , who formed the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in December 1954 , as a statutory government body , comprising 25 senior-most military officers from the Army , Navy , Air Force and Air Defence Forces , with himself as the chairman of the body . The statute ruled that the council could not convene without the presence and approval of the President as the permanent Chairman . The initiative for a meeting could only be started either by the President or the Defence Minister . Nasser intended to form this body mainly as a concession to the Army which had controlled Egypt through the Revolutionary Command Council since 1952 . The SCAF was mandated to decide policy on all matters it deemed falling under the purview of National Security . Thus , in Egypt the SCAF or more correctly the Air Force still handles the issuance of aviation licenses to private individuals and companies who want to operate any airborne vehicle in the country . Similarly , all private Radio station licenses are issued by the Army , while spectrum sale for mobile telephony are issued by the Egyptian Air Defence Forces . For building hotels and resorts along beaches and coastal areas , investors need permission from the Navy . The idea of such a body of military officers guiding matters of State security probably came to nationalist officers through the Prussian and German Supreme War Council during the First World War . However the scope of SCAFs licensing powers during peacetime allows it to wield wide economic and political influence .",
      "The SCAF convened numerous times in 1956 during the Suez Crisis , during the Yemeni Civil War between 1964 and 1967 , and throughout the period 1967 to 1974 . Between 1967 and 1974 , SCAF was composed of almost 25 senior officers , and totally controlled and planned Egypts military policy vis-a-vis Israel . After 1974 the SCAF went into semi-permanent dormancy , until it was revived in 1981 after the assassination of President Anwar Sadat .",
      "Actions .",
      "Prior to Mubaraks resignation .",
      "The Supreme Council released its first statement on Thursday , 10 February 2011 , stating that the council in affirmation and support for the legitimate demands of the people is in continuous session to consider what procedures and measures that may be taken to protect the nation . It was noted that then-president Hosni Mubarak was not present in the meeting as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , however the meeting was headed by Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi .",
      "Assuming power .",
      "The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in its third statement issued on the evening of Friday , 11 February 2011 , shortly after the announcement of Mubaraks resignation , stated that the Council is not a substitute for the legitimacy that satisfies the people . The Council addressed with all the greetings and cherished for the lives of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives to sacrifice for freedom and security of their country , and led a spokesman for the Council to salute the martyrs , an action which received wide appraise from the people . The Council also thanked President Hosni Mubarak for his work in the process of national war and in peace and on the national position in preference to the higher interest of the homeland in the same statement . In the following day , 12 February , the Council released his fourth statement , which he pledged to oversee the transition to ensure the transfer of power to a civilian government elected by the people .",
      "Transition period and political reforms .",
      "In its statement the Council indicated that it intends to suspend emergency laws that had been in effect for three decades , and move towards free and fair presidential elections , and provide for a safe transition to a free democratic order . One of their first actions was to dissolve the Parliament of Egypt , suspend the Constitution of Egypt , and an announcement of free , open presidential and parliamentary elections before the years end and within six months . However , they have not yet lifted the emergency law and has failed to live up to is promises of civilian transfer of power and implementing the demands of the revolution .",
      "The Council has also declared that Egypt is committed to all regional and international obligations and treaties . This has been widely interpreted as relating to the Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty , and has been welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .",
      "On 7 August 2011 , Field Marshal Tantawi swore in 15 new governors , 11 of whom were new to the post . Some critics complained that the new governors were appointed rather than elected , that many of them were military figures and/or members of the old regime and none of them were young , women , or Copts .",
      "Since taking power the council has overseen the trial of 16,000 people in closed military trials , including bloggers , journalists and protesters . In May 2011 , one of the members of the council , General Mamdouh Shahin , stated that the under the new constitution Egypts military should be given `some kind of insurance .. . so that it is not under the whim of a president.`",
      "The SCAF was heavily criticized following violent confrontations in October 2011 between armed soldiers at the headquarters of the state television and radio services ( known as the Maspero building ) . A group of protestors , mostly Coptic Christians , marched to the Maspiro building in downtown Cairo to protest against the burning of a church in Upper Egypt . A confrontation between the protestors and the army turned violent , resulting in the killing of over 20 protestors . State TV broadcast messages of Copts attacking the army and called on Egyptians to join the army . Armed men joined the army in attacking what had been a peaceful protest . The SCAF initially denied the army was responsible for any violence and further claimed that three soldiers had been killed by protestors , claiming that the soldiers were not carrying any live ammunition . Later , video evidence was broadcast showing army vehicles hitting groups of protestors . An editorial in The Washington Post blasted the SCAF for what it called a shameful response to the violence directed against the Coptic protestors .",
      "Despite the turbulence of the transitional period in Egypt , polls have shown that the SCAF has enjoyed wide legitimacy from the Egyptian people and general confidence in their ability to provide free elections . A poll in October 2011 showed that 91.7% of Egyptians have confidence in the SCAF to provide the conditions for free elections . The SCAF at that time had a general approval rating of 40.6% .",
      "On 24 January 2012 , Mohamed Hussein Tantawi gave a televised speech in which he announced that the state of emergency would be partially lifted the following day . Power would be handed over to the government of the elected president in June 2012 .",
      "On 16 June 2012 , just after the election of Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Islamist candidate Mohamed Morsi as President of Egypt , the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces passed legislation which gave them control over the process of drafting a new constitution and immunity from any civilian oversight .",
      "On 21 July 2020 , the Council declared an exclusion zone between the Egyptian Border and a line drawn from the Libyan towns of Sirte and Al-Jafra , promising intervention if GNA forces entered , which did so promptly leading to the Egyptian Parliament authorizing military intervention to protect the border .",

The councils vice president is the chief of staff . The new SCAFs members are 23 top military generals from the army , navy , air force , air defence as well as the head of military intelligence . It is the first time in Egypts history that the SCAF will not be headed by the president , who is , according to Egypts constitution , the chief commander of the armed forces , thus giving the military greater autonomy from civil authorities . The new constitution , passed in January , includes a transitional article which gives the president the right to appoint the defence minister but also gives the SCAF the right to approve of its leader for eight years . Thus , this gives the SCAF a constitutional status , as it had operated as a statutory body since its inception . The defence minister decides which of his aides could also become council members . The president has the right to include members in the council as well as invite the council to meet whenever necessary . The president will head meetings that he calls . The defence minister invites the council for a regular meeting every three months and whenever urgently needed . In cases of a national threat or war , the council is considered in a continuous meeting .",

      "The National Library of Serbia ( ) is the national library of Serbia , located in the capital city of Belgrade . It is the biggest library , and oldest institution in Serbia .",
      "History .",
      "In 1832 , the library was established by bookbinder Gligorije Vozarovi\u0107 in his bookstore , and its first collection consisted of gifts of publisher and bookseller Vozarovi\u0107 and other Serbian cultural figures . On 28 February 1832 , Dimitrije Davidovi\u0107 sent a letter on the organization of the library to Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 . In November of the same year , Prince Milo\u0161 ordered that one copy of each printed book be made available to the library .",
      "During World War I , the Library building and collections were damaged by bombing , so the remaining holdings were moved from Belgrade to Ni\u0161 and Kragujevac for their protection . After the War , and according to the National Library Act and the Press Law , both from 1919 , the Library became the central state Library and obtained the right to acquire an obligatory copy from all over the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . In 1925 the National Library moved into a building in the district of Kosan\u010di\u0107 Crescent only to be bombed and gutted by fire sixteen years later from the 6th to 9th April 1941 at the start of World War II .",
      "The bombing by Nazi Germanys Luftwaffe of a city officially proclaimed open , completely destroyed the Library building including a priceless book collection of 500.000 volumes , an invaluable collection of 1424 Cyrillic manuscripts and charters , a collection of old maps , medieval manuscripts and prints of roughly 1,500 items , collections of 4,000 journals as well as 1,800 newspaper titles , its rich and irreplaceable archives of Turkish documents about Serbia and the complete correspondence of distinguished figures of the cultural and political history of Serbia , and all holdings lists and catalogs . The entire national cultural heritage existing in print almost disappeared overnight .",
      "After the liberation of Belgrade in 1944 , under the changed social conditions , there was a period of intensive reconstruction of the lost collections and rapid development of the Library .",
      "After the devoted work of the Library staff , the Library again opened its doors to the public in 1947 . In 1954 , on the 150th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising , the construction of a new building for the National Library was allowed , and the new Library building ( Architect : Ivo Kurtovi\u0107 ) was opened with a special ceremony on 6 April 1973 . It is located in the Vra\u010dar municipality , sharing the naturally elevated plateau with Temple of Saint Sava , as the highest peak of that part of Belgrade .",
      "The renovation of the NLS Interior has been launched in 2007 and was ended in mid-2011 , covering the following segments : the main entrance hall for users with exhibition space , the stairway of the entrance hall for users , the toilets at the ground floor and on floor , coffee bar with the kitchen , atrium , main hall on the floor level ( floor , ceilings , lighting , information desks for users ) , all reading rooms at floor level , official entrance at the level of higher ground floor , hall and stairs , the apartment for foreign guests-researchers at the level of lower ground floor , the complete lighting of the NLS and the balconies for users at the level of the main hall and floors . The renovated area for the users was opened in September 2011 , opening its doors to many existing and new users .",
      "Nowadays , the National Library of Serbia is a modern national library . Its goals are : incorporation into the worlds information flows , recognition within the worlds family of national libraries , as well as becoming an information resource and drive for the development of Serbian society .",

      "The Air Armament Center ( AAC ) was an Air Force Materiel Command ( AFMC ) center at Eglin Air Force Base , Florida , responsible for development , acquisition , testing , and deployment of all air-delivered weapons for the U.S . Air Force . Weapon systems maintained by the center included the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile , High-speed anti-radiation missile , HARM Targeting System , Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile , Joint Direct Attack Munition , Miniature Air-Launched Decoy , Sensor Fuzed Weapon , and the Small Diameter Bomb .",
      "The Air Armament Center was inactivated as an AFMC center on July 18 , 2012 , and its functions merged into the former 96th Air Base Wing at Eglin AFB . The new organization was renamed as the 96th Test Wing ( 96 TW ) the same day as a subordinate command of the Air Force Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base , California .",
      "History .",
      "On May 15 , 1940 , the Air Corps Specialized Flying School at Eglin Field was redesignated the Air Corps Proving Ground . It was redesignated Proving Ground Command on 1 April 1942 .",
      "In 1989 , Mueller said the AAF Tactical Center was designated earlier on 16 October and that it and the subsequent AAF Center were different commands . For example , he cites AAF School of Applied Tactics , c . Mar 1942 ( redesignated AAF Tactical Center , 16 Oct 1942 ) then AAF Center , 1 June 1945 .",
      "On 27 October 1942 the United States Army Air Forces established the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics at Orlando Army Air Base , Florida . The next year , it was redesignated as the Army Air Forces Tactical Center , on 16 October 1943 . In the last days of the war , it was redesignated the Army Air Forces Center , and documentation of the period appears to indicate that the AAF Proving Ground Command at Eglin Field , Florida and the Army Air Forces Center at Orlando AAB were merged as Army Air Forces Center on 1 June 1945 .",
      "The Air Force Center was the planned USAF unit for the development of tactical policy and procedures . The Air Force Center was to be the succeeding unit to the USAAF Army Air Forces Tactical Center , established on October 28 , 1943 , and which had become the Army Air Forces Center on 1 June 1945 . Instead , the AAF Center merged into Proving Ground Command ( PGC ) to form a new Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command on 8 March 1946 . The AAF PGC was redesignated the Air Proving Ground Command on 10 July 1946 , and raised to major command status . The APGC was moved to the now renamed Eglin Air Force Base , Florida , on 1 July 1948 .",
      "Testing of weapons .",
      "APGC conducted realistic testing of new weapons as an independent organization , reporting directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and advocating a fly-before-buy approach to acquiring new systems . Such a shift , however , remained a challenge , for the Air Force continued the buy-fly-fix process that had grown from the demands of the Second World War and undervalued the importance of timely independent operational test and evaluation .",
      "APGC attempted to simulate combat conditions during its tests . It also grew in size as it acquired the systems it tested . By 1956 , Air Force regulations outlined an eight-phase test and evaluation process that did not include the APGC until phase seven . By that point in the acquisition cycle , the Air Force had often already fielded units with new systems that APGC had not yet tested . Not surprisingly , operators often experienced serious problems with these new , untested systems . This led to a misperception about the value of operational test and evaluation ( OT&E ) and APGC . Had OT&E taken place before production decisions and fielding new systems , there likely would not have been any question about the added value of independent OT&E .",
      "As a result of the doubts about the value of APGC and cuts to the defense budget , in 1957 the Air Force stripped APGC of its major command status , reduced its budget and authorized personnel , and redesignated the Command the Air Proving Ground Center , and assigned it to the Air Research and Development Command . This action meant the Air Force no longer had an independent organization that specialized in impartial operational test and evaluation .",
      "Decentralized operational testing at the major commands occurred from 1958 to 1973 . Major command emphasis was often on quick deployment rather than thorough testing and impartial evaluations . Although the Air Force streamlined OT&E from eight to three phases during this period , OT&E still came at the end of the acquisition process . In addition , as systems became more complex , and the Air Force moved to acquire systems quickly , the fly-before-buy approach fell by the wayside . The consequences became clear when a Department of Defense study found that 21 of 22 major weapons systems used in the Vietnam War from 1965 to 1970 suffered severe operational deficiencies . These results strongly stated the case for independent OT&E in the Air Force .",
      "The AAC was a focal point for the acquisition of advanced weapons systems . The center carried out scientific research , system management , production , operational performance , business management , requirements definition , customer and engineering support , technology planning , materiel identification , and field support activities .",
      "While fly-before-buy has repeatedly proven its worth in thorough testing of systems and avoidance of later problems , the Air Force even in the twenty-first century remains severely hampered by a buy-fly-fix approach . Literally billions of dollars have been spent in making weapons systems operational after they have entered squadron service . For example , the Rockwell B-1B Lancer suffered repeated such problems . When declared operational , apart from nuclear weapons , the only conventional weapon the B-1 could use were free-fall bombs .",
      "Structure through 2010 .",
      "To accomplish its mission the Air Armament Center commanded three wings through 2010 .",
      "- The 46th Test Wing conducted test and evaluation of all air-delivered weapons , navigation and guidance systems , Command and Control ( C2 ) systems , and Air Force Special Operations Command systems . The 46th Test Wing was inactivated 18 July 2012 . Effectively merged to become 96th Test Wing .",
      "- The 96th Air Base Wing provided installation support for all Eglin Air Force Base tenant units . The 96th Air Base Wing was redesignated 18 July 2012 . Effectively merged to become 96th Test Wing .",
      "- The 308th Armament Systems Wing was responsible for the development , procurement , deployment , and sustainment of air-based weaponry including the Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) , Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ( JASSM ) , Small Diameter Bomb ( SDB ) , Sensor Fuzed Weapon ( SFW ) , Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser ( WCMD ) , Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile ( AMRAAM ) , Miniature Air-Launched Decoy ( MALD ) .

      "Alex McLeish",
      "Alexander McLeish ( born 21 January 1959 ) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player . Born in Glasgow , McLeish played as a central defender for Aberdeen during their 1980s glory years , making nearly 500 League appearances for the club , and won 77 caps for Scotland .",
      "McLeish started his managerial career with spells at Motherwell and Hibernian , before guiding Rangers to two championships and five cup wins in five years . McLeish spent ten months as manager of the Scotland national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the finals of the 2008 UEFA European championship . He then resigned this post in November 2007 to become manager of Birmingham City , who were in the Premier League at the time . Though Birmingham were relegated at the end of the season , McLeish guided them back to the Premier League in 2009 . Birmingham then won the 2011 Football League Cup Final , but were relegated again from the Premier League at the end of the 2010\u201311 season .",
      "Following this relegation he resigned his post at Birmingham to become manager at their city rivals , Aston Villa . This made him the first manager to move directly from Birmingham City to Aston Villa , and only the second manager after Ron Saunders to manage both clubs . Having only narrowly avoided relegation in the 2011\u201312 Premier League season , his contract was terminated by Villa at the end of his first season . McLeish was appointed manager of Championship club Nottingham Forest in December 2012 , but left after 40 days by mutual consent . He managed Belgian Pro League club Genk in the 2014\u201315 season , and Zamalek of the Egyptian Premier League in 2016 . He then had a second stint as Scotland national team manager .",
      "In recognition of his distinguished service to Scottish sport , in 2008 McLeish was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen .",
      "Early years .",
      "McLeish was born in Duke Street Hospital , Glasgow to parents Alex , a shipyard worker , and Jean . He has younger siblings Angela and Ian . After living in the Parkhead and Kinning Park districts of the city , the family moved to Barrhead , Renfrewshire soon after McLeish had reached school age . He attended Springhill Primary , Barrhead High School \u2013 where he was one year below future Aberdeen and Scotland teammate Peter Weir \u2013 and John Neilson High School in Paisley .",
      "As a juvenile he played for Barrhead Youth Club , alongside Weir , and Glasgow United as well as training for a short period with Hamilton Accies . After a local cup final with Glasgow United in 1976 which was watched by a delegation from Aberdeen , including then manager Ally MacLeod , McLeish signed for the Pittodrie club the following day .",
      "Playing career .",
      "Club .",
      "McLeish spent the majority of his first two seasons at Aberdeen in the reserves and also had a loan spell at local Junior side Lewis United . He made his competitive debut under Billy McNeill in a New Year fixture against Dundee United on 2 January 1978 . His first major final appearance was under the management of Alex Ferguson as a substitute in a 2\u20131 defeat to Rangers in the 1978\u201379 League Cup and most of his appearances during the 1970s were as a midfielder , with Willie Garner and Doug Rougvie preferred in defence . However McLeish eventually made the centre-back position his own , and over the next seven seasons he enjoyed great success , winning eight domestic and two European trophies . Highlights included scoring in a 4\u20131 victory over Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup Final on his 200th Dons appearance , and a vital goal against Bayern Munich during the campaign leading to the European Cup Winners Cup win over Real Madrid in 1983 .",
      "During this period , McLeish formed a formidable defensive triumvirate with Willie Miller and Jim Leighton for both club and country . Even after he had won his first Scotland cap , McLeishs father asked then Aberdeen boss Alex Ferguson to persuade him to continue training as an accountant . When Ferguson left in 1986 to go to Manchester United , he tried to get McLeish to sign , but it did not work out ; he also had talks with Tottenham Hotspur . A testimonial match was arranged for McLeish in December 1988 , with the clubs Gothenburg ( Cup Winners Cup ) squad taking on an International legends team . He won the Scottish player of the year in 1990 , after a season in which Aberdeen won both domestic cups .",
      "He became captain of Aberdeen after the retirement of Willie Miller . His 692 competitive appearances for the club ranks as the second-most in its history ( 100 behind Miller , but almost 100 more than Bobby Clark ) .",
      "International .",
      "McLeish is Scotlands third most capped player , having gained 77 international caps between 1980 and 1993 . He was first capped for the Scotland under-21 team while still a reserve player at Aberdeen by his former club manager Ally MacLeod , eventually gaining six caps at that level . His full international debut came on 26 March 1980 against Portugal , manager Jock Stein playing him in midfield alongside Archie Gemmill and Graeme Souness . He played in three World Cups with Scotland , in 1982 , 1986 and 1990 . He is a member of the Scottish Football Hall of Fame , the Scotland national football team roll of honour and Scottish Televisions fan poll Scotlands Greatest Team . On the occasion of his 50th cap , against Luxembourg in 1987 , McLeish was appointed team captain for the game . His final cap came on 17 February 1993 in a 3\u20130 win over Malta at Hampden Park during the 1994 World Cup qualifiers .",
      "Management career .",
      "Motherwell .",
      "After his successful playing career he quickly went into football management with Motherwell in 1994 , one year before he retired as a player . His first season at Motherwell saw him take the Lanarkshire club to second in the Premier Division behind Walter Smiths Rangers . However , he failed to build on this success and the next two seasons were spent in relegation battles . He resigned as manager to take over at Hibernian in 1998 .",
      "Hibernian .",
      "McLeish took over a struggling Hibernian side , which was relegated from the Scottish Premier Division in 1998 despite a slight upturn in fortunes under McLeish . He then guided the Edinburgh team back to the Scottish Premier League at the first attempt by winning the First Division championship .",
      "Hibernian consolidated in their first season back in the top division , finishing mid-table and reaching the Scottish Cup semi-final . In the 2000\u201301 season , Hibs started very strongly . Eventually they had to settle for third place and a Scottish Cup final appearance . This performance attracted the attention of bigger clubs , including West Ham United and Rangers .",
      "McLeish attracted players such as Russell Latapy and former French international Franck Sauz\u00e9e to Hibs . He also helped develop young striker Kenny Miller , who would later go on to play for Scotland .",
      "During this period McLeish worked towards and was awarded a UEFA Pro Licence .",
      "Rangers .",
      "His work at Hibs was noticed , and he was linked with several moves to England , before he was appointed as Rangers manager in December 2001 after outgoing Rangers manager Dick Advocaat recommended McLeish to chairman David Murray .",
      "McLeish was an instant success at Rangers , winning both the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup in his first season , but the big prize of the league title was essentially lost before his arrival . His second season saw him go one better when he won the domestic treble , with the help of players such as Ronald de Boer and Barry Ferguson .",
      "Rangers worsening financial state saw many of his top players leave in the summer of 2003 . Celtic won the league comfortably in season 2003\u201304 , and Rangers failed to win any trophies . McLeish was consequently put under pressure from fans after his poor signings and a record run of seven consecutive Old Firm derby losses to Celtic .",
      "The high-profile Bosman signings of Jean-Alain Boumsong and Dado Pr\u0161o in the close season of 2004\u201305 gave Rangers renewed hope of regaining the title from Celtics grasp . McLeishs team won the 2005 league title on a dramatic last day , an outcome that had looked highly unlikely after Rangers fell five points behind leaders Celtic with just four games remaining .",
      "After this unexpected success , McLeish and his Rangers team headed into the 2005\u201306 SPL campaign as favourites to retain the championship . McLeish made a number of signings , including Julien Rodriguez and Ian Murray , despite having little money to spend . After a reasonable start to the season , including a win over Celtic , Rangers suffered a series of poor results between September and November . This period included a club record of 10 games without a win . However the tenth match of this run , a 1\u20131 draw with Inter Milan in the Champions League , took Rangers into the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time .",
      "Despite the poor domestic form , McLeish guided Rangers to the last 16 of the Champions League , where they were defeated on the away goals rule by Villarreal . They became the first Scottish team to progress this far in the European Cup since 1993 , and the first Scottish team to progress through a European group stage . In December , chairman David Murray publicly announced his support for McLeish . Rangers then went on a good run of results in December and January .",
      "This run of good results came to a sudden halt when they were defeated 3\u20130 by Hibernian in the Scottish Cup , prompting protests outside Ibrox against both McLeish and David Murray . On 9 February 2006 , it was announced by chairman David Murray that McLeish would be standing down as manager at the end of that season .",
      "It was later announced that he would be succeeded by former Olympique Lyonnais manager Paul Le Guen . Rangers beat Hearts 2\u20130 at Ibrox Stadium in his final match as manager .",
      "Scotland national team .",
      "McLeish said after leaving Rangers that he would not manage another Scottish club , because he felt that he had achieved everything in the Scottish game . He was linked in the media with a number of managerial positions in England while he worked as a television pundit for the BBC and Setanta Sports .",
      "McLeish took charge of the Scotland national team on 29 January 2007 . His assistants in the job were Roy Aitken and Andy Watson .",
      "McLeishs first game in charge of the national team was a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match , a 2\u20131 victory against Georgia on 24 March 2007 at Hampden Park . His second game was an away fixture against Italy on 28 March 2007 which ended in a 2\u20130 defeat .",
      "McLeishs Scotland side then went on to defeat the Faroe Islands away in June , Lithuania at home in September before recording a historic victory in Paris four days later by defeating France 1\u20130 in the Parc des Princes . James McFaddens 64th-minute strike from 30 yards was enough to earn Scotland the win and returned them to the top of Group B with three games to play . This result has been hailed as one of the Scotland national teams greatest victories . Scotlands next success was at home to Ukraine , winning 3\u20131 at Hampden on 13 October . McLeish suffered his second defeat as manager , away in Georgia on 17 October . This result left Scotland facing a decider against the World Champions , Italy . Scotland lost the game 2\u20131 , McLeishs last , and Italy qualified for the finals .",
      "Birmingham City .",
      "Premier League club Birmingham Citys approach to the SFA for permission to speak to McLeish about their managerial vacancy was refused ,",
      "but on his return on 27 November 2007 from attending the draw for 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification in South Africa , he resigned his post as manager of Scotland and was announced as Birminghams new manager the following day . His assistants with Scotland , Roy Aitken and Andy Watson , were to accompany him . McLeish said he wanted to return to working with players on a daily basis and had always harboured a desire to manage in the Premier League .",
      "He enjoyed a positive managerial debut with Birmingham , winning 3\u20132 away to Tottenham Hotspur . In the January 2008 transfer window , McLeish strengthened Birminghams squad , buying David Murphy and James McFadden and signing Argentina under-20 international Mauro Z\u00e1rate on loan , while generating funds by allowing fringe players to leave . He was unable to save Birmingham from relegation , despite the team recording an impressive 4\u20131 victory over Blackburn Rovers on the last day of the season .",
      "McLeish changed the clubs backroom staff and training procedures , appointed David Watson as goalkeeping coach , and overhauled the scouting setup , bringing in Paul Montgomery \u2013 the scout who recommended a relatively unknown Didier Drogba to West Ham United \u2013 to oversee player recruitment .",
      "On the final day of the 2008\u201309 season , McLeish secured Birminghams return to the top flight of English football at the first attempt with a 2\u20131 away victory over Reading . By mid-January 2010 , he had guided them to a 12-game unbeaten run , a club record in the top division , set a Premier League record by selecting the same starting eleven for nine consecutive games , and been named Premier League Manager of the Month for December 2009 , the first Birmingham manager to receive the award . By the end of the season McLeish had led Birmingham to ninth place , their highest finish for more than 50 years .",
      "Following Birminghams success during the 2009\u201310 season , McLeish agreed a new three-year deal with the club in September 2010 .",
      "In February 2011 , McLeish led Birmingham to victory in the League Cup , defeating favourites Arsenal 2\u20131 in the final at Wembley in what he described as relatively speaking , .. . [ his ] greatest achievement .",
      "However , a poor run of form followed the League Cup win , and Birmingham were relegated to the Championship on the last day of the 2010\u201311 season . The directors confirmed that McLeish would keep his job , and would be expected to return the club to the Premier League at the first opportunity . McLeish however opted to quit Birmingham City on 12 June 2011 by email .",
      "Aston Villa .",
      "On 17 June 2011 , Aston Villa appointed McLeish as manager , just five days after leaving their local rivals Birmingham City . There was much controversy surrounding his appointment as Birmingham City claimed McLeish was still under contract and filed a complaint against Aston Villa to the Premier League while Villa claimed McLeish was a free agent . Aston Villa fans protested outside Villa Park and anti-McLeish graffiti had to be removed from outside Villas training ground . McLeish made out of favour Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given his first signing , and then recruited winger Charles NZogbia . McLeishs first competitive game as Villa manager ended in a 0\u20130 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage . He gained his first Premier League win as manager of Villa in a 3\u20131 win over Blackburn Rovers . Following victory over Blackburn , Villa drew their next four Premier League games until winning against Wigan 2\u20130 . Aston Villa finally ended their unbeaten start with a 4\u20131 defeat away at Manchester City . McLeishs side secured a surprise win over Chelsea just before signing LA Galaxy striker Robbie Keane on loan . Keane helped to secure Villa a crucial win against rivals Wolves in a 3\u20132 victory . McLeish led the 2011\u201312 Villa team to 16th place in the Premier League , avoiding relegation by two points , and set an unwanted club record of only four home wins . McLeishs contract was terminated on 14 May , the day after the season ended . The reasons cited for his termination were the poor results and style of play used throughout his term as manager .",
      "Nottingham Forest .",
      "McLeish was appointed manager of Football League Championship club Nottingham Forest on 27 December 2012 . His first game in charge was on 29 December 2012 , a 2\u20132 draw against Crystal Palace at the City Ground , with Billy Sharp scoring an injury-time equaliser for Nottingham Forest . McLeish earned his first win as Nottingham Forest manager on 12 January 2013 , a 2\u20131 victory against Peterborough at home . McLeish took charge of his only East Midlands derby against Derby County on 19 January 2013 , drawing 1\u20131 at Pride Park .",
      "On 2 February 2013 , after a 2\u20131 defeat to former club Birmingham City on his first return to St Andrews , he refused to commit his future to Nottingham Forest and claimed he was unhappy . This came after the Nottingham Forest board pulled out of a deal to sign George Boyd on the final day of the January transfer window . On 5 February 2013 , he left the club by mutual consent .",
      "Genk .",
      "McLeish stated in November 2013 that he would like to re-enter football management in some capacity , in England , Scotland or abroad . In August 2014 , he was appointed manager of Belgian club Genk . McLeish made his managerial debut on 30 August , in which Genk drew Oostende 1\u20131 away . It was reported in March 2015 that McLeish would leave Genk at the end of the 2014\u201315 Belgian Pro League season , as the club had failed to qualify for the Championship play-offs , although they did reach Europa League play-offs .",
      "Zamalek .",
      "McLeish was appointed manager of Egyptian Premier League club Zamalek on 28 February 2016 . After a series of poor performances from the team , he was sacked on 2 May with ten matches of the season remaining .",
      "Scotland national team ( second spell ) .",
      "McLeish was reappointed Scotland manager on 16 February 2018 , on a two-year contract . Scotland won their 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League group under McLeish , but he was sacked on 18 April 2019 following a 3\u20130 defeat by Kazakhstan .",
      "Outside of football .",
      "McLeish had a cameo appearance in the Laurel and Hardy biopic Stan & Ollie , after a chance meeting with director and Aberdeen FC fan Jon S . Baird on a flight . In the film , McLeish can be briefly seen reading a newspaper in the lobby of the Savoy Hotel behind Steve Coogan .",

      "William Keith ( artist )",
      "William Keith ( November 18 , 1838 \u2013 April 13 , 1911 ) was a Scottish-American painter famous for his California landscapes . He is associated with Tonalism and the American Barbizon school . Although most of his career was spent in California , he started out in New York , made two extended study trips to Europe , and had a studio in Boston in 1871-72 and one in New York in 1880 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Keith was born in Oldmeldrum , Aberdeenshire , Scotland , where he was raised at first by his grandparents , his father having died months before he was born . William claimed to have been a direct descendant of the noble Clan Keith . He emigrated with his mother and sisters to the United States in 1850 . They settled in New York City , where he attended school for several years and became an apprentice wood engraver in 1856 . He was hired to do illustrations for Harpers Magazine . In 1858 he visited Scotland and England and briefly worked for the London Daily News . He was then offered an opportunity in San Francisco and sailed there in May 1859 .",
      "California and Europe .",
      "Upon Keiths arrival in San Francisco the job he had hoped for did not materialize , so he set up his own engraving business . He formed a partnership with Harrison Eastman in 1862 and with Durbin Van Vleck in 1864 . He first studied painting with Samuel Marsden Brookes in 1863 , and may have taken watercolor instruction from Elizabeth Emerson , whom he married in 1864 . He first exhibited his watercolors in 1866 , and they were praised by critics . His subject matter already included views of Yosemite and other High Sierra locations . By 1868 he had begun painting in oils . That year Keith was able to end his engraving career and pursue painting full-time when he received a commission from the Oregon Navigation and Railroad Company to paint scenes of the Pacific Northwest .",
      "The Keiths went to D\u00fcsseldorf , Germany , in 1869-71 , following in the footsteps of American artists such as Albert Bierstadt and Worthington Whittredge . While there , Keith studied under Albert Flamm , but also wrote enthusiastically in letters about the free , suggestive brushwork of Andreas Achenbach . He also spent time in Paris , where he admired both the old masters and the Barbizon school painters . Upon his return to the United States , he shared a studio in Boston with William Hahn from 1871 to 1872 .",
      "Friendship with John Muir .",
      "Keith then returned to California , and traveled to Yosemite Valley with a letter of introduction to John Muir . The two men became deep friends for the next 38 years . Both had been born in Scotland the same year , and they shared a love for the mountains of California . James Mitchell Clarke described their friendship as one in which deep affection and admiration were expressed through a kind of verbal boxing , counter-jibe answering jibe , counter-insult responding to insult .",
      "Epic paintings of the High Sierra , 1870s .",
      "During the 1870s Keith painted a number of six- by ten-foot panoramas , including Kings River Canyon ( Oakland Museum , originally owned by Governor Leland Stanford ) and California Alps ( Mission Inn , Riverside ) . These competed with paintings of similar size and subject matter by Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Hill .",
      "The 1880s .",
      "Keiths wife Elizabeth died in 1882 . He turned for comfort to a friend , the Swedenborgian minister Joseph Worcester , who ultimately had a strong influence on Keiths approach to landscape painting .",
      "In 1883 Keith married Mary McHenry , who was the first female graduate of Hastings Law School and a leading suffragette . For their honeymoon , they went on a painting tour of the old California missions . A few months later they traveled to the East Coast and then to Munich , where Keith was determined to learn figure and portrait painting . He primarily worked on his own , occasionally receiving criticism from artists including Carl von Marr and J . Frank Currier . They returned to San Francisco in mid 1885 .",
      "Through Joseph Worcester , Keith met the architect Daniel Burnham in Chicago while en route to Europe . Burnham became an important patron and agent , showing and selling Keith paintings to collectors in the Chicago area .",
      "In 1886 the Keiths moved into a custom-built house in Berkeley , from where he would commute to his studio in San Francisco each day . That year Keith also cruised Alaskas Inland Passage and sketched some of its glaciers .",
      "Keith painted some portraits on commission and also supplemented his income by giving painting lessons , mostly to women . Among his pupils was the miniaturist Rosa Hooper .",
      "In 1888 Keith traveled north with Muir , visiting Mount Shasta and Mount Rainier to create illustrations for Muirs Picturesque California . Muir encouraged Keith to depict mountain scenery realistically , but as Keiths artistic sense had matured , he felt free to depart from geologic reality , placing an imagined glacier or a river in a scene to enhance the beauty of the painting . The two friends argued frequently about such artistic issues . It was said that Muir said , You never saw a sunrise like that , Keith . Why in the deuce dont you imitate nature ? William would goad Muir by responding , Look here now , John , if youll go out early tomorrow morning and look toward the East youll see nature imitating my sunrise. .",
      "Keith was part of a group of friends of John Muir who met in San Francisco starting in 1889 to support the establishment of Yosemite National Park . This group went on to encourage Muir to establish an association to protect the Sierra Nevada . In 1892 , this plan was realized when the Sierra Club was founded .",
      "Later years .",
      "From the late 1880s on , Keith painted primarily in a subjective vein in which his emotional and spiritual reactions to the landscape were more important than topographical facts . He painted many woodland views that resembled those of Th\u00e9odore Rousseau and other Barbizon painters , as well as the American painter George Inness . Inness came to visit the San Francisco Bay Area in 1891 . He and Keith painted together , and Keith felt he was learning a lot and regaining an enthusiasm for painting that he had begun to lose . Innesss fame and enthusiasm for Keiths work gave a substantial boost to sales of Keiths paintings .",
      "Keiths San Francisco studio was destroyed as a result of the fires following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , which resulted in the loss of many paintings , with some accounts placing the number at several thousand . Keith , who was working primarily from his Berkeley studio-home , promised to replace all of the lost paintings despite his declining health . He remained a revered but reclusive figure in the large Berkeley art colony and refused to participate in the founding of the Berkeley Art Association in 1907 . He consistently contributed paintings to the colonys exhibitions between 1906 and 1911 . In the summer of 1906 he briefly appeared in public to support Harry W . Seawell , a drawing instructor at the University of California , in what became an embarrassing scandal . When the University forbade Seawell from using nude models in his life classes , Keith published a blunt declaration of support in the local press , proclaiming that the nude model is essential to real art .",
      "Keith did not entirely abandon realistic depictions of mountain scenery . In October 1907 , accompanied by Muir , Keith visited and painted the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park , soon to be dammed to create a reservoir to provide water and power for San Francisco . Linnie Marsh Wolfe wrote that Keith left behind all his synthetics of the last twenty-five years and humbly , reverently portrayed what he saw , as objectively as in the seventies when Muir first infused into him his own spirit and vision . Keith expressed great annoyance with the many high-quality forgeries of his work on the San Francisco market .",
      "Death .",
      "Keith died in his home at 2207 Atherton Street in Berkeley , California in 1911 . He is buried in plot 14b at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland .",
      "Legacy .",
      "- Saint Marys College of California in Moraga owns more than 180 paintings by William Keith . The collection was started by Brother Fidelis Cornelius , a Christian Brother who taught art at the college and who wrote a 900-page , 2-volume biography , William Keith , Old Master of California . Two thematic exhibitions of his work are held each year in the Keith Room of the Saint Marys College Museum of Art ( formerly the Hearst Art Gallery ) .",

      "John Francis Charles , 7th Count de Salis-Soglio",
      "Sir John Francis Charles de Salis , 7th Count de Salis ( 19 July 1864 \u2013 14 January 1939 ) was an Anglo-Irish British diplomat and landowner",
      "Family background .",
      "He was the elder son of Count John Francis William de Salis ( 1825\u20131871 ) , a diplomat and numismatist of Hillingdon , and Amelia Frances Harriet ( 1837 \u2013 8 January 1885 ) , eldest daughter of Christopher Tower , JP DL MP , ( 1800\u201384 ) , of Huntsmoor Park , Iver , Buckinghamshire , and of Weald Hall , Essex .",
      "Diplomatic career .",
      "After being educated at Eton ( 1877\u20131882 , Edward Compton Austen Leighs house ) he was nominated an attach\u00e9 in the diplomatic service on 20 November 1886 . He passed a competitive examination on 14 January 1887 . On 12 June 1888 he was appointed to Brussels as an attach\u00e9 and promoted to Third Secretary on 14 January 1889 . From 24 April 1892 he served in Madrid , and was promoted to Second Secretary on 22 August 1893 . From August 1894 he served in Cairo under Lord Cromer in charge of the agency there when the Dervishes were active ( he was granted an allowance for knowledge of Arabic on 2 April 1895 ) . In autumn 1897 he was in Berlin , in 1899 in Brussels and from 1901 in Athens , as head of chancery ( dealing with the Macedonian problem ) . He was promoted to First Secretary on 1 April 1904 . He was employed between 1901\u201306 at the Foreign Office in London , and appointed a British Delegate for negotiation of a new Commercial Convention with Romania on 7 September 1905 . He served as Berlin charg\u00e9 daffaires and counsellor of embassy from 1 July 1906 to 1911 , and was a British delegate at the International Copyright Conference at Berlin , October\u2013November 1908 . From November 1911 to 1916 he served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the King of Montenegro at Cettinj\u00e9 , and was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary on a special mission to the Holy See in 1916\u20131923 , ( Pope Benedict XV 1916-1922 , and same to Pope Pius XI 1922-1923 ) . He was a member of the 1931 Malta Royal Commission ( report issued in a blue book , 11 February 1932 ) .",
      "De Salis Report .",
      "In 1919 the British Government sent de Salis to investigate the Serbian occupation of Montenegro , but his resulting report was suppressed . Alexander Devine in The Martyred Nation , 1924 wrote : The fact is the Report contains such a damning indictment of Serbian rule that its publication would immediately provoke interference ; and that interference did not suit our policy towards the French Government .",
      "In the House of Commons , Ronald McNeill repeatedly asked about production of the Report and De Saliss possible arrest . But as Devine put it : When the day came that Mr . McNeill found himself Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the late Conservative Ministry , the Report was on his desk in the Foreign Office and Mr . McNeill could no more disclose its contents than his predecessors could . Meanwhile , Lord Sydenham in the House of Lords , Hansard , 29 November 1920 said :",
      "In a letter , dated New York , 1 May 1922 , published in The New York Times , 7 May 1922 , Ronald Tree described the Count as :",
      "..perhaps the greatest English authority on the Balkans .",
      "In April 1920 , months after the possible event , an alleged arrest and imprisonment by the Serbians , the New York Times reported :",
      "The sensitivity of the issue is shown by the fact that only one of his four obituaries in The Times ( 1939 ) ( 19 January 1939 , page 17 , column D ) mentions his Montenegran Report , although not the arrest .",
      "Marriage .",
      "He married in 1890 H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Marie de Riquet , Comtesse de Caraman-Chimay ( 18 August 1864 \u2013 31 May 1902 ) , daughter of Marie Eug\u00e8ne Auguste de Riquet , Prince de Caraman-Chimay , son of Joseph de Riquet de Caraman ( 1808-1886 ) , 17th Prince de Chimay and 1st Prince de Caraman .",

The coat of arms refers to the 14th century St . Mary Church of Sastamala . The explanation of the coat of arms is \u201cin the blue field , a golden consecration cross with a crossed edge\u201d . The coat of arms was designed by Lauri Ahlgr\u00e9n .",
      "History .",
      "The stone grave with its swords , dating to the 4th century in Ristim\u00e4ki , Vammala , is reminiscent of the prosperous armed burials of the younger Roman Iron Age ( 200\u2013400 AD ) in coastal areas . It is also the only inland tomb corresponding to the coastal burial tradition at that time . During the Vendel Period , cemeteries became more common in the Sastamala area , which contributes to population growth and population density . The parish of Sastamala was the largest parish belonging to the historical province of Satakunta .",
      "The name Sastamala first appeared in the form Sastamall in a letter from King Birger Magnusson from 1300 or 1303 .",
      "Geography .",
      "Sastamala is located on both sides of the Kokem\u00e4ki Rivers watershed in the southwest corner of Pirkanmaa . The municipality is divided by Kokem\u00e4ki River , Lake Liekovesi , Lake Rautavesi and Lake Kulovesi . Other significant severe waters in the municipality are Lake Houha , Lake Ylinen , Lake Kiikoinen and Lake Mouhij\u00e4rvi .",
      "There are a total of 161 villages in Sastamala , and two thirds of the municipalitys population lives in rural areas and villages . The villages are organized into more than 40 village associations . The division of the village was created by the Great Partition in the 18th century and thus does not fully correspond to the current situation ; for example , Illo and Putaja are located on the lands of other villages and are not listed .",

Department of Energys Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) . She was part of ORNLs team that collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to discover tennessine ( element 117 ) . The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ; which , among other responsibilities , coordinates with laboratories and the public for the naming of new chemical elements ) , recognizes her as the first African-American woman to be involved with the discovery of a chemical element . Phelps was formerly in the US Navy Nuclear Power Program . At ORNL , Phelps manages programs in the Department of Energys Isotope & Fuel Cycle Technology Division investigating industrial uses of nickel-63 and selenium-75 .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Clarice Phelps was raised in the state of Tennessee , United States . Her interest in chemistry began during her childhood when she was given a microscope and encyclopedia-based science kit by her mother . Her interest was further nurtured by her secondary school science teachers . She is an alumna of the Tennessee Aquatic Project and Development Group , a nonprofit organization for at-risk youth . Phelps completed a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Tennessee State University in 2003 .",
      "Career .",
      "United States Navy .",
      "Phelps struggled academically in college . Unable to find employment after graduating , she joined the United States Navy . Phelps enrolled in the Navys Nuclear Power School , which she credits with teaching her how to study . Phelps studied nuclear power , reactor theory , and thermodynamics , and graduated in the top 10% of her class of 300\u2013400 students . Phelps told an interviewer in 2019 that she pursued nuclear chemistry in part because of the lack of black women in the field .",
      "Phelps served as a non-commissioned officer in the United States Navy Nuclear Power Program . She spent four and a half years aboard the aircraft carrier , operating the nuclear reactor and steam generator chemistry controls , and maintaining the water in the reactor . She was deployed twice , and was the only black woman in her division on the ship .",
      "Oak Ridge National Laboratory .",
      "After serving in the US Navy , Phelps worked at chemical instrument company Cole-Parmer in Chicago , Illinois , but a year later , not liking the cold Chicago climate , she returned to Tennessee . In June 2009 , Phelps joined Oak Ridge National Laboratory . She started as a technician and was later promoted to research associate and program manager . Phelps works in the Nuclear Science and Engineering Directorate as the project manager for the nickel-63 and selenium-75 industrial isotope programs . As a member of Oak Ridges Nuclear Materials Processing Group , she is part of the research and development staff , working with super heavy transuranic isotopes that are produced mainly by nuclear transmutation . She is also a member of the Medical , Industrial and Research Isotopes Group , where she researches elements such as actinium , lanthanum , europium , and samarium .",
      "Phelps was involved in the discovery of the second-heaviest known element , tennessine ( element 117 ) . She was part of a three-month process to purify 22 mg of berkelium-249 , which was shipped to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and combined with calcium-48 in a fusion reaction to create tennessine . In IUPACs crediting Oak Ridge laboratory collectively as principal co-discoverer of tennessine , it acknowledged 61 individuals at ORNL who had contributed to the project including members of operations staff , support personnel , and researchers such as Phelps . It recognized Phelps as the first African-American woman involved with the discovery of a chemical element .",
      "Phelps has contributed to additional research efforts , including those of spectroscopic analysis and spectrophotometric valence state studies of plutonium-238 and neptunium-237 and 238 for the National Aeronautic and Space Administration ( NASA ) . Phelps has also studied electrodeposition with californium-252 for the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade project .",
      "Phelps is a member of the American Chemical Society .",
      "Science outreach ; awards and recognition .",
      "Phelps is involved in several outreach projects to increase youth participation in the fields of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( STEM ) . She serves on ORNLs Educational Outreach Committee as its diversity chair for Knox County Schools . She has done outreach through the ASCEND program of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sororitys graduate chapter , establishing a program to teach robotics , drones , circuitry , and coding to inner city high school students in Knoxville . Phelps is also the Vice President of the board of Youth Outreach in Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics ( YO-STEM ) .",
      "Phelps was featured on the Oak Ridge Associated Universities STEM stories program , partnering with nearby schools in Tennessee . Phelps received the 2017 YWCA Knoxville Tribute to Women Award in the category Technology , Research , and Innovation . This award recognizes local women who lead their fields in technology and excel in community service .",
      "In 2019 , the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) featured Phelps in the Periodic Table of Younger Chemists in recognition of her outstanding commitment to research and public engagement , as well as being an important advocate for diversity . She was one of two Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers thus honored . Phelps is associated on this honorary periodic table with the element einsteinium ( note that she , along with others , including Julie Ezold , researched purification of einsteinium-254 ) and her fellow awardee , the post-doctoral researcher Nathan Brewer of Oak Ridge laboratorys Physics Division , is associated with the element tennessine . Their inclusion follows a competition by the IUPAC and the International Younger Chemists Network ( IYCN ) .",
      "At the December 6 , 2019 TEDxNashvilleWomen , Phelps presented the talk How I Claimed a Seat at the Periodic Table , where , according to TED Talks , she debunk [ ed ] the myth of solitary genius and challenge [ d ] institutional elitism by sharing stories of women of color making their way in science .",

      "Louis Francis Salzman",
      "Louis Francis Salzman ( 26 March 1878 \u2013 4 April 1971 ) was a British economic historian who specialised in the medieval period .",
      "He was born in Brighton in 1878 , the son of Dr . F . W . Salzmann , and educated at Haileybury College and Pembroke College , Cambridge . He studied natural sciences , aiming to make a career in medicine ; however , after inheriting a small private income , he gave this up to work in history .",
      "He married Maud Russell in 1904 , and had two sons and two daughters . He did not serve in the First World War , through ill-health ; he taught at St Georges School , Harpenden from 1916 to 1918 . In 1918 he moved to Cambridge , and there tutored students . In 1934 , his marriage to Maud was dissolved , and he moved to London , shortly thereafter moving to Lewes in Sussex , where he lived to his death .",
      "His first book , The History of the Parish of Hailsham , was published in 1901 . He then began his work in economic history , writing on Sussex industries for the Victoria County History . In 1913 he published English Industries of the Middle Ages , and in 1931 English Trade in the Middle Ages . The building industry had been omitted from English Industries , though it was touched on in an enlarged edition ten years later , and in 1952 he produced A Documentary History of Building in England Down to 1540 , a comprehensive study of both the practical and organisational aspects of the industry . In 1934 Salzman succeeded W.H . Page as general editor of the Victoria County History . He held the post until 1949 , overseeing the production of fifteen volumes , covering Oxfordshire and Warwickshire as well as Sussex , and was succeeded by Ralph Pugh .",
      "Salzmans other academic works included biographies of Henry II ( 1914 ) and Edward I ( 1968 ) , as well as the general studies English Life in the Middle Ages ( 1926 ) , England in Tudor Times ( 1926 ) , and A Survey of English History ( 1930 ) . He wrote a pair of popular collections \u2013 Medieval Byways ( 1913 ) and More Medieval Byways ( 1926 ) \u2013 of short essays on individual topics , cookery or memories , built around extracts from contemporary records and providing an insight into medieval life seen from an unusual angle . In 1926 he published a play , The Girdle of Venus .",
      "In 1909 he became the honorary editor of the Sussex Archaeological Societys annual journal , a post he would hold for the next fifty years . He was president of the society from 1954 to 1956 , and published a history of it in 1946 . In 1955 , he was appointed as a Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire , and in 1965 awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Sussex .",

      "Design and construction .",
      "In 1938 , the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board ( ACNB ) identified the need for a general purpose local defence vessel capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties , while easy to construct and operate . The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons , a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel , with a top speed , and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun , equipped with asdic , and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations : although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel , the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels . Construction of the prototype did not go ahead , but the plans were retained . The need for locally built all-rounder vessels at the start of World War II saw the Australian Minesweepers ( designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability , but popularly referred to as corvettes ) approved in September 1939 , with 60 constructed during the course of the war : 36 ordered by the RAN , 20 ( including Cairns ) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels , and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy .",
      "Cairns was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough , Queensland on 31 March 1941 . She was launched on 7 October 1941 by Mrs . R . D . Walker , wife of the Works Manager of Walkers Limited , and commissioned into the RAN on 11 May 1942 .",
      "Operational history .",
      "Royal Australian Navy .",
      "From entering service until 16 October 1942 , Cairns was based in Fremantle and operated as a convoy escort , anti-submarine patroller , and minesweeper . On 16 October , the corvette was reassigned to the British Eastern Fleet and ordered to Kilindini , Kenya , arriving on 14 November .",
      "Cairns remained with the Eastern Fleet until January 1945 . Most of this time was spent on patrol or escort duties in the Indian Ocean . The corvette was reassigned to the Mediterranean from June until September 1943 . During this time , Cairns was involved in the Allied invasion of Sicily . On 11 February 1944 , a convoy Cairns was assigned to was attacked by Japanese submarine RO-110 . The corvette was involved in the successful destruction of the submarine , but one convoy ship was torpedoed . Following a refit in Adelaide from May to July 1944 , Cairns was redeployed to Colombo , which was her base of operations until January 1945 , when the corvette was sent back to Australia .",
      "On arrival in Australian waters , Cairns was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet .",
      "The ship received four battle honours for her wartime service : Pacific 1942\u201345 , Indian Ocean 1942\u201345 , Sicily 1943 , and Okinawa 1945 .",
      "Royal Netherlands Navy .",
      "Following the end of World War II , all Admiralty-owned Bathurst class corvettes were disposed of . Cairns was paid off in Brisbane on 17 January 1946 . She was immediately recommissioned into the Royal Netherlands Navy ( RNLN ) and renamed HNLMS Ambon .",

      "Jan Anthonie Coxie or Anthonie Coxie ( c . 1660 - 1720 ) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman mainly known for his portrait and history paintings . After starting his career in Flanders he moved abroad and worked in Amsterdam , Berlin , Mainz and Milan where he worked for an elite clientele .",
      "Life .",
      "Coxie was born in Mechelen some time between 1650 and 1670 in an artistic family with a long tradition going back to the 16th century . His father was the landscape painter Jan Coxie who was a great grandson of Michiel Coxie , one of the leading Flemish Renaissance painters who was known as the Flemish Raphael . His father Jan married Jeanne Biset in 1650 or in 1667 according to different sources . Jan Anthonie had a brother , Jan Michiel , who also became a painter and with whom he is sometimes confused .",
      "Jan Anthonie studied with his father as well as with the prominent painter Charles Emmanuel Biset . Charles Emmanuel Biset was the brother of Jeanne Biset ( Jan Anthonie\u2019s mother ) and director of the Academy of Antwerp .",
      "Jan Anthonie commenced his career in Mechelen around the year 1691 . That year he was commissioned by the city of Mechelen to make a portrait of Charles II of Spain , the last Habsburg ruler of Spain and also ruler of the Southern Netherlands . In 1698 he painted the figures in a landscape made by Jacques dArthois for the St . James Church in Bruges .",
      "From 1699 onwards he is recorded in Amsterdam . In 1703 he became poorter of Amsterdam . Wybrand de Geest ( II ) was his pupil . De Geest published in 1702 a book with engravings of Antique sculptures under the title Het Kabinet der Statuen ons van d\u2019Aloudheid Nagelaten , which he dedicated to his master and friend Coxie . It is believed that Jan Anthonie Coxie is the Coxie that the early Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken claimed had painted the grisaille representations of the liberal arts on the panels that covered a tryptich made by Gerard Dou . This tryptich was in the collection of William I of the Netherlands , but is now lost although a copy by Willem Joseph Laquy exists . The grisaille paintings by Coxie made clear that the three paintings by Gerard Dou , which depicted genre scenes , were in fact allegories of the liberal arts .",
      "Although successful as testified by the praises sung of his work by local poets Sybrand Feitama and Fran\u00e7ois Halma , he left Amsterdam and is recorded in Berlin from 1705 to 1708 . He became the court painter of Frederick I of Prussia and decorated the ceilings of Charlottenburg Palace , the Berlin Palace and other residences of Frederick I with allegorical scenes praising the deeds of the king . He painted the walls and an altarpiece in the Chapel at Charlottenburg Palace .",
      "After the death of his patron , Coxie left Berlin for Mainz in 1713 . Here he worked for the court . He did not stay in Mainz for long but moved around 1713 to Milan . He was known in Italy as Mons\u00f9 Coixe . He would remain active in Lombardia until his death , probably in Milan , in 1720 .",
      "Work .",
      "He painted portraits as well as historical and allegorical paintings . His style is regarded as following that of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck . Whilst in Italy he produced copies after the work of these two leading Flemish Baroque artists . He was regarded as a capable draughtsman .",
      "One of his masterpieces produced during his early career in Flanders is the large Group Portrait of the FaydHerbe Family in an Architectural Setting ( in a private collection ) of 1693 . From his Amsterdam period , mainly portraits of prominent personalities such as the Portrait of Nicolaas van der Meer ( Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht ) and the Portrait of Antoni de Mestral ( Bredas Museum ) have been preserved .",
      "Of the works from his Berlin period , the ceiling frescos he painted for the porcelain room in the Charlottenburg Palace are his best known . The frescos can be regarded as propaganda for the glorious rule of Frederick I . They represent Aurora , the Goddess of Dawn , in her seven-horsed chariot chasing away Night and clearing the way for the Sun-God Apollo , who approaches in his chariot in a blaze of light . Hovering overhead , Mercury heralds the arrival of the life-giving god and Saturn ushers in the Golden Age with his scythe . He also included images of the Four Continents as well as the Four Seasons , which are familiar allusions to political power and thus affirm the greatness of Frederick I ."

It is the French counterpart to the US State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff . It is currently headed by diplomat Manuel Lafont Rapnouil , who was appointed by Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in July 2019 .",
      "Status .",
      "The director of the CAPS reports directly to the Minister and is sometimes a member of his cabinet . The CAPS is tasked with performing three tasks with complete independence of approach and expression :",
      "- analysing the evolutions of international relations and the larger problems which weigh on them in the middle and in the long term , notably economic , religious and demographic issues , all the while seeking to shed light on them from an approach combining multiple social sciences as well as foresight ;",
      "- recommending to the Minister , either on his instructions or under its own steam , such action or strategic options as it deems necessary with regard to the development of the international situation in the long term ;",
      "- ensuring that the relationship between the administration and the academic world is well oiled , by presenting administration officials with research relevant to their work and also by emphasising the importance of French institutions abroad .",
      "In spite of its small size , the Centre enjoys a solid reputation and has become known the world over for being a breeding ground of intellectual and diplomatic talent .",
      "Its PIPA program ( Programme d\u2019invitation des personnalit\u00e9s d\u2019avenir \u2013 an invitation program for young foreign leaders ) , established in 1989 , which hosts about 75 young leaders ( under 45 ) a year , seeks to present the select few who are chosen with an unvarnished image of contemporary France and establish friendly ties with them . Since its creation , the program has hosted over 2,000 personalities from over 150 countries .",
      "Independence .",
      "The CAPS is made quite unique by the diversity of its team : it is made up of career diplomats , but also civil servants from different ministries , most often Defence and Finance , academics and other experts . Its specificity is particularly marked in the manner with which its team handles topics : indeed , its officials frequently assess situations by using data that originates out of the traditional diplomatic channels , whether in universities , think tanks or specialised services at home or abroad . It also has the resources necessary to commission expert analyses from external sources .",
      "This makes it a source of independent and sometimes critical analyses vis-\u00e0-vis the government\u2019s policies . It is for instance mentioned for its dissenting analyses , carried out by external consultants , in the Duclert report on France , Rwanda and the Tutsi genocide . Its mission is also to present alternatives and new options and ideas . It has a certain liberty of speech outside of the administration , and its members frequently publish and partake in conferences , activities which serve to heighten its status on the international scene .",
      "History .",
      "The Centre d\u2019analyse et de pr\u00e9vision , as it was first called , was set up on 18 May 1974 by then-Foreign Minister Michel Jobert , who wanted to implement some institutionalised out-of-the-box thought . The decree establishing its existence states its purpose as \u201ccontributing to the preparation of decisions in foreign affairs\u201d by \u201canalysing current situations\u201d and \u201cconducting attempts at foreseeing future evolutions\u201d .

In 1955 he became Regius Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow , in 1957 he was appointed professor of organic chemistry at Imperial College . In 1950 , Barton showed that organic molecules could be assigned a preferred conformation based upon results accumulated by chemical physicists , in particular by Odd Hassel . Using this new technique of conformational analysis , he later determined the geometry of many other natural product molecules . In 1969 , Barton shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Odd Hassel for contributions to the development of the concept of conformation and its application in chemistry .",

      "SMS Cormoran ( 1909 )",
      "SMS Cormoran or SMS Cormoran II was a German armed merchant raider that was originally a Russian merchant vessel named Ryazan . The ship was active in the Pacific Ocean during World War I . Built in 1909 , she was captured by the German light cruiser on 4 August 1914 and converted into a raider at the German colony Kiautschou . She was forced to seek port at Apra Harbor on the U.S . territory of Guam on 10 August 1914 . The United States , then declared neutral in the war , refused to sufficient provisions to allow Cormoran to make a German port . After the U.S . declaration of war on April 6 , 1917 , the Naval Governor of Guam informed Cormoran that she would be seized as a hostile combatant , prompting her crew to scuttle her .",
      "History .",
      "Ryazan was built at the Schichau shipyard in Elbing , Imperial Germany in 1909 for the Russian merchant fleet ( Rjasan or Rj\u00e4san , from the Russian town of Ryazan ) . She was used by imperial Russia as a combination passenger , cargo and mail carrier on North Pacific routes .",
      "German capture .",
      "The Ryazan was captured southeast of the Korean peninsula by the German light cruiser on 4 August 1914 as the first prize of World War I from the Russian empire . She was taken to Tsingtao in the German colony Kiautschou , where she was converted to an armed merchant raider . The new Cormoran replaced the original SMS Cormoran , a small shallow draft cruiser that had a long Imperial Navy career in the Pacific , having taken part in the events that brought Kiautschou into the German colonial empire in 1897\u201398 . The old Cormoran was laid up at Tsingtao with serious maintenance issues and unable to go to sea , and her armaments were transferred to the captured merchant ship .",
      "On 10 August 1914 , the new Cormoran ( or Cormoran II ) left Tsingtao harbor and sailed through the South Pacific region . After Japan declared war on the German Empire , her warships discovered and pursued the Cormoran , forcing her to seek refuge in Apra Harbor , in the U.S . Territory of Guam , on 14 December . Having expended most of her fuel raiding commerce , her crew burned much of her woodwork in the boilers in order to make port . With only of coal remaining in her bunkers , her captain requested provisions and of coal in order to reach German ports in East Africa .",
      "Due to strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany , plus the limited amount of coal stored at Guam , Governor William John Maxwell refused to supply Cormoran with more than a token amount of coal . He ordered the ship to leave within 24 hours or submit to detention . This created a standoff between the German crew and the Americans that lasted nearly two years , until Governor Maxwell was involuntarily placed on the sick list and replaced by his subordinate , William P . Cronan , who decided the German crew should be treated as guests of the United States . The Cormoran was not allowed to leave the harbor , but the crew were treated as friends , achieving a minor celebrity status on the island .",
      "Scuttling .",
      "On the morning of April 7 , 1917 word reached Guam by telegraph cable that the U.S . Congress had declared war on Germany . The Naval Governor of Guam , Roy Campbell Smith , sent two officers to inform the Cormoran that a state of war existed between the two countries , that the crew were now prisoners of war , and that the ship must be surrendered . Meanwhile , the USS Supply blocked the entrance to Apra Harbor to prevent any attempt to flee . In a separate boat , the two officers were accompanied by a barge commanded by Lt . W.A . Hall , who was designated prize master , and had brought 18 sailors and 15 Marines from the barracks at Sumay . Seeing a launch from Cormoran hauling a barge of supplies back shore , Hall ordered shots fired across the bow of the launch until it hove to . Meanwhile , the two officers reached Cormoran and informed Captain Adalbert Zuckschwerdt of the situation . Zuckschwerdt agreed to surrender his crew but refused to turn over the ship . The U.S . officers informed Zuckschwerdt that the Cormoran would be treated as an enemy combatant and left to inform Governor Smith of the situation . Unbeknownst to the Americans , the Germans had secreted an explosive device in the ships coal bunker . Minutes after the Americans left , an explosion aboard Cormoran hurtled debris across the harbor and her crew began abandoning ship . The two American boats and USS Supply immediately began to recover German sailors from the water , saving all but seven of the roughly 370 Cormoran crew . This incident , including the warning shots against the launch , accounted for the first violent action of the United States in World War I , first shots fired by the U.S . against Germany in WWI , the first German prisoners of war captured by the U.S. , and the first Germans killed in action by the U.S . in WWI . The shots ordered fired by Te\u00f3filo Marxuach against the SS Odenwald in San Juan Bay on March 21 , 1915 predate the U.S . declaration of war against Germany .",
      "The dead crew were buried with full military honors in the naval cemetery at Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a . After the American sailors rescued and made prisoners the surviving Germans , Governor Cronan congratulated Captain Zuckschwerdt for the bravery of his men . The U.S . Navy later conducted a limited salvage operation and the ships bell was recovered . It is exhibited at the U.S . Naval Academy Museum at Annapolis , Maryland . Other artifacts have been removed by divers over the years .",
      "As the crew waited to be sent to a POW camp on the mainland , they were given permission to erect an obelisk next to their buried dead . Capt . Zuckschwerd was allowed to speak at a ceremony honoring their dead . The obelisk reads , Den Toten von S.M.S . Cormoran , 7 IV 1917 , meaning To the dead of the S.M.S . Cormoran , 7 April 1917 .",
      "The German crew was initially imprisoned in Fort Douglas , Utah . In April 1918 , all remaining prisoners of war from Cormoran and were transferred from Fort Douglas to Fort McPherson , Georgia . All returned home on 7 October 1919 , almost a year after the wars end .",
      "Wreck and commemorations .",
      "The wreck of the Cormoran II rests below the surface on her starboard side . A Japanese cargo ship , the Tokai Maru , sunk by the submarine USS Snapper on August 27 , 1943 , leans against her screw . The wreck is one of the few places where a World War I shipwreck lies next to a ship from World War II .",
      "In 1974 , the Cormoran monument in the Naval Cemetery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places ( NHRP ) . In 1975 , the wreck itself was placed on the NHRP because of her association with World War I . The National Park Service conducted surveys in 1983 of the SMS Cormoran and Tokai Maru , publishing maps of the two ships positions . In 1988 , a mooring buoy was attached to the Tokai Maru to allow easier access by divers . It is , according to the National Park Service , probably the most popular wreck diving site on Guam . Over one thousand divers annually visit the wrecks .",
      "The 90th anniversary of the Cormorans scuttling in 2007 was marked by wreath-laying ceremonies and exhibits and lectures as War in the Pacific National Historic Park . The centenary commemoration of the ships sinking was attended by a representative of the German embassy to Manila . Divers laid wreaths on the wreck and then a memorial ceremony was held at the Naval Cemetery ."

      "Rheidol , formerly named Treze de Maio and Talybont , was a steam locomotive built by W.G . Bagnall in Staffordshire , England , in 1896 . Originally built to a gauge of , it was ordered to work at a Brazilian sugar plantation , however the order was cancelled before it was exported . The locomotive was then regauged and renamed to work on the -gauge Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway , in Wales , where the locomotive worked from August 1897 until 1899 . It was then regauged and renamed a second time , to work on the -gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway , which it did from 1900 until 1924 , when it was scrapped .",
      "Construction .",
      "The locomotive was originally built by W.G . Bagnalls in 1896 , following an order for a gauge locomotive for a sugar plantation in Brazil . The locomotive was named Treze de Maio ( Portuguese for Thirteenth of May ) , the date that Brazil had abolished slavery in 1888 . It was constructed as a locomotive with outside frames , and fitted with a spark arresting chimney . It was completed and named by February 1897 , but the order was cancelled before the loco was exported . This may have been due to a political uprising in Brazil , though this is disputed by railway historian EA Wade .",
      "Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway .",
      "The Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway was a short-lived railway built in 1897 , operating from Llanfihangel via Talybont to serve lead mines in Mid-Wales . The railways first locomotive , Victoria , was of an unusual design , and not sufficiently powerful to operate on the railway , and therefore the owners of the line approached Bagnalls to provide a new locomotive urgently ( Bagnalls also supplied their works number 1510 , Hafan , to work the upper section of the tramway ) . As Treze de Maio was available it was regauged and renamed Talybont , and delivered to the Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway in August 1897 , still with its spark arresting chimney .",
      "The Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway was not an economic success , and closed in 1899 , just two years after opening . Talybont was then sold back to Bagnalls .",
      "Vale of Rheidol Railway .",
      "The Vale of Rheidol Railway is a railway that operates between Aberystwyth and Devils Bridge , a few miles south of the route used by the Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway . Construction of the line started in 1900 , and Talybont was sold to the contractors working on the line , Pethick Bros of Plymouth . The locomotive underwent a second change of gauge , and modification work was also carried out to its cylinders . After completion of the line in 1902 , the locomotive was returned to Bagnalls for further modifications , before it was named Rheidol and became the railways No . 3 . It was the lines only loco small enough to work the railways Harbour Branch .",
      "In 1904 , the locomotive was fitted with a conventional chimney , and at some point was fitted with a steel cab back . The Vale of Rheidol Railway was taken over by the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) in 1923 and the locomotive was allocated the number 1198 . Rheidol was withdrawn in 1923 and scrapped at Swindon Works in 1924 , having never carried its GWR number ."

      "Chelsea .",
      "Sidwell joined Chelsea on 1 July 2007 on a free transfer from Reading , and was given squad number 9 for the 2007\u201308 season .

      "On 9 November 2008 Sidwell scored against Middlesbrough but then gifted Tuncay a late goal with a poor back pass as Villa lost 2\u20131 . He was backed by Villa captain Martin Laursen to move on from his mistake . Sidwell scored his third goal of the season just 34 seconds into against Everton on 7 December 2008 , Villa went on to win 3\u20132 . Sidwell was sent-off against Hamburger SV in the UEFA Cup on 17 December 2008 for two-bookable offences . Sidwell picked up a hamstring injury against CSKA Moscow on 26 February 2009 .

      "Villa had a mixed start to the 2009\u201310 season as they were knocked out of Europe by SK Rapid Wien but then went on to beat Liverpool 3\u20131 at Anfield . Sidwell was used sparingly by manager Martin ONeill throughout 2009\u201310 as Sidwell made 33 appearances with 19 of those coming as a substitute . Sidwell missed the start of the 2010\u201311 season with an Achilles tendon injury . Upon his return from injury he was involved in a challenge which left Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Adl\u00e8ne Guedioura with a broken leg . In November 2010 Sidwell again suffered an Achilles tendon injury which ruled him out for six weeks . In January 2011 Sidwell was close to a transfer to West Ham United but the move was cancelled as it would have breached the Premier Leagues 25-man squad rule . Sidwell also held talks with Wolverhampton Wanderers before agreeing to join Fulham .",
      "Fulham .",
      "Sidwell signed for Chelsea rivals Fulham on 7 January 2011 , signing a six-month contract with a view to extending it for a further three years . He made his debut for Fulham on 22 January 2011 in a 2\u20130 win against Stoke City . On 18 April 2011 , Sidwells contract was extended until the summer of 2014 . Sidwell ended the 2010\u201311 season with goals against Liverpool and Arsenal . In 2011\u201312 Sidwell played in 28 matches in all competitions before his season was ended in February 2012 due to a hernia injury .

He scored late goals against West Bromwich Albion and Everton . Fulham went on to have an uneventful 2012\u201313 season as they finished in 12th position with 43 points , Sidwell playing in 31 matches . Sidwell did have poor end to his campaign as he was sent-off on 1 April 2013 against Queens Park Rangers for a late tackle on Armand Traor\u00e9 .",
      "After returning from suspension against Arsenal on 20 April 2013 he was again sent-off this time for a lunge on Mikel Arteta . Fulham made a poor start to the 2013\u201314 season which saw manager Martin Jol sacked in December 2013 to be replaced by Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen . Sidwells own performances improved drastically under Meulensteen , scoring five of his eight goals that season during Meulensteens tenure . Following the dropping of Brede Hangeland and Scott Parker , and the transfer of Dimitar Berbatov , Sidwell was promoted to the role of captain in February 2014 . However , two games later , Meulensteen was sacked and Felix Magath was placed in charge . Hangeland was reinstated to the team , and as a result , Sidwell lost the captaincy . There was no change in Fulhams fortunes , and after a 4\u20131 defeat away at Stoke City on 3 May 2014 their relegation to the Championship was confirmed . Following Fulhams relegation , Sidwell criticised his teams performance . On 23 May 2014 Sidwell was released by Fulham .",
      "Stoke City .",
      "On 9 June 2014 Sidwell joined Stoke City on a two-year contract . Upon signing for Stoke , Sidwell stated \u2013 There were two factors behind my decision to join Stoke \u2013 the first being the fact that its a club that is really moving forward . I was really impressed with the football Stoke played last season ; the way they played against Fulham on the penultimate weekend of the season really had a wow factor about it and it led to a first ever top 10 finish in the Premier League . Then theres the manager ( Mark Hughes ) because hes a man that I have the highest regard for . He signed me for Fulham and I really enjoyed the time I worked with him there . He made his debut for Stoke on 24 August 2014 in a 1\u20131 draw away at Hull City . After making just one start in his first two months with the club Sidwell admitted that competition for places is stronger than he anticipated .

Sidwell played 18 times for the Seagulls scoring once as they finished in 3rd position , losing out to Sheffield Wednesday in the play-offs . Following his release by Stoke , Sidwell signed a one-year contract with Brighton . On 5 November 2016 , Sidwell scored from 50 yards in a 2\u20130 win against Bristol City .

      "La Japonaise ( painting )",
      "The painting was first exhibited in the second Impressionism exhibition of 1876 , and is now exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston .",
      "Description .",
      "In the painting , Monet depicts Camille in a padded , heavily decorated red kimono ( an ) belonging to a famous Japanese actor , standing on Japanese-style tatami mat and in front of a wall decorated by Japanese fans . Camille , whose hair was dark , wears a blonde wig , emphasizing her identity as a European woman , indicating that the painting shows the performance and appropriation of Japanese culture rather than an authentic Japanese environment .",
      "Camilles body , turned in profile , shows her face turned towards the viewer , a gesture likely inspired by gestures found in traditional Japanese dance ; illustrations depicting Japanese dance , such as Charles Wirgmans A Japanese dinner party , were popular in Europe at the time , and would likely have been available for Monet to draw inspiration from .",
      "Monet places particular importance in the depiction of the detailed samurai embroidery on Camilles robe , positioning the face of the samurai in the near centre of the canvas . The depiction of the samurai , with dark hair , a stern facial expression and a strong grip on the sword in his belt , contrast Camille - with blonde hair , holding a fan delicately and smiling - strongly , drawing attention again to the difference between the Japanese setting and the European woman within it . Camilles raised right hand holds a folding fan in the colours of the French flag , which also appeared in one of Renoirs paintings .",
      "The contrast between Camille and the paintings faux-cultural setting is increased further by a backdrop of fans . Though most depict only hazy Impresssionist landscapes , with one on the left showing a red-crowned crane , a fan to the right of Camilles raised right hand shows a Japanese woman wearing a kimono and a traditional hairstyle , depicted on a rosy red background . Separated from the others with a contrasting background , it draws attention as the womans face tilts in the opposite direction to Camilles , echoing the other . While Camille looks out at the viewer with a smile , the woman in the fan shows an almost astonished facial expression looking at her European counterpart .",
      "Motivation .",
      "Money became one of Monets biggest troubles in the 1860s . His father had cut his allowance due to Monets rebellious decision to create works unsuitable for the state-sponsored Salon exhibitions . Although Monets financial condition improved in the early 1870s after his works were recognized and regularly purchased by art dealer , this support began to erode due to s difficulty in selling them ; due to the loss of this important source of income and the expenses Monet faced in moving into a new house , beginning in 1874 , he began to fall back into financial difficulty .",
      "In desperate need of money , Monet created this painting of his wife in a red kimono that he borrowed from a friend , and sent the painting to s gallery in the second Impressionism exhibition of 1876 , along with 18 other paintings , including the famous Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son . Given the popularity of Japonisme in France at this time , Monet hoped to sell at a high price to ease his financial difficulties .",
      "Forty years later , in 1918 , when the art dealers and visited Monet and informed him that had sold for a very decent price , Monet was said to stated that he was ashamed by the fact of having painted the work simply to please the market , calling it a piece of filth . Some scholars believe that he may have been more committed to this subject than these comments would suggest ; when the work was in progress , Monet wrote to Philippe Burty , a famous art critic and collector of Japanese artworks , commenting that it was superb to paint the heavily detailed kimono . Other scholars argue that this letter may have been an advertisement instead of Monets true words , and motivated by a desire to influence notable critics who held an interest in such as Burty .",
      "Another possible motivation for the creation of this painting is that Monet wished to compete with his friend s work The Lady with the Fans , modeled by in 1873 . There is no solid evidence that Monet had seen this work in person before he painted the , but he seemed to know of it from an engraving of s sketch of the work , published in the book in February 1874 . A 1876 review in the journal even described Monets works as following suit .",
      "Criticism .",
      "After being exhibited in the second Impressionism exhibition in 1876 , the painting received attention , though not always positive , from art critics . Critics and praised the work for its innovation and bold use of colors , but many critics described the work as bizarre and sexually suggestive . The critic wrote in his review : He has shown a Chinese in a red robe with two heads , one is that of a demi-mondaine placed on the shoulders , the other that of a monster , placed we dare not say where . Other writers pointed out the placement of the samurais head on the robe as being suggestive , coupled with the depiction of unshesthing his sword . Camilles coquettish facial expression was also said to be part of the erotic symbolism .",
      "The criticism seemed to embarrass Monet , who likely withdrew the work from the exhibition before its end to prevent public viewing , though he claimed the work had been purchased by a secret buyer at the unbelievably high price of 2,020 francs . Many art historians have questioned the authenticity of this record-breaking price , with a variety of different explanations . Some believe that it was a publicity stunt played by Monet and ; that bought it at a high price and Monet secretly repurchased it back . Another art historian believes that the purchase was a face-saving fable to move the public attention away from the embarrassing criticism . The hypothesis that the unprecedentedly high price was not real offers an explanation for the content in a letter from Monet to his friend , in which the painting was mentioned . Monet wrote:I would be very obliged to you if you would not repeat to anyone what I told you on the subject of . I have promised to keep it quiet , it would inconvenience me . I count , then , on your discretion and , in case you may already have dropped a word to , recommend to him the most complete silence , otherwise , there would be endless gossip and annoyances for me .",
      "It is possible that Monet had informed of his trick , and that he had warned him not to tell anyone else , or that Monet wanted to hide from the public the painting Camille had modeled for , given the criticism of the paintings sexually suggestive nature , though no one mentioned Camilles name in connection with the work until Monet revealed her role to and in 1918 , the blond wig having disguised her identity until this point .",
      "Kimono Wednesday controversy .",
      "In 2015 , the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston held a special program called Kimono Wednesdays in which visitors were invited to pose in front of while wearing a replica of the kimono in the painting . The kimono , made in Kyoto , was offered by NHK , the Japanese cosponsor of the initiative . The kimono was first exhibited in several Japanese cities , and visitors to the exhibition were invited to pose for photos wearing the kimono .",
      "The MFA brought the kimono to Boston and continued the activities that had taken place in Japan . The event drew criticism from protesters , who described the program as an example of Orientalism and white supremacy , accusing the museum of having insufficiently [ grappled ] with [ the painting\u2019s ] post-colonial legacy . As part of the protest , a Tumblr blog titled Decolonize Our Museums criticized the Kimono Wednesday event as a form of cultural appropriation , and described it as enacted by a historically white institution that retains the power to represent\u2014and therefore dominate\u2014other ethnic and cultural groups .",
      "Although the museum stopped allowing visitors to wear the kimono in response to the criticisms , the program was defended by some , with Japans deputy consul general telling the press that the protest did not make sense from a Japanese perspective . Japanese counter-protesters led by Timothy visited the exhibition wearing their own kimono after the MFA stopped allowing visitors to pose wearing the replica , arguing that kimono could be enjoyed by people of all ethnicities , not only the Japanese . Meiji University professor Shaun O\u2019Dwyer also defended the program , citing his concern of the shrinking nature of the traditional kimono making industry , and the need of any possible publicity for its survival .",
      "Monet chose the subject of partially for its popularity in the Parisian art market in the 1870s , with his later works reflecting a deeper level of understanding and application of Japanese aesthetics , compared to the comparatively surface-level depiction shown in .",

Diop was elected to the National Assembly in the 1983 , 1988 , 1993 , and 1998 elections as a PS candidate ; he also became Mayor of Rufisque in 1987 and was Vice-President of the Association of Mayors of Senegal from 1988 to 2002 . Additionally , he held the posts of Secretary-General of the PS Regional Union in Dakar and First Vice-President of the Urban Community of Dakar from 1990 to 2000 . In the National Assembly , Diop was President of the Laws and Human Rights Commission from 1996 to 2000 and President of the Defense and Security Commission from 2000 to 2001 .",
      "Party split .",
      "Shortly before the first round of the 2000 presidential election , violence broke out between supporters of the PS and the opposition in Rufisque on 23 February 2000 ; there were six injuries , and two homes owned by Diop were set on fire . He described it as a grave sign for democracy in Senegal . After the first round , Diop resigned from the PS on 2 March 2000 , choosing to support opposition candidate Abdoulaye Wade against the incumbent president and PS candidate Abdou Diouf and joining a pro-Wade alliance , the Front for the Alternance . According to Diop , his defection dealt a severe political , electoral and psychological blow to the PS and its candidate , Abdou Diouf , who was defeated by Wade in the second round . He then founded a new party , the PPC , on 30 May 2000 , becoming its Secretary-General . Subsequently , he was elected to the National Assembly as a PPC candidate through national list proportional representation in the April 2001 parliamentary election ; he was the only PPC candidate to win a seat .",
      "The PPC merged itself into Wades party , the PDS , on 20 May 2002 ; Diop became National Political Secretary of the PDS at that time . Also in 2002 , Diop left his position as Mayor of Rufisque , becoming Honorary Mayor instead . He joined the National Political Administration of the PDS in May 2003 and joined the PDS Steering Committee in May 2004 . Wade then appointed Diop as President of the CRAES when that body was created in August 2004 . Diop also became President of the Union of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions of La Francophonie in June 2007 . On 1 October 2007 , Wade asked Diop to resign from his position as President of the CRAES , while stressing that he did not have a dispute with Diop and did not want to start one . Diop was unwilling to resign , however , saying that he had done nothing wrong and that people would not understand if he left his post prior to the end of his five-year term in August 2009 . On 4 October , when Diop was preparing to travel to a meeting of the Union of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions of La Francophonie , Wade barred him from leaving the country . After Iba Der Thiam mediated the situation , Diop agreed to resign on 16 November , but Wade nevertheless criticized Diop at a meeting of the PDS Steering Committee , saying that he had wasted 300 million CFA francs on whimisical missions . Wade dissolved the CRAES on 21 November 2007 and established a new Economic and Social Council in its place .",
      "On 13 February 2008 , the Grand Marabout of the Mourides , Serigne Mouhamadou Lamine Bara Mback\u00e9 , asked Diop to return from Paris to meet with Wade in Dakar on 14 February . Wade and Diop accordingly met at the presidential palace and discussed the reasons for Wades dissolution of the CRAES . On this occasion , Wade complained that Diop had failed to campaign for him in the February 2007 presidential election , while Diop said that he had created a slogan supporting Wades candidacy and that he had toured the regional capitals to speak in support of Wades candidacy . Wade also said that he had heard that Diop had boasted that Wade could not act against him ; Diop replied that he could not simultaneously support Wades re-election and defy his authority . Wade told Diop that he no longer had any complaint against him , especially as my marabout asks it of me . Diop subsequently went to Touba to thank the Grand Marabout for his intervention on 16 February .",
      "Diop said on 16 September 2009 that he did not favor moves to eliminate the two-round system for presidential elections , arguing that it would be less democratic to decide the outcome in a single round . He nevertheless expressed his firm support for President Wades planned 2012 re-election bid ."

      "The Great Eastern Railway ( GER ) Class S69 , also known as 1500 Class , and later classified B12 by the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) is a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotive designed to haul express passenger trains from London Liverpool Street station along the Great Eastern Main Line . Originally they were designed by S . D . Holden , but were much rebuilt , resulting in several subclasses .",
      "Seventy-one S69 locomotives were built between 1911 and 1921 and numbered 1500\u20131570 . Fifty-one of these were built at the GERs Stratford Works and the remaining 20 by William Beardmore and Company . A further 10 locomotives were built by Beyer , Peacock and Company for the LNER in 1928 and numbered 8571\u20138580 . From 1948 the British Railways numbers were 61500\u201361580 ( with gaps ) .",
      "Background .",
      "At the time of their introduction , the Claud Hamilton 4-4-0s were becoming outclassed on the heaviest express . Although an enlarged 4-4-0 design was mooted , it was realised that any such design would have too high an axle load for the tracks of the Great Eastern Railway , which had a relatively low restriction . Another design constraint was the short turntables used at the time . This meant that a 4-6-0 design was decided upon , although the design was relatively short compared to similar designs introduced at the same time .",
      "LNER .",
      "Seventy were still in service at the 1923 grouping , the LNER adding 7000 to the numbers of nearly all the ex-Great Eastern locomotives , including the Class S69 locomotives . A further ten were ordered in 1928 to ease a power shortage caused by the stalled development on a new class of 4-6-0 locomotives , and the cancellation of the planned suburban 2-6-4T tank locomotive due to the adverse press publicity caused by the Sevenoaks derailment .",
      "All the B12 locomotives were fitted with vacuum ejectors between 1924 and 1929 ( the 1928 batch had them from new ) . Fifty-five locomotives were fitted with ACFI feedwater heaters between 1927 and 1934 , but these were removed between 1934 and 1942 . The first substantive change was the fitting of Lenz poppet valves to the 1928 batch ( from new ) , and six of the ex-GE locomotives ( 8516/19/25/32/33/40 ) . These locomotives were then classified as class B12/2 . The poppet valves were not a great success and they all reverted to or were converted to piston valve engines between 1931 and 1934 .",
      "As newer power became available , the locomotives\u2019 low axleload made them ideal candidates for transfers elsewhere . consequently , between 1931 and 1942 , twenty-five locomotives were transferred to Scotland for use on the former Great North of Scotland Railway lines .",
      "Starting in 1932 , a programme began of rebuilding the B12 locomotives with larger diameter boilers . The Diagram 99A boilers utilised were diameter , compared with the diameter originals . These rebuilt locomotives were classified as class B12/3 , and as they had a higher axleload , none of the Scottish-allocated locomotives were included . The last to be rebuilt was 8549 in 1944 , leaving 8534 as the last English B12/1 ; but it was withdrawn the following year without being rebuilt .",
      "As the Scottish locomotives also required new boilers , a new design was started in 1941 , based on the old design but with a round-topped firebox and other detail changes . Thirty of these Diagram 25A boilers were manufactured at Doncaster and Stratford between 1942 and 1946 . Nine were sent to Inverurie Works for fitting to B12 locomotives , the remainder went to Stratford for fitting to class J20 locomotives . The B12 locomotives fitted with the Diagram 25A boiler ( 1500/04/05/07/08/11/24/26 ) were classified as class B12/4 .",
      "In the 1942 LNER renumbering scheme , the class was allocated the range 7415\u20137494 , but only eleven ( 7426/37/49/67/70/72/76/79/82/88/91 ) were renumbered before the scheme was abandoned due to the war . In the 1946 scheme , the class was allocated the 1500\u20131580 block , with gaps for the two withdrawn locomotives .",
      "British Railways .",
      "At nationalisation in 1948 , seventy-two locomotives passed to British Railways , who renumbered them 61500\u201361580 . Withdrawals continued , and all were gone by the end of 1961 . One engine , LNER No . 8572 , has been preserved .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "- On 12 July 1913 , locomotive No . 1506 was hauling an express passenger train which collided with a light engine at , Essex due to a signalmans error . Three people were killed and fourteen were injured . The brand new locomotive was so severely damaged that only its boiler and tender were salvaged .",
      "- On 17 January 1931 , locomotive No . 8578 was hauling a newspaper train that departed from station , Essex against signals . It was in collision with a light engine at Great Holland . Two people were killed and two were seriously injured .",

      "Lucy Wills",
      "Lucy Wills , LRCP ( 10 May 1888 \u2013 26 April 1964 ) was an English haematologist and physician researcher . She conducted research in India in the late 1920s and early 1930s on macrocytic anaemia of pregnancy , a disease which is characterized by enlarged red blood cells and is life-threatening .",
      "Pregnant women in the tropics with inadequate diets are particularly susceptible . Wills discovered a nutritional factor in yeast that both prevents and cures this disorder . This component , the so-called Wills Factor , was subsequently shown to be folate , the naturally occurring form of folic acid .",
      "Early life .",
      "Generations of the Wills family had been living in or near Birmingham , a city known as the workshop of the world for its many factories and industry . Lucy Wills was born on 10 May 1888 in nearby Sutton Coldfield . Her paternal great-grandfather , William Wills , had been a prosperous attorney from a Nonconformist Unitarian family ( see Church of the Messiah , Birmingham ) . One of his sons , Alfred Wills , followed him into the law and became notable both as a judge and a mountaineer . Another son , Lucys grandfather , bought an edge-tool business in Nechells , AW Wills & Son , which manufactured such implements as scythes and sickles . Lucys father continued to manage the business and the family was comfortably well off .",
      "Lucy Willss father , William Leonard Wills ( 1858\u20131911 ) , was a science graduate of Owens College ( later part of the Victoria University of Manchester , now part of the University of Manchester ) . Her mother , Gertrude Annie Wills n\u00e9e Johnston ( 1855\u20131939 ) , was the only daughter ( with six brothers ) of a well-known Birmingham doctor , James Johnston . The family had a strong interest in scientific matters . William Wills , the lawyer mentioned above , had been involved with the British Association for the Advancement of Science and wrote papers on meteorology and other scientific observations . Her father was particularly interested in botany , zoology , geology , and natural sciences generally , as well as in the developing science of photography . Her brother , Leonard Johnston Wills , carried this interest in geology and natural sciences into his own career with great success .",
      "Lucy Wills was brought up in the country near Birmingham , initially in Sutton Coldfield , and then from 1892 in Barnt Green to the south of the city . She went at first to a local school called Tanglewood , kept by a Miss Ashe , formerly a governess to the Chamberlain family of Birmingham .",
      "Education .",
      "English girls had few opportunities for education and entry into the professions until towards the end of the nineteenth century . Wills was able to attend Cheltenham Ladies College , Newnham College Cambridge , and the London School of Medicine for Women .",
      "In September 1903 Wills went to Cheltenham , one of the first British boarding schools to train female students in science and mathematics . Willss elder sister Edith was in the same house , Glenlee , two years ahead of her . Willss examination record was good . She passed the Oxford Local Senior , Division I in 1905 ; the University of London , Matriculation , Division II in 1906 ; and Part I , Class III and Paley , exempt from Part II and additional subjects by matriculation ( London ) .",
      "In September 1907 , Wills began her studies at Newnham , a womens college . Wills was strongly influenced by the botanist Albert Charles Seward and by the geologist Herbert Henry Thomas , who worked on carboniferous palaeobotany . Wills finished her course in 1911 and obtained a Class 2 in Part 1 of the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1910 and Class 2 in Part 2 ( Botany ) in 1911 . While she was allowed to sit the University examinations , she was ineligible as a woman to receive a Cambridge degree .",
      "1911 to 1914 .",
      "In February 1911 , Willss father died at the age of 53 . She had been very close to him , and it is likely that his unexpected death affected her final exam results that summer . In 1913 , her elder sister Edith died at the age of 26 . Later that year , Wills and her mother travelled to Ceylon , now Sri Lanka , where they visited relatives and friends . In 1914 , she and her younger brother Gordon travelled to South Africa . A friend from Newnham , Margaret ( Margot ) Hume , was lecturing in botany at the South African College , then part of the University of the Cape of Good Hope . She and Wills were both interested in Sigmund Freuds theories . At the outbreak of war in August 1914 , Gordon enlisted in the Transvaal Scottish Regiment . Wills spent some weeks doing voluntary nursing in a hospital in Cape Town , before she and Margot Hume returned to England , arriving in Plymouth in December .",
      "Medical training .",
      "In January 1915 , Wills enrolled at the London ( Royal Free Hospital ) School of Medicine for Women , the first school in Britain to train female doctors . The school had strong links with India , and had a number of students from there , including Jerusha Jhirad , who became the first Indian woman to qualify with a degree in obstetrics and gynecology in 1919 .",
      "Wills became a legally qualified medical practitioner with the qualification of Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians London awarded in May 1920 ( LRCP Lond 1920 ) , and the University of London degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery awarded in December 1920 ( MB BS Lond ) , at age 32 .",
      "Professional career .",
      "1920 to 1928 .",
      "On qualifying , Wills decided to research and teach in the department of Pregnant Pathology at the Royal Free . There she worked with Christine Pillman ( who later married Ulysses S . Grant OBE , a doctor on its teaching staff ) who had been at Girton at the same time Wills was at Newnham , on metabolic studies of pregnancy .",
      "To India .",
      "In 1928 Wills began her seminal research work in India on macrocytic anaemia in pregnancy , a condition where the red blood cells are larger than normal . This was prevalent in a severe form among poorer women with dietary deficiencies , particularly those in the textile industry . Dr Margaret Balfour of the Indian Medical Service had asked her to join the Maternal Mortality Inquiry by the Indian Research Fund Association at the Haffkine Institute in Bombay , now Mumbai .",
      "Wills was in India between 1928 and 1933 , mostly based at the Haffkine . From April to October 1929 , she moved her work to the Pasteur Institute of India in Coonoor ( where Sir Robert McCarrison was Director of Nutrition Research ) . In early 1931 she was working at the Caste and Gosha Hospital in Madras , now the Government Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women and Children of Chennai ( see Gosha woman ) . In each of the summers of 1930\u201332 she returned to England for a few months and continued her work in the pathology laboratories at the Royal Free . She was back at the Royal Free full-time in 1933 , but there was another 10-week working visit to the Haffkine Institute from November 1937 to early January 1938 . On this occasion , and for the first time , Wills travelled by air to Karachi and onward by sea .",
      "She travelled to India in October 1937 by air , a five-day journey on Imperial Airwayss recently inaugurated route carrying mail and some passengers . The aircraft was a Short C Class Empire flying boat , the Calypso , G AEUA . The route started at Southampton and involved landings on water for refuelling at Marseilles , Bracciano near Rome , Brindisi , Athens , Alexandria , Tiberias , Habbaniyah to the west of Baghdad , Basra , Bahrain , Dubai , Gwadar and Karachi , with overnight stops at Rome , Alexandria , Basra and Sharjah ( just outside Dubai ) . This was the first IA flight to go beyond Alexandria .",
      "In Bombay Wills was on dining terms with the governors and their wives at Government House \u2013 Sir Leslie Wilson in 1928 and Sir Frederick Sykes in 1929 . In 1929 she visited Mysuru and wrote to her brother that I was most fortunate to be under the wing of Sir Charles Todhunter , who is a very important person there . Todhunter had been Governor of Madras and in 1929 was the secretary to the Maharaja of Mysuru .",
      "Anaemia of pregnancy .",
      "Wills observed a correlation between the dietary habits of different classes of Bombay women and the likelihood of their becoming anaemic during pregnancy . Poor Muslim women were the ones with both the most deficient diets and the greatest susceptibility to anaemia .",
      "This anaemia was then known as pernicious anaemia of pregnancy . However , Wills was able to demonstrate that the anaemia she observed differed from true pernicious anaemia , as the patients did not have achlorhydria , an inability to produce gastric acid . Furthermore , while patients responded to crude liver extracts , they did not respond to the pure liver extracts ( vitamin B ) which had been shown to treat true pernicious anaemia . She postulated that there must have been another nutritional factor responsible for this macrocytic anaemia other than vitamin B deficiency . For some years this nutritional factor was known as the Wills Factor , and it was later shown , in the 1940s , to be folate , of which the synthetic form is folic acid .",
      "Wills decided to investigate possible nutritional treatments by first studying the effects of dietary manipulation on a macrocytic anaemia in albino rats . This work was done at the Nutritional Research Laboratories at the Pasteur Institute of India in Coonoor . Rats fed on the same diet as Bombay Muslim women became anaemic , pregnant ones dying before giving birth . The rat anaemia was prevented by the addition of yeast to synthetic diets which had no vitamin B . This work was later duplicated using rhesus monkeys as the rat results were tainted by a lice infection which may have skewed those results .",
      "Back in Bombay , Wills conducted clinical trials on patients with macrocytic anaemia and established experimentally that this type could be both prevented and cured by yeast extracts , of which the cheapest source was Marmite .",
      "After India .",
      "Wills was back again at the Royal Free Hospital in London from 1938 until her retirement in 1947 . During the Second World War she was a full-time pathologist in the Emergency Medical Service . Work in the pathology department was disrupted for a few days in July 1944 ( and a number of people were killed ) when the hospital suffered a direct hit from a V1 flying bomb . By the end of the war , she was in charge of pathology at the Royal Free Hospital and had established the first haematology department there .",
      "After her retirement , Wills travelled extensively , including to Jamaica , Fiji and South Africa , continuing her observations on nutrition and anaemia . In Fiji she , along with New Zealander Dr . Muriel Bell , was responsible for carrying out the first multi-ethnic nutritional survey of women and children in Fiji ( 1950 ) . They studied the source of anaemias , protein and vitamin deficiencies there . Their work was based on some flawed assumptions about the causes of these issues , while at the same time their recommendations were responsible for the introduction of free iron tablets for anaemic pregnant women and attempts to provide infants and children with increased protein intake through feeding programmes at schools and health centers .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Wills never married . She was close to her parents , her siblings , and their children . She enjoyed a number of close lifelong friendships , including with Christine and Ulysses Williams , with her Cambridge contemporary Margot Hume ( with whom she jointly owned a cottage in Surrey whose botanical garden they cultivated ) , and with Kait Lucan ( the Dowager Countess of Lucan , mother of John Bingham , 7th Earl of Lucan , the disappearing earl ) , who was a fellow Labour Councillor in Chelsea .",
      "Obituaries and other publications describe her as independent , autocratic , not a sufferer of fools , a joyous and enthusiastic teacher , an indomitable walker and skier , an enthusiastic traveller , a lover of the beauty of nature , mirthful and entertaining .",
      "Wills died on 26 April 1964 . Her obituary in the British Medical Journal the following month included the following comments :",
      "Publications .",
      "Willss first learned paper was in 1914 , on plant cuticles . There were a further two papers in the 1920s before she started her work in India . Four reports of her field and laboratory studies in India were published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 1930 and 1931 . After her return to England , there were a number of further papers concerning her work on tropical macrocytic anaemia .",

      "Jim Prentice",
      "Peter Eric James Prentice ( July 20 , 1956 \u2013 October 13 , 2016 ) was a Canadian politician who served as the 16th Premier of Alberta from 2014 to 2015 . In the 2004 federal election he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada . He was re-elected in the 2006 federal election and appointed to the cabinet as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for M\u00e9tis and Non-Status Indians . Prentice was appointed Minister of Industry on August 14 , 2007 , and after the 2008 election became Minister of Environment on October 30 , 2008 . On November 4 , 2010 , Prentice announced his resignation from cabinet and as MP for Calgary Centre-North . After retiring from federal politics he entered the private sector as vice-chairman of CIBC .",
      "Prentice entered provincial politics in his home province of Alberta , and ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta to replace Dave Hancock , who was serving as interim Premier and party leader after Alison Redfords resignation . On September 6 , 2014 , Prentice won the leadership election , becoming both the leader of the Progressive Conservatives and as such the Premier , as his party held a majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta .",
      "As Premier of Alberta , Prentice formed a new cabinet consisting of some members from the previous government , but also new Ministers including two who did not hold seats in the Legislature\u2014Stephen Mandel and Gordon Dirks . All three stood as candidates in by-elections scheduled for October 27 , 2014 , and all three were elected with Prentice becoming the MLA for Calgary-Foothills . After introducing his first budget in 2015 , Prentice declared an early provincial election on May 5 , 2015 . In the election , Prentices PCs suffered an unprecedented defeat , dropping to third place in the legislature with just 10 seats \u2013 ending 44 years of Tory rule in Alberta , the longest consecutive reign for any political party at the provincial level in Canada . Despite winning re-election in Calgary-Foothills , on election night Prentice resigned as both PC leader and MLA and retired from politics after results indicated that the Alberta NDP had won a majority government .",
      "On October 13 , 2016 , Prentice and three others were killed when the aircraft in which they were travelling crashed shortly after taking off from Kelowna , British Columbia . The flight was en route from Kelowna to Springbank Airport , just outside Calgary .",
      "Background .",
      "Prentice was born to a large , blue-collar family in South Porcupine , near Timmins , Ontario . The family then moved to Alberta in 1969 . He was the son of Wilma Lyle Marea ( Mawhiney ) and Eric Prentice , a professional hockey player who played five games in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) in the 1940s . His uncle Dean Prentice played in the NHL for more than 20 years . Prentice was educated at the University of Alberta ( where he became a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity ) and Dalhousie University . He paid for his tuition by working as a coal miner in the summer months for seven years .",
      "As a lawyer , he served as a Law Commissioner of the Indian Claims Commission of Canada .",
      "In his personal life , Prentice served for seven years on the Board of Directors at the Calgary Winter Club , including stints as president and Chairman . He was an active member and volunteer leader in the Grace Presbyterian Church . Prentice and his wife Karen have three daughters and two grandchildren .",
      "He was also a member of the Trilateral Commission , a non-partisan organization that aims to increase cooperation within the developed world . In this capacity , Prentice was one of 20 Canadian members .",
      "Early political career .",
      "Prentice joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1976 , and was active in Tory circles ever since . In the 1986 provincial election , Prentice ran for the Progressive Conservatives in Calgary Mountain View , being defeated by NDP candidate Bob Hawkesworth .",
      "During the early 1990s , Prentice served as the governing federal PC partys chief financial officer and treasurer ( 1990\u201393 ) . Prentice first ran for Parliament as the nominated Progressive Conservative candidate in a spring 2002 by-election in the riding of Calgary Southwest that followed the retirement of Preston Manning as the ridings Member of Parliament ( MP ) . When newly elected Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper replaced nominated CA candidate Ezra Levant in the by-election , Prentice withdrew from the race , following common practice to allow a party leader to win a seat uncontested so they may lead their party within Parliament .",
      "He ran in the 2003 Progressive Conservative leadership election to support the United Alternative proposal to merge the PC party with the Canadian Alliance . He was seen by many as an alternative to the status quo candidate and front runner Peter MacKay . A basic platform of Prentices campaign was that no one has ever defeated the Liberals with a divided conservative family . Prentice entered the 2003 convention day with some momentum , after delivering a passionate speech to the assembled delegates that encouraged Tories to be proud of their accomplishments , despite recent setbacks , and that recalled the sacrifices of Canadian soldiers who fought in the Battle of Passchendaele . He also unexpectedly received the support of fellow leadership challenger Craig Chandler , who withdrew early . Prentice ultimately emerged in second-place on the fourth ballot to the eventual winner MacKay . Consistent with his positions during the leadership race , Prentice was a supporter of the merger endorsed by both the CA and PC parties in December 2003 that formed the new Conservative Party of Canada .",
      "Prentice was the first declared candidate for the leadership of the new Conservative Party , announcing his run on December 7 , 2003 , the day after the new party was ratified by members of the PC Party . Prentice began his campaign in Calgary and toured parts of Ontario , specifically visiting Kingston , Ontario , the hometown of the first Canadian Conservative Leader Sir John A . Macdonald and also the city where one of his daughters attends Queens University . However , he withdrew from the race on January 12 , 2004 , citing difficulty in raising new funds less than a year after his unsuccessful first leadership bid . The leadership election was won by Stephen Harper , who later became Prime Minister of Canada after the 2006 Canadian federal election .",
      "Early parliamentary career .",
      "Prentice ran in the riding of Calgary Centre-North in the 2004 election for the new Conservative Party , and won the seat with 54% of the popular vote .",
      "After being sworn in as the MP for Calgary Centre North on July 16 , Conservative Party Leader Stephen Harper named Prentice to the Shadow Cabinet as the Official Opposition Critic for Indian and Northern Affairs . In that role Prentice opposed the Tli Cho land claim agreement , which he said would make Canadian law secondary to Tlicho local law . Prentice was also a strong supporter of the proposed and controversial Mackenzie Valley pipeline . He criticized the Liberal government for its treatment of aboriginal women , and its alleged costs of administering the Residential School Claims program for aboriginal victims of abuse .",
      "Prentice described himself as a Red Tory in the Conservative Party and surprised many observers when he voted in favour of Bill C-38 supporting same-sex marriage .",
      "Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development .",
      "Prentice had been assigned the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development in the Conservative government , and was sworn into this role on February 6 , 2006 until August 13 , 2007 . One of his main challenges as Minister was to implement The Nunavut Project , a 2006 report authored by Thomas Berger , to show tangible , measurable results to increase Inuit representation in the Nunavut public services .",
      "Kelowna Accord and residential schools .",
      "In the fall of 2006 , Phil Fontaine , National chief of the Assembly of First Nations , expressed disappointment over the Conservative governments refusal to honour the Kelowna Accord , endorsed by 14 jurisdictions ( the federal government , 10 provinces , and three territories ) . Fontaine previously described the federal governments point person on Kelowna , Jim Prentice , as an honourable person sensitive to native concerns . Prior to January 2006 election , Fontaine and two vice-chiefs of the Assembly of First Nations had a meeting with Prentice . [ Prentice ] acknowledged all the hard work that went into Kelowna and ( said ) that the Conservative party would not put this aside , says Fontaine . We took him at his word . Prentice did not recall saying that : Ive always been very , very careful about what Ive said about Kelowna , According to Fontaine , in their first meeting after the 2006 election , ( Prentice ) wanted to apply a very focused approach to his responsibilities . In the federal budget of May 2006 , Fontaine and other native leaders got a glimpse of what focused meant : just $450 million ( over two years ) was committed to implementing Kelowna , not the $1.64 billion for the first two years that Paul Martin had agreed to .",
      "Prentice argued that there was actually $3.7 billion in spending on native peoples in the May 2006 budget , more than the previous four budgets in total . That figure includes $2.2 billion in compensation for victims of abuse in residential schools ( another deal that was worked out with the previous government ) and $300 million for off-reserve housing .",
      "On June 11 , 2008 Prime Minister Stephen Harper thanked Jim Prentice for his work on addressing the matter of the Indian residential schools and providing a government apology for the residential school system . Stephen Harpers thanks to Prentice came before he made the apology to former students of the schools .",
      "Minister of Industry .",
      "In a cabinet shuffle on August 14 , 2007 , Prentice became Minister of Industry , succeeding Maxime Bernier .",
      "Copyright legislation and controversy .",
      "Bringing Canada into WIPO treaty compliance had been stated as one of Prentices goals in future copyright legislation . It has been pointed out repeatedly , however , that at the time of Prentices statement of his rationale for introducing amendments to the Copyright Act , there was no international legal obligation to implement any provision of the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) Copyright Treaty ( WCT ) or the WIPO Performances & Phonograms Treaty ( WPPT ) since neither had been ratified by Canada . Prentice has promised to put consumers first . claiming in an editorial that ( C-61 ) allows the recording of webcasts and TV and radio programs to be enjoyed at different times while ignoring the fact that if the files are protected by digital rights management ( DRM ) it is illegal to break the DRM to make the recording . Michael Geist , Canada Research Chair of Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa , has suggested that the core desire of the draft legislation is to satisfy U.S . pressure by enacting something very close to the U.S . Digital Millennium Copyright Act .",
      "Prentice did not immediately provide a rationale for not discussing the issue with CBC Radio Canada despite the hundreds of questions that flooded in from concerned Canadians . He also refused to talk to a group of protesters who went to his office to express their concern , stating When Canadian Heritage Minister Jos\u00e9e Verner and I have reached a consensus and were satisfied , we will introduce a bill . Prentice has also implied that he will not follow the Governments policy to table the WCT & WPPT 21 days prior to introducing copyright amendments designed to implement parts of these treaties contrary to the Governments policy on treaty implementation . Industry Canada announced on June 11 , 2008 , that Prentice will deliver brief statements and answer media inquiries shortly after the tabling of a bill to amend the Copyright Act .. . [ on ] Thursday , June 12 , 2008 . After less than two hours , hundreds of Canadians and critics panned the new Bill C-61 as nothing more than pandering to US interests at the expense of Canadians .",
      "On a 10-minute interview with the CBCs Search Engine radio program he dismissed any question related to digital rights management as extremely technical and claimed that the market will take care of copy protected CDs . Prentice then hung up mid question and refused to continue the interview at a later time . Most notably , Jim Prentice hung up before answering Jesse Browns final question about who , under this bill , would have the power to investigate potential copyright violations .",
      "Wikipedia controversy .",
      "During the period of May 27 , 2008 to June 4 , 2008 , edits originating from an IP address belonging to Industry Canada were made to the Jim Prentice article on Wikipedia . The edits included the removal of references to new copyright legislation ( claiming that it did not exist ) and the addition of two passages about Prentices recent accomplishments as Minister of Industry . Specifically , information about the copyright controversy was deleted from Prentices biography by someone using an Industry Canada IP address .",
      "Jay Walsh , spokesman for the Wikimedia Foundation , said in an interview there are tens of thousands of living people with biographies on Wikipedia , so challenges about information are not uncommon . Walsh said neutrality of language and guarding against conflicts of interest are two of the central pillars of Wikipedia . He said , The edits which should be trusted would come from people who dont possess a conflict of interest , in this case , it would be worthwhile saying that if someone is making edits from a computer within the government of Canada \u2026 if it was someone within that ministry , that would theoretically constitute a conflict of interest .",
      "Auto industry .",
      "In a February 29 , 2008 speech to the Toronto Board of Trade Prentice rejected the concept of direct subsidies to the auto industry , insisting that setting up a strong economic foundation is a better route to strengthen the business . Former Liberal Leader St\u00e9phane Dion said Finance Minister Jim Flaherty should be fired after the planned shutdown of the GM truck plant in Oshawa , Ont. , with Prentice and Flaherty expressing hope for a new GM plant .",
      "Net neutrality .",
      "While serving as a Federal Cabinet minister , Prentice received criticism that he was sidestepping the issue of Canadas net neutrality laws by not providing clear answers regarding the governments position on internet throttling practices by national Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) . New Democratic Party MP Charlie Angus raised the issue to Prentice in the House of Commons and said the governments hands off approach was bad for Canadian innovation . Prentice said that the issue is being appropriately handled by the Federal government agency the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) , which invited the general public to an open debate on net neutrality .",
      "Text messaging fees .",
      "After initially appearing to take a stand on the issue , Prentice refused to intervene when Telus and Bell started charging 15 cents for incoming SMS text messages despite widespread opposition by consumer groups . This decision was made after Prentice dialogued with senior Bell and Telus executives and suggested that consumers seek alternatives , even in Canadas limited-competition cellular industry .",
      "Minister of the Environment .",
      "On October 30 , 2008 , Prentice was sworn in as Minister of the Environment in the Conservative Government . During his tenure , funding for the CFCAS ( Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences ) was not renewed , which some argued lead to a brain drain in the climate scientific community .",
      "Draft Prentice Movement .",
      "Shortly after the Conservative government faced a possible defeat by the opposition over the Conservatives economic update , a Conservatives for Prentice website emerged , gaining a place on the Blogging Tories blogroll . A posting from a person claiming to be David Higginbottom , Prentices campaign manager in the last election , said , It is unfortunate that at a time when Conservatives need to be working together to prevent what is a desperate power play by the opposition to seize control of our democratically elected government , that a site like this would be created .",
      "Resignation .",
      "On November 4 , 2010 Prentice announced he was resigning as Environment Minister effective immediately and that he would be resigning as Member of Parliament for Calgary Centre-North by the end of the year to take a job as vice-chairman of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce .",
      "Prentice suggested that his departure was for family reasons ; he had committed to spending 10 years in politics , and at that point he had . He expressed a desire to step down so he could explore new opportunities in his life . His resignation raised some questions with the opposition ; NDP leader Jack Layton expressed concern over the apparent connection between Ministers and the large banks .",
      "Premier of Alberta .",
      "Though previously rumoured to have been interested in succeeding Stephen Harper as federal Conservative leader , Prentice entered the 2014 Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership election on May 15 , 2014 . At the time the Alberta PC party was lagging badly in polls behind the opposition Wildrose due to personal expense controversies with Allison Redford , who resigned as premier and party leader after facing a revolt from the caucus and riding associations , with Dave Hancock serving in these roles for the interim . On September 6 , 2014 Prentice won the leadership race with more than 76% of the vote on the first ballot .",
      "Prentice was formally sworn in as premier on September 15 , 2014 . He immediately named a 20-member Executive Council of Alberta , smaller than the cabinet had been under recent premiers . His recommendations for cabinet appointments included two people , former Edmonton mayor Stephen Mandel and former Calgary Board of Education trustee Gordon Dirks , who were not members of the Legislative Assembly . Prentice was elected to the legislature in a by-election in Calgary-Foothills , the seat formerly held by MLA Len Webber . The PCs won all four of the provincial by-elections held on October 27 , 2014 in what was seen at the time as a major electoral success for Prentice .",
      "On November 24 , 2014 , Wildrose Party MLAs Kerry Towle , ( Innisfail-Sylvan Lake ) , and Ian Donovan , ( Little Bow ) crossed the floor to join the ruling PC Partys caucus giving the turmoil within the Wildrose Party , uncertainty about the leadership of Danielle Smith and confidence in Prentice as reasons for their move .",
      "On December 17 , 2014 , in a highly unusual move within any parliament using the Westminster system , Leader of the Opposition Danielle Smith confirmed that she herself and eight other Wildrose members \u2013 Rob Anderson , Gary Bikman , Rod Fox , Jason Hale , Bruce McAllister , Blake Pedersen , Bruce Rowe and Jeff Wilson \u2013 would cross the floor to the Progressive Conservative caucus . At a press conference , Smith said that her conversations with Prentice revealed that they shared so much common ground that it made little sense for her to continue in opposition . If you\u2019re going to be the official Opposition leader , she said , you have to really want to take down the government and really take down the premier . I dont want to take down this premier . I want this premier to succeed . The defections were termed by a journalist as an unprecedented move in Canadian political history , although they did not change the overall make-up of the government \u2013 the Conservatives still held a vast majority of the seats and the Wildrose Party was still the Official Opposition with a smaller caucus in the Legislature .",
      "Prentices March 2015 budget raised a plethora of taxes and fees to help pay the provinces way out of its hole , but he refuses to touch corporate taxes , because he is spooked by the prospect of investors skipping over Alberta for their next billion-dollar energy project , in favour of some more clement petro-state somewhere else . This array of taxes on you and your friends , but not on the C-Suite in Calgary\u2019s office-tower jungle , has provoked populists on the left and right . In retrospect , Ron Kneebone of the University of Calgary\u2019s School of Public Policy defended Prentices budget saying Weve got to look in the mirror . He got tossed for it . But he was absolutely right because he said , You guys keep electing us for spending all this money .",
      "On April 7 , 2015 , Prentice advised the Lieutenant Governor to call an early election for May 5 claiming that he needed to seek a new mandate in order to pass his budget , a full year before he was mandated to by the provincial fixed-election law of an election every four years ( by the constitution , the incumbent government could run for up to five years before the writ had to be dropped in 2017 ) . The Progressive Conservatives were already lagging in polls behind the resurgent Wildrose Party led by Brian Jean , as Prentices pre-election budget was deeply unpopular with both the left and right in the political spectrum while only business leaders thought it was tough but fair . Several gaffes by Prentice hurt him and his party in the campaign , including a comment before the election call in which Prentice appeared to be blaming Albertans , telling them that they had to look in the mirror to understand the root cause of Albertas serious budget shortfall ; Alberta Party leader Greg Clark dubbed this \u201cMr . Prentice\u2019s Alice in Wonderland moment because it\u2019s only in some alternate reality that the blame for decades of PC mismanagement can be placed squarely on Albertans . There was an embarrassing miscalculation in the proposed NDP budget released two days before the debate that Prentice planned to capitalize upon ; during the televised leaders debate Prentice said I know math is difficult to Alberta New Democratic Party leader Rachel Notley in criticizing the multibillion-dollar hole in [ her ] proposed budget , however Prentices remark came under fire for as being deeply patronizing as well as potentially sexist . While Prentice otherwise performed respectably ahead of Wildrose leader Brian Jean and interim Liberal leader David Swann , the NDP gained momentum as a result of the debate and overtook Wildrose for the lead in polls .",
      "The provincial election ended the Progressive Conservatives 44-year run in government , with the Alberta New Democratic Party winning a majority government , the first time the party had been elected to government in the provinces history . The Progressive Conservatives fell to third place in the legislature , with 10 seats , behind both the NDP and the Wildrose Party . While the PCs placed second in terms of the popular vote , their caucus was decimated due to being completely shut out in Edmonton and losing all but eight seats in Calgary . Thirteen members of Prentices cabinet were defeated , though Prentice himself was re-elected in Calgary-Foothills . However , with the overall result beyond doubt , he resigned as PC leader , disclaimed his seat ( thus voiding the election result in his riding ) and retired from politics .",
      "During the transition of power , Prentice advised Premier-designate Notley to continue settlement talks with the Lubicon Lake Band . The band had been seeking an agreement for 80 years , and Prentice had reopened negotiations in the fall of 2014 . Notley recalled He saw a path forward and he advised me how to travel that path , for which I , and many , many others , are very grateful , and the land claim deal was reached in late 2018 .",
      "After politics .",
      "Prentice served as a visiting global fellow at the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington , D.C . for a four-month term that begun in February 2016 . At the Wilson Center , he wrote the book Triple Crown : Winning Canada\u2019s Energy Future with Jean-Sebastien Rioux that was published posthumously by HarperCollins on February 21 , 2017 .",
      "Prentice was appointed as a senior advisor to private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC in June 2016 , specializing in the energy industry .",
      "Death .",
      "Prentice was among the four people killed in a small-plane crash in British Columbia on October 13 , 2016 . He was aboard a twin-engine Cessna Citation 500 that disappeared from radar and crashed in nearby Lake Country shortly after takeoff from Kelowna International Airport , en route to the Springbank Airport , just outside of Calgary . He had spent the day golfing in the Kelowna area and had been returning home to Calgary . In April 2018 , the Transportation Safety Board of Canada reported that while no conclusive reason for the crash could be determined , it was likely that the pilot had experienced spatial disorientation shortly after takeoff , having had little experience flying at night .",
      "A state funeral was held for Prentice on October 28 , 2016 . Numerous dignitaries were in attendance , including former Prime Minister Stephen Harper , interim federal Conservative leader Rona Ambrose , Alberta Premier Rachel Notley , British Columbia Premier Christy Clark , Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi , Green Party Leader Elizabeth May , former prime minister Joe Clark and former opposition leader Preston Manning .",
      "Prentices official portrait as Premier of Alberta was unveiled on February 4 , 2019 . Painted by David Goatley , it depicts Prentice standing on the third floor of the Alberta legislature , hands resting on the marble railing , eyes looking off in the distance . The expression and gaze shows Jims sense of vision . Hes thinking of the future and not the past . At the ceremony of the portrait unveiling , his widow Karen recalled that Prentice was one who couldnt resist meeting with school tours when they passed by his office . He would invite them in , show them around , and give each of them the opportunity to sit in the premiers chair . I honestly believe his hope was that the experience would inspire more than one of these children to become involved in politics one day , and perhaps even become premier ."

      "Svetogorsk",
      "Svetogorsk ( ; ) is an industrial town in Vyborgsky District of Leningrad Oblast , Russia , located on the Karelian Isthmus , on the Vuoksi River . It is located from the Finnish\u2013Russian border , from the Finnish town of Imatra , and from St . Petersburg . Population :",
      "History .",
      "Originally called Enso , the town was founded in 1887 to serve a paper mill . At the time , Enso was part of Viipuri Province and the J\u00e4\u00e4ski Municipality in the Grand Duchy of Finland , which was an autonomic state within the Russian Empire . When Finland became independent in 1917 , Enso remained part of Finland .",
      "The territory was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union by the Moscow Peace Treaty as a result of the Winter War . After the Winter War , the Finns and the Soviets disagreed on the interpretation of the peace treaty regarding Enso . The former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner wrote in his memoirs : Already now a dispute about the district of Enso developed . According to the map attached to the peace treaty Enso was clearly intended to belong to Finland but the Russians claimed that it should belong to them . Later the map was redrawn according to the interests of the Russians so that the border bends at Enso .",
      "In March 1940 , Enso became a part of Yaskinsky District with the administrative center in the work settlement of Yaski . It was a part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic , after March 31 , 1940 of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic .",
      "Enso was recaptured by Finns between 1941 and 1944 during the Continuation War but was again ceded to Soviets by the Moscow Armistice . This secession was formalized after signing the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947 . The Finnish population was resettled to Finland , while migrants from Central Russia resettled the Karelian Isthmus .",
      "On November 24 , 1944 , Yaskinsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish SSR to Leningrad Oblast . On October 1 , 1948 , the district was renamed Lesogorsky and on January 13 , 1949 , all Finnish names of the localities were replaced with Russian names . In particular , Enso was renamed Svetogorsk . On December 9 , 1960 , Lesogorsky District was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District .",
      "In 1972 , the Soviet Union awarded Finland a construction project for a large new cellulose and paper mill in Svetogorsk . The project was paid with Soviet crude oil . The project also gave a start to cross-border relations . Notably , the construction workers in Svetogorsk were called builders , and the project also had intent to build friendship between peoples .",
      "On April 18 , 2008 , about five hundred inhabitants of Svetogorsk participated in a protest which included a road barricade on the Finnish\u2013Russian border as a protest against poor road conditions and lack of investment in road improvement at both federal and municipal level . According to the Finnish public service broadcaster Yle , the militia participated in effectively cutting off through traffic . The main issue of discontent was the lack of a bypass , which , according to reports , should have already been built .",
      "Administrative and municipal status .",
      "Within the framework of administrative divisions , it is , together with the urban-type settlement of Lesogorsky and two rural localities , incorporated within Vyborgsky District as Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation . As a municipal division , Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Vyborgsky Municipal District as Svetogorskoye Urban Settlement .",
      "Economy .",
      "Industry .",
      "Before the Winter War , the town was a major factory site for Enso-Gutzeit Oy , the Finnish pulp and paper company ( now Stora Enso ) . In the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty , the new Finnish-Soviet border was deliberately drawn to leave the factory complex on the Soviet side . The towns major industry is still pulp and paper .",
      "OAO Svetogorsk , one of the biggest paper mills in Russia , is the major employer . Covering , OAO Svetogorsk produces pulp , printing paper , and packaging board . Its brands include Svetocopy and Ballet office paper . Since December 1998 , OAO Svetogorsk has been majority owned by International Paper . At end of 2001 , the plant employed 3,000 people ; by 2008 this had fallen to 2,200 .",
      "Immediately adjacent to OAO Svetogorsk is a tissue mill . This formed part of the original mill complex but was split-away and resold by International Paper to SCA during the acquisition of OAO Svetogorsk from Tetra Laval , which controlled the plant since 1995 . Svetogorsk Tissue , as the separate entity was to be called , became fully integrated into SCA Hygiene Products Division in 2003 ( called Essity since 2017 ) . It employs around four hundred people . Its products include Zewa and Tork brands of paper towels and toilet paper .",
      "Border crossing .",
      "The Imatra\u2013Svetogorsk border crossing plays a key role in the transportation of timber between Russia and Finland . Also , around 150 employees commute daily from Imatra to the paper mills . The border crossing , which had temporary status , was a bottleneck causing frequent delays due to lengthy customs checks and inadequate facilities . A Russia-Finland agreement in 1997 allowed the development and eventual permanence of the border crossing . This \u20ac7 million European Union TACIS-funded project ran from 1999 and the new international frontier , capable of handling 1,300 cars per day , opened on July 3 , 2002 .",
      "Transportation .",
      "Svetogorsk is connected by railway with Kamennogorsk , where it has connection to the old Vyborg\u2013Joensuu railroad . There is suburban traffic to Vyborg . The continuation of the railroad beyond Svetogorsk to the Finnish\u2013Russian border is disused .",
      "Svetogorsk is connected by roads with Kamennogorsk and Vyborg , as well as with Imatra across the border .",

      "Agvan Dorzhiev",
      "Agvan Lobsan Dorzhiev , also Agvan Dorjiev or Dorjieff and Agvaandorj ( , , ; 1853 , Khara-Shibir ulus , \u2014 January 29 , 1938 , Ulan-Ude ) , was a Russian-born monk of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism , sometimes referred by his scholarly title as Tsenyi Khempo . He was popularly known as the Sokpo Ts\u0435nshab Ngawang Lobsang ( literally Mongolian Tsenshab Ngavang Lobsang ) to the Tibetans .",
      "He was a Khory Buryat born in the village of Khara-Shibir , not far from Ulan-Ude , east of Lake Baikal .",
      "He was a study partner and close associate of the 13th Dalai Lama , a minister of his government , and his diplomatic link with the Russian Empire . Among Tibetans he earned a legendary status , while raising the British Empires significant anxiety of Russian presence in Tibet at the final stage of the Great Game . He is also remembered for building the Buddhist temple of Saint Petersburg in 1909 and signing the Tibet-Mongolia Treaty in 1913 .",
      "Buddhist studies in Tibet .",
      "He left home in 1873 at nineteen to study at the Gomang College of the Gelugpa Drepung monastic university , near Lhasa , the largest monastery in Tibet . Having successfully completed the traditional course of religious studies , he began the academic Buddhist degree of Geshey Lharampa ( the highest level of Doctorate of Buddhist Philosophy ) . He continued his studies and , in the mid-1880s , after 15 years of study , he attained the title of a Tsanit Khenpo ( Tsanid-Hambo ) , which roughly translates as , Master of Buddhist Philosophy or Professor of Buddhist Metaphysics .",
      "He became one of the 13th Dalai Lamas teachers , a debating partner , and a spiritual adviser , and retained this role until at least the late 1910s . He was probably also instrumental in saving the young Dalai Lamas life from the intrigues at the court in Lhasa , and over the years they developed a very close and lasting relationship .",
      "Envoy for the Dalai Lama .",
      "In 1896 , the Tsar , Nikolai II , gave Agvan Dorzhiev a monogrammed watch for the services he had rendered to Badmayevs Russian agents in Lhasa .",
      "In early 1898 Dorzhiev went to Saint Petersburg to collect subscriptions for his monastic college and became friendly with Prince Esper Ukhtomsky , Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Tsar and orientalist . Dorzhiev was presented to the Tsar . Dorzhiev then went on to Paris and possibly London before returning to Lhasa .",
      "By the 1890s Dorzhiev had begun to spread the story that Russia was the mythical land of Shambhala to the north ; that its Czar might be the one to save Buddhism and that the White Tsar was an emanation of White Tara , raising hopes that he would support Tibet and its religion .",
      "Dorzhiev had suggested to the Tibetans that Russia seemed to be embracing Buddhist ideas since their recent advances into Mongolia and might prove a useful balance to British intrigues . In the spring of 1900 Dorzhiev returned to Russia with six other representatives from Thubten Gyatso ( born February 12 , 1876 ; died December 17 , 1933 ) , the 13th Dalai Lama of Tibet . They travelled through India and met the Tsar at the Livadia Palace in Crimea . When they returned they brought to Lhasa a supply of Russian arms and ammunition as well\u2014paradoxically enough\u2014as a magnificent set of Russian Episcopal robes as a personal present for the Dalai Lama .",
      "In 1901 , Thubten Ch\u00f6kyi Nyima , the Ninth Panchen Lama ( 1883\u20131937 ) , was visited by Agvan Dorzhiev . Although Dorzhiev only stayed for two days at Tashilhunpo , he received some secret teachings from the Panchen Lama , as well as readings of the Prayer of Shambhala , written by Lobsang Palden Yeshe , the Sixth ( or Third ) Panchen Lama , concerning the Buddhist kingdom of Shambhala , which were of great importance to Dorzhievs developing understanding of the Kalachakra ( Wheel of Time ) tantric teachings . Choekyi Nyima also gave Dorzhiev gifts including some golden statues .",
      "British suspicions .",
      "By 1903 , both Lord Curzon , the Viceroy of India , and Francis Younghusband became wrongly convinced that Russia and Tibet had signed secret treaties threatening the security of British interests in India and they suspected that Dorzhiev was working for the Russian government . Compounded by the closed nature of Tibet at the time , the fear of Russia drawing Tibet into the Great Game to control the routes across Asia was a reason for the British expedition to Tibet during 1903\u20134 .",
      "Obviously , the [ Fourteenth ] Dalai Lama said , the Thirteenth Dalai Lama had a keen desire to establish relations with Russia , and I also think he was a little skeptical toward England at first . Then there was Dorjiev . To the English he was a spy , but in reality he was a good scholar and a sincere Buddhist monk who had great devotion to the Thirteenth Dalai Lama .",
      "In early 1904 Dorzhiev convinced the Dalai Lama to flee to Urga in Mongolia , some 2,500 km north of Lhasa , where the Dalai Lama spent over a year giving teachings to the Mongolians .",
      "During the expedition there were rumours that Dorzhiev was in charge of the arsenal at Lhasa and directing military operations from the Gyantse Dzong ( fort ) .",
      "British troops captured several Russian-made Berdan rifles at Nagartse Dzong and breechloaders at Chumik Shenko , which heightened their suspicions of Russian involvement . These were never substantiated and there is no evidence that Dorzhiev was ever a Tsarist spy , although he had previously acted as a roving ambassador for the Dalai Lama in Russia , trying to gain support in the upper levels of Russian society .",
      "During the summer of 1912 , he met the 13th Dalai Lama at Phari Dzong and then accompanied him to the Samding Monastery , before returning to Lhasa after his exile in India .",
      "The White Tsars as incarnations of White Tara. .",
      "Since the days of Catherine the Great ( 1729\u20131796 ) , the Romanov rulers had been considered by Russian lamaists as the incarnation of White Tara , a female bodhisattva typically associated with Buddhist tantric practice and considered an emanation of Chenresig ( the bodhisattva who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas ) , and the protectress of the Tibetan people . 1913 saw the great celebrations for the 300th anniversary of the House of Romanov . Dorzhiev made speeches thanking the Tsar for his essential support for the Buddhist community in Saint Petersburg . A lama named Ulyanov published a book that same year attempting to prove that the Romanovs were directly descended from Sucandra , a legendary king of Shambhala .",
      "The Japanese monk Ekai Kawaguchi travelled in Tibet from July 4 , 1900 , to June 15 , 1902 . He reported in his Three Years in Tibet that Dorzhiev circulated a pamphlet in which he argued that the Russian Tsar was about to fulfil the old Buddhist messianic myth of Shambhala by founding a great Buddhist empire . Alas , no second source for this story is known .",
      "Vagindra script .",
      "Dorzhiev created a script for writing the Buryat language , which he called the Vagindra script after the Sanskrit version of his name .",
      "Saint Petersburg Tibetan Temple .",
      "In 1909 Dorzhiev got permission from the Tsar to build a large and substantial Buddhist datsan or temple in Saint Petersburg .",
      "The Tibet-Mongolia Treaty of 1913 .",
      "In early 1913 , Agvan Dorzhiev and two other Tibetan representatives signed a treaty in Urga , proclaiming mutual recognition and their independence from China . However , Agvan Dorzhievs authority to sign such a treaty has always been disputed by some authorities . According to Charles Bell , a British diplomat who had maintained a close relationship with the Dalai Lama , the Dalai Lama had told him that he did not authorise Dorzhiev to sign such a treaty with Mongolia .",
      "Some British authors have , based on remarks of a Tibetan diplomat some years later , even disputed the mere existence of the treaty , but scholars of Mongolia generally are very positive it exists . The Mongolian text of the treaty has , for example , been published by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in 1982 . John Snelling says : Though sometimes doubted , this Tibet-Mongolia Treaty certainly existed . It was signed on 29 December 1912 ( OS ) [ that is , by the Julian Calendar \u2013 thus making it 8th January 1913 by the Gregorian Calendar that we use ] by Dorzhiev and two Tibetans on behalf of the Dalai Lama , and by two Mongolians for the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu . He then quotes the full wording of the treaty ( in English ) from the British Public Records Office : FO [ Foreign Office ] 371 1609 7144 : Sir George Buchanan to Edward Grey , Saint Petersburg , dated February 11 , 1913 .",
      "Also in 1913 , Dorzhiev founded a manba datsan , a medical college , at the monastery of Atsagat . It quickly became an important centre of Tibetan medicine in Buryatia .",
      "After the Russian revolution .",
      "After the Russian revolution Dorzhiev was arrested and sentenced to death , only to be reprieved due to the intervention of friends in Saint Petersburg . The temple in the city was plundered and his papers destroyed .",
      "As a means of making peace with the dramatically changed politics , Dorzhiev was quick to propose the conversion of monasteries into collective farms . In 1926 the Buddhist monasteries in Buryatia were nationalised : responsibility for the management of the monasteries was transferred to collectives of laypeople and the clergy was deprived of its power . This led to much hostility , but the monasteries remained active , and the position of the reformist forces was again strengthened .",
      "Dorzhiev tried advocating for Oirat Mongol areas like Tarbagatai , Ili , and Altai to get added to the Outer Mongolian state by the Soviets . Out of concern that China would be provoked , this proposed addition of the Oirat Dzungaria to the new Outer Mongolian state was rejected by the Soviets .",
      "In August 1927 , he led and managed a conference of Tibetan doctors in Atsagat . Proposals were made for a central institute to supervise production and standardisation of Tibetan herbal remedies .",
      "Dorzhiev managed to co-exist with the Communists during the 1920s but was again arrested by the NKVD during Joseph Stalins Great Purge on November 13 , 1937 , and charged with treason , preparation for an armed uprising , and spying for the Mongolians and Japanese . He died in police custody , though apparently of cardiac arrest , after being transferred from his cell to the prison hospital on January 29 , 1938 , aged 85 .",
      "He was buried in a secret traditional burial place in the forest near Chelutai . The location of the cemetery has only been made known in recent years and some estimates say at least 40,000 people were buried there .",
      "Dorzhiev was not officially fully rehabilitated , though , until May 14 , 1990 , when the case was dismissed , on grounds of lack of evidence and absence of criminal activity .",
      "Proposed Gurdjieff connection .",
      "Rom Landau wrote a book called God is My Adventure dealing with a number of contemporary religious figures and movements , including the Graeco-Armenian mystic George Gurdjieff . In it , he speculates that Gurdjieff , who is known to have spent time in central Asia , and believed to have been engaged in spying , was Agvan Dorzhiev ( under the spelling Aghwan Dordjieff ) . The claim has been criticised by some of Gurdjieffs biographers , such as Paul Beekman Taylor and James Moore , who argues that the two men were of different age and appearance ."

      "Walter Veltroni",
      "Walter Veltroni ( ; born 3 July 1955 ) is an Italian writer , film director , journalist , and politician , who served as the first leader of the Democratic Party within the centre-left opposition , until his resignation on 17 February 2009 . He served as Mayor of Rome from June 2001 to February 2008 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Veltroni was born in Rome . His father , Vittorio Veltroni , an eminent RAI manager in the 1950s , died only one year later . His mother , Ivanka Kotnik , was the daughter of Ciril Kotnik , a Slovenian diplomat at the Holy See who helped numerous Jews and anti-fascists to escape Nazi persecution after 1943 .",
      "Political career .",
      "Veltroni joined the Italian Communist Youth Federation ( FGCI ) at the age of 15 , and was elected Rome city councillor in 1976 as member of the Italian Communist Party , serving until 1981 . He was then elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1987 . As a member of the Italian Communist Partys national secretariat , in 1988 , he played a leading role in the transformation into a social democratic party .",
      "Veltroni , a professional journalist , was editor-in-chief of LUnit\u00e0 , the newspaper of the Democratic Party of the Left from 1992-1996 . He then ran as one of the leading members of The Olive Tree coalition in the 1996 general election . After The Olive Trees victory , he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Cultural Assets and Activities from 1996 to 1998 , joining 25 other PDS members in cabinet\u2013the first ( former ) Communists to take part in government since 1947 . Also in 1996 , he joined the Bilderberg Meeting . In 1998 , he resigned , subsequent to his election as National Secretary of the Democrats of the Left ( DS ) . Despite his background as a journalist , he has been involved in controversial episodes related to freedom of expression . For example , in 2001 , after the late night show Satyricon aired an interview that discussed indictments on links between the right-wing leader and the mafia , Marco Travaglio reported that Veltroni dispatched a messenger menacing the closure of the show .",
      "Mayor of Rome .",
      "In 2001 , Veltroni resigned as leader of the party after being elected Mayor of Rome . In May 2006 , Veltroni was confirmed Mayor of Rome , easily defeating former Minister of Agriculture Gianni Alemanno , of National Alliance , obtaining an unprecedented 61.4% of the valid votes against the 37.1% achieved by his main opponent . The percentage of votes that supported Veltronis second term in office was a record in local elections in Rome . Shortly before this confirmation , Veltroni had declared that he was going to leave politics at the end of his second term as Mayor .",
      "In 2005 , as mayor of Rome , he met in Washington , during a visit to the United States , then United States Senator ( D-IL ) , Barack Obama , being one of his earliest supporters overseas . He wrote the preface to the Italian edition of The Audacity of Hope in 2007 and has been referred to as Obamas European counterpart .",
      "Veltroni was then widely considered one of the most popular centre left politicians in Italy , and often singled out for the leadership of the Democratic Party , despite his statements that he would not accept such position after his tenure as Mayor would end . In June 2007 , DS leader Piero Fassino publicly asked Veltroni to run for the party leadership , offering support from all of his party . Several other Democratic Party leading members publicly stated their support for a possible candidacy of Veltroni . Furthermore , the strongest of his possible contenders , Pier Luigi Bersani , which polls showed as having a 50% support in center-north regions , withdrew to avoid a confusing candidacy . Veltroni officially presented his candidacy for the leadership of the Democratic Party at a rally in Turin on 27 June 2007 . At this occasion he introduced the four key issues his programme would address : environment , generational pact , education , and public security .",
      "Leader of the Democratic Party .",
      "Veltroni was elected as the first leader of the newly founded Democratic Party on 14 October 2007 , winning an open primary with around 2.6 million votes , or 75.8% .",
      "In 2007 , Veltroni had some remarks against the Romanian immigrants , claiming that Italy has become unlivable since Romania joined the European Union , while before its entry , Rome was the safest city in the world , bringing accusations of xenophobia from the Romanian press .",
      "Following the defeat of Prodis government in a January 2008 Senate vote , Veltroni led the Democratic Party into the April 2008 general election . Veltroni resigned as Mayor of Rome on 13 February 2008 to concentrate on the campaign .",
      "He has been criticised for his over-frequentation of Rome socialites , and advised to focus on more practical problems .",
      "On 17 February 2009 , following clashes within the party and only a day after a heavy defeat of the Democratic Party in a local regional election in Sardinia , Veltroni announced his immediate resignation from his leadership post . The Constituent Assembly of the party subsequently convened on 21 February 2009 and elected Veltronis former deputy Dario Franceschini as the new secretary .",

He was head of the Military Office of the Ministry for Naval Affairs from 1904 to 1906 and he was promoted to captain in 1905 . Ehrensv\u00e4rd was chief of the shipyard in Karlskrona in 1906 and Council of State ( statsr\u00e5d ) and head of the Ministry for Naval Affairs from 4 December 1907 to 30 June 1910 .

      "Chicago Stadium",
      "Chicago Stadium was an indoor arena in Chicago , Illinois , that opened in 1929 , closed in 1994 and was demolished in 1995 . It was the home of the National Hockey Leagues Chicago Blackhawks and the National Basketball Associations Chicago Bulls .",
      "History .",
      "The Stadium hosted the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL from 1929 to 1994 and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA from 1967 to 1994 . The arena was the site of the first NFL playoff game in 1932 ; the 1932 , 1940 , and 1944 Democratic National Conventions ; and the 1932 and 1944 Republican National Conventions , as well as numerous concerts , rodeo competitions , boxing matches , political rallies , and plays .",
      "The Stadium was first proposed by Chicago sports promoter Paddy Harmon . Harmon wanted to bring an NHL team to Chicago , but he lost out to Col . Frederic McLaughlin . This team would soon be known as the Chicago Black Hawks ( later Blackhawks ) . Harmon then went on to at least try to get some control over the team by building a stadium for the Blackhawks to play in . He spent $2.5 million and borrowed more funds from friends , including James E . Norris , in order to build the stadium .",
      "Opened on March 28 , 1929 at a cost of $9.5 million , Chicago Stadium was the largest indoor arena in the world at the time . Detroits Olympia stadium , built two years earlier , was a model for the Chicago Stadium and had a capacity of over 15,000 people . It was also the first arena with an air conditioning system . However , the system was fairly rudimentary by modern standards , and was memorably given to filling the arena with fog during late-season basketball and hockey games .",
      "The Stadium sat 17,317 for hockey at the time of closure , though standing room pushed the actual attendance beyond that figure . The official attendance figures in the published game summaries were often given in round numbers , such as 18,500 or 20,000 . The largest recorded crowd for an NHL game at the stadium was 20,069 for a playoff game between the Blackhawks and Minnesota North Stars on April 10 , 1982 .",
      "The Madhouse on Madison .",
      "In addition to the close-quartered , triple-tiered , boxy layout of the building , much of the loud , ringing noise of the fans could be attributed to the fabled 3,663-pipe Barton organ , boasting the worlds largest theater organ console with 6 manuals ( keyboards ) and over 800 stops , and played by Al Melgard . Melgard played for decades during hockey games there , earning the Stadium the moniker The Madhouse on Madison .",
      "For years , it was also known as The Loudest Arena in the NBA , due to its barn-shaped features . When the Stadium closed in 1994 the organ was removed and prepared to be installed in the 19th hole museum . Soon after the museum closed , sending the organ along with another theatre organ to a warehouse in Phoenix Arizona . In October 1996 , a propane tank explosion melted and destroyed both pipe organs , excluding the console .",
      "The organ is currently in the residence of Phil Maloof and is in good working condition with new pipes .",
      "In the Stanley Cup semifinals of 1971 , when the Blackhawks scored a series-clinching empty-net goal in Game 7 against the New York Rangers , CBS announcer Dan Kelly reported , I can feel our broadcast booth shaking ! Thats the kind of place Chicago Stadium is right now ! The dressing rooms at the Stadium were placed underneath the seats , and the cramped corridor that led to the ice , with its twenty-two steps , became the stuff of legend . Legend has it a German Shepherd wandered the bowels at night as the security team .",
      "During the 1973 Stanley Cup Final against Montreal , Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz had the horn of his yacht ( Kahlenberg Q-3 ) installed in the building , and had it sound after Blackhawks goals . This practice would , in the ensuing years , become commonplace in professional hockey .",
      "Nancy Faust , organist for 40 years at Chicago White Sox games , also played indoors at the Stadium , at courtside for Chicago Bulls home games from 1976 to 1984 , and on the pipe organ for Chicago Blackhawks hockey there from 1985 to 1989 . She was replaced at the keyboard in 1990 by Frank Pellico , who serves as Hawks organist to this day .",
      "It also became traditional for Blackhawk fans to cheer loudly throughout the singing of the national anthems , especially when sung by Chicago favorite Wayne Messmer . Denizens of the second balcony often added sparklers and flags to the occasion . Arguably , the most memorable of these was the singing before the 1991 NHL All-Star Game , which took place during the Gulf War . This tradition has continued at the United Center . Longtime PA announcer Harvey Wittenberg had a unique monotone style : Blackhawk goal scored by #9 , Bobby Hull , unassisted , at 6:13 . The Chicago Stadium also provided a unique fan experience . On the west side of the building was the Players/Employee/VIP Visitors Parking Lot . It is also where Teams/Bands/Politicians/Performers would enter the building through the legendary Gate 3 1/2 ( Appropriately placed between Gates 3 and 4 on the North and South Sides ) . Although protected by fencing , it was where fans could see the talent get out of their cars or teams exit their buses before going into the building . It was also a great autograph and informal meet and greet opportunity .",
      "In 1992 , both the Blackhawks and the Bulls reached the finals in their respective leagues . The Blackhawks were swept in their finals by the Pittsburgh Penguins , losing at Chicago Stadium , while the Bulls won the second of their first of three straight NBA titles on their home floor against the Portland Trail Blazers . The next time the Bulls clinched the championship at home was in the newly built United Center in ( when they did so against the Seattle SuperSonics ) , their second season at the new arena , and the Blackhawks would not reach the Stanley Cup Finals again until ( in which they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in six games ) , their 16th season in the new building , although they won their first championship since in Philadelphia . The Blackhawks last won the Stanley Cup at the Stadium in ; they did not win the Cup again at home until at the United Center .",
      "Last analog game clock in any NHL arena .",
      "It was also the last NHL arena to retain the use of an analog dial-type large four-sided clock for timekeeping in professional hockey games . Boston Garden and the Detroit Olympia ( as well as the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in its pre-NHL days ) had identical scoreboards but replaced them with digital timers in the mid-1960s , with Boston having their digital four-sided clock in use for the 1969\u201370 NHL season . After removing the balcony-edge game clocks at either end and at mid-ice zones of the Stadium , the replacement four-sided game clock suspended over center ice of the Stadium , built by Bulova as their Sports Timer , was installed in Chicago in 1943 . Each side of the clock had a large diameter 20-minute face in the center that kept the main game time for one period of ice hockey , with a set of shorter black-colored minute and longer red-colored sweep-second hands , and a pair of smaller , 5-minute capacity dual-concentric faces for penalty timekeeping , to the left and right of the primary 20-minute face \u2014 with each of the 5-minute penalty timers having its own single hand and each clock face , both the central main timers dial and flanking penalty timer dials ( when a penalty was counting down ) illuminated from behind during gameplay . The outer face of each penalty timer had a single hand that avoided obscuration of the inner face and its own , solid single hand , through the use of metal rods forming the outer hands shaft , holding its hands pointer head \u2014 the set of two concentric faces for each penalty timer dial could handle two penalties for each set , with an illuminated 2 on each penalty timer dial lighting up to display a minor penalty infraction . It was difficult to read how much time was left in a period of play on the main game timers large face , as each minute of play was marked by a longer line on every third seconds increment on the central main dial , due to the minute hands twenty-minute full rotation timing capacity for one period of ice hockey . The difficulty was compounded on the main central dial from the aforementioned minute and sweep-second hands being in constant motion during gameplay . The Sports Timers only digital displays were for scoring and for penalized players numbers , each digit comprising a six-high , four-wide incandescent light dot matrix display .",
      "That clock eventually was replaced by a four-sided scoreboard with a digital clock , first used on September 21 , 1975 in Blackhawks preseason play , crafted by the Day Sign Company of Toronto , much like the one used at the end of the 1960s ( and constructed by Day Sign Company ) to replace the nearly identical Bulova Sports Timer game-timekeeping device in the Boston Garden , and then in 1985 by another , this one with a color electronic message board . That latter scoreboard was built by White Way Sign , which would build scoreboards for the United Center .",
      "The Stadium was also one of the last three NHL arenas ( the others being Boston Garden and the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium ) to have a shorter-than-regulation ice surface , as their construction predated the regulation . The distance was taken out of the neutral zone .",
      "Demolition .",
      "After the Blackhawks and Bulls moved to the United Center , the Chicago Stadium was demolished in 1995 . Its site is now a parking lot for the United Center across the street . CNN televised the demolition , showing devoted Blackhawks and Bulls fans crying as the wrecking ball hit the old building . The console of the Barton organ now resides in the Phil Maloof residence in Las Vegas , Nevada . Also , the center of the Chicago Bulls floor resides in Michael Jordans trophy room at his mansion in North Carolina .",
      "- A plaque with the words Chicago Stadium \u2013 1929\u20131994 \u2013 Remember The Roar is located behind a statue of the Blackhawks greatest players on the north side of the United Center .",
      "- Two friezes from Chicago Stadium were incorporated into a building at St . Ignatius College Prep School , 1060 W . Roosevelt Road .",
      "Two of the Stadiums main parking lots , which are still used for United Center parking , retain signs that read Peoples Stadium Parking .",

      ", also known as ANA ( \u0112-enu-\u0113 ) or , is the largest airline in Japan by revenues and passenger numbers . Its headquarters are located in Shiodome City Center in the Shiodome area of Minato ward of Tokyo . It operates services to both domestic and international destinations and had more than 20,000 employees as of March 2016 . In May 2010 , ANAs total passenger traffic was up year-on-year by 7.8% , and its international services grew by 22% to 2.07 million passengers in the first five months of 2010 .",
      "In addition to its mainline operations , ANA controls several subsidiary passenger carriers , including its regional airline , ANA Wings , Air Nippon , Air Do ( a low-cost carrier operating scheduled service between Tokyo and cities in Hokkaido ) , and Allex Cargo ( ANA Cargo - the freighter division operated by Air Japan ) . ANA is also the largest shareholder in Peach , a low-cost carrier joint venture with Hong Kong company First Eastern Investment Group . In October 1999 , the airline became a member of Star Alliance . On 29 March 2013 , ANA was named a 5-Star Airline by Skytrax . On 27 April 2018 , ANA announced ANA Business Jet Co. , Ltd. , a joint venture with Sojitz to offer private jet charter flights .",
      "History .",
      "Formation .",
      "ANAs earliest ancestor was ( also known as Nippon Helicopter and Aeroplane ) , an airline company founded on 27 December 1952 . Nippon Helicopter was the source of what would later be ANAs International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) airline code , NH .",
      "NH began helicopter services in February 1953 . On 15 December 1953 , it operated its first cargo flight between Osaka and Tokyo using a de Havilland Dove , JA5008 . This was the first scheduled flight flown by a Japanese pilot in postwar Japan . Passenger service on the same route began on 1 February 1954 , and was upgraded to a de Havilland Heron in March . In 1955 , Douglas DC-3s began flying for NH as well , by which time the airlines route network extended from northern Ky\u016bsh\u016b to Sapporo . In December 1957 Nippon Helicopter changed its name to All Nippon Airways Company .",
      "ANAs other ancestor was . Although it was founded on 26 December 1952 , one day before Nippon Helicopter , it did not begin operations until 20 January 1954 , when it began night cargo runs between Osaka and Tokyo , also using a de Havilland Dove . It adopted the DC-3 in early 1957 , by which point its route network extended through southern Japan from Tokyo to Kagoshima .",
      "Far East Airlines merged with the newly named All Nippon Airways in March 1958 . The combined companies had a total market capitalization of 600 million yen , and the result of the merger was Japans largest private airline . The merged airline received a new Japanese name ( ; ; Japan Air Transport ) . The company logo of the larger NH was selected as the logo of the new combined airline , and the new carrier operated a route network combined from its two predecessors .",
      "Domestic era .",
      "ANA grew through the 1960s , adding the Vickers Viscount to the fleet in 1960 and the Fokker F27 in 1961 . October 1961 marked ANAs debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as well as the Osaka Securities Exchange . 1963 saw another merger , with Fujita Airlines , raising the companys capital to 4.65 billion yen . In 1965 ANA introduced jets with Boeing 727s on the Tokyo-Sapporo route . It also introduced Japans first homegrown turboprop airliner , the NAMC YS-11 in 1965 , replacing Convair 440s on local routes . In 1969 , ANA introduced Boeing 737 services .",
      "As ANA grew it started to contract travel companies across Japan to handle ground services in each region . Many of these companies received shares in ANA as part of their deals . Some of these relationships continue today in different forms : for instance , Nagoya Railroad , which handled ANAs operations in the Ch\u016bbu region along with other partnerships , maintains a permanent seat on ANAs board of directors . By 1974 , ANA had Japans largest domestic airline network .",
      "While ANAs domestic operations grew , the Ministry of Transport had granted government-owned Japan Airlines ( JAL ) a monopoly on international scheduled flights that lasted until 1986 . ANA was allowed to operate international charter flights : its first was a Boeing 727 charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong on 21 February 1971 .",
      "ANA bought its first widebody aircraft , six Lockheed L-1011s , in November 1971 , following a lengthy sales effort by Lockheed which had involved negotiations between US president Richard Nixon , Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka and UK prime minister Edward Heath ( lobbying in favor of engine maker Rolls-Royce ) . Tanaka also pressed Japanese regulators to permit ANA to operate on Asia routes as part of the package . The aircraft entered service on the Tokyo-Okinawa route in 1974 . The carrier had ordered McDonnell Douglas DC-10s but cancelled the order at the last minute and switched to Lockheed . It was later revealed that Lockheed had indirectly bribed Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to force this switch : the scandal led to the arrest of Tanaka and several managers from ANA and Lockheed sales agent Marubeni for corruption .",
      "Boeing 747-200s were introduced on the Tokyo-Sapporo and Tokyo-Fukuoka routes in 1976 and Boeing 767s in 1983 on Shikoku routes . The carriers first B747s were the short-range SR variant , designed for Japanese domestic routes .",
      "International era .",
      "In 1986 , ANA began to expand beyond Japans key domestic carrier to become a competitive international carrier as well . On 3 March 1986 , ANA started scheduled international flights with a passenger service from Tokyo to Guam . Flights to Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. , followed by years end , and ANA also entered a service agreement with American Airlines to feed the US carriers new flights to Narita .",
      "ANA expanded its international services gradually : to Beijing , Dalian , Hong Kong and Sydney in 1987 ; to Seoul in 1988 ; to London and Saipan in 1989 ; to Paris in 1990 and to New York and Singapore in 1991 . Airbus equipment such as the A320 and A321 was added to the fleet in the early 1990s , as was the Boeing 747-400 jet . ANA joined the Star Alliance in October 1999 .",
      "2004 saw ANAs profits exceed JALs for the first time . That year , facing a surplus of slots due to the construction of new airports and the ongoing expansion of Tokyo International Airport , ANA announced a fleet renewal plan that would replace some of its large aircraft with a greater number of smaller aircraft .",
      "Also in 2004 , ANA set up low-cost subsidiary Air Next to operate flights from Fukuoka Airport starting in 2005 , and became the majority shareholder in Nakanihon Airline Service ( NAL ) headquartered in Nagoya Airport . In 2005 , ANA renamed NAL to Air Central , and relocated its headquarters to Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport . On 12 July 2005 , ANA reached a deal with NYK to sell its 27.6% share in Nippon Cargo Airlines , a joint venture formed between the two companies in 1987 . The sale allowed ANA to focus on developing its own cargo division . In 2006 , ANA , Japan Post , Nippon Express , and Mitsui O.S.K . Lines founded ANA & JP Express ( AJV ) , which would operate freighters . ANA is the top shareholder of AJV . It absorbed Air Japans freighter operations .",
      "Air Transport World named ANA its 2007 Airline of the Year . In 2006 , the airline was recognized by FlightOnTime.info as the most punctual scheduled airline between London and Tokyo for the last four consecutive years , based on official British statistics . Japan Airlines took over the title in 2007 . In 2009 , ANA announced plans to test an idea as part of the airlines e-flight campaign , encouraging passengers on select flights to visit the airport restroom before they board . On 10 November of the same year , ANA also announced Inspiration of Japan , ANAs newest international flight concept , with redesigned cabins initially launched on its 777-300ER aircraft .",
      "In July 2011 , All Nippon Airways and AirAsia agreed to form a low-cost carrier , called AirAsia Japan , based at Tokyos Narita International Airport . ANA held 51 percent shares and AirAsia held 33 percent voting shares and 16 percent non-voting shares through its wholly owned subsidiary , AA International . The carrier lasted until October 2013 , when AirAsia withdrew from the joint venture ; the carrier was subsequently rebranded as Vanilla Air .",
      "In March 2018 , All Nippon Airways announced the integration of its two low cost carrier subsidiaries Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air into one entity retaining the Peach name ; starting in the second half of FY2018 and to be completed by the end of FY2019 .",
      "On 29 January 2019 , ANA Holdings purchased a 9.5% stake in PAL Holdings , Philippine Airlines parent company , for US$95 million .",

From the 1970s through the late 1990s All Nippon Airways was headquartered in the Kasumigaseki Building in Chiyoda , Tokyo .

It was ordered from \u00d6resundsvarvet in Landskrona , Sweden by Rederi AB Gotland as MS Gotland , but delivered as MS Wasa Star to Vaasanlaivat / Vasab\u00e5tarna . Between 1984 and 2008 she sailed as MS Peter Wessel for Larvik Line ( until 1996 ) and Color Line , before sold to her current owners .",
      "Concept and construction .",
      "In the late 1970s the Swedish shipbuilding industry was suffering from a downturn , with little to no ships in order from Swedish shipyards . To help the industry the Swedish Prime Minister Ola Ullsten persuaded Rederi AB Gotland to order new ferries from \u00d6resundsvarvet in Landskrona . Although Rederi AB Gotland were reluctant to order new ships at first , in the end they decided to order two large , state-of-the-art ferries , capable of carrying over 2000 passengers . The first ship , MS Visby , was delivered on 10 October 1980 . The second ship , planned to be called MS Gotland , was delivered on 24 June 1981 to Rederi Ab Gotland . However , there were not enough passengers in the traffic from Gotland to the Swedish mainland , on one day following her delivery the ship was chartered to Vaasanlaivat / Vasab\u00e5tarna , Finland and officially named MS Wasa Star .",

      "On 1 July 1981 the brand new Wasa Star started traffic on the route connecting Vaasa in Finland to Sundsvall in Sweden . At the time she was by far the largest ferry to have ever sailed in the Kvarken . In February 1982 the ship was moved to the Vaasa \u2013 Ume\u00e5 route . On 14 February 1981 the ship was grounded near Holmsund . She soon came loose but her tanks were damaged , and the ship sailed to Helsinki for repairs . The local shipyard did not have a free drydock for the repairs and on 16 February 1981 the Wasa Star continued from Helsinki to Kiel , Germany where she was finally repaired at Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft .",
      "On 1 April 1982 the Wasa Star returned to the Vaasa \u2013 Sundsvall route . She was not profitable however , and on 31 August 1982 she was taken out of traffic and laid up in Sundsvall . There she remained until May 1983 , when Vaasanlaivat sub-chartered her to Karageorgios Line , Greece and she left Sundsvall for Valletta , Malta where she was docked in preparation for her new service . In June she started trafficking on a route connecting Patras , Greece to Ancona , Italy with one weekly trip from Ancona to Igoumenitsa , Greece . However , due to a payment dispute between Vaasanlaivat and Karageorgios Line Wasa Stars service in the Mediterranean remained short , and she sailed to Landskrona , Sweden to be laid up .",
      "1983\u20131996 : Larvik Line .",
      "On 29 August 1983 , after the various conflicting charter agreements were resolved , the Wasa Star was sold to the Norwegian operator Larvik Line . She left Landskrona on 13 January 1984 . In March of the same year she was renamed MS Peter Wessel , after Peter Wessel Tordenskiold and started operating on the Larvik\u2013Frederikshavn route .",
      "The Peter Wessel collided with MS Sydfjord on 27 June 1986 . the Sydfjord sunk following the collision , and 3 of her crew were evacuated on board the Peter Wessel , among the dead was the captain and his family .",
      "Peter Wessel was extended by meters at Blohm + Voss , Hamburg , Germany in 1988 . Additional cabins were also built on the top of the ship .",
      "1996\u20132008 : Color Line .",
      "In October 1996 Color Line chartered the Peter Wessel from Larvik Line , keeping her on the same route as before . In 1999 parts of the cardeck were built in with cabins , decreasing her car capacity . In spring 2003 the ship was rebuilt again , this time at Remontowa , Poland with large side sponsons for increased stabity . In 2004 Color Line bought the Peter Wessel from Larvik Line .",
      "In April 2006 the ship was transferred to the Larvik\u2014Hirtshals route . On 22 March 2007 a fire broke out in one of the ships electric switchboards , which forced her to sail to Frederikshavn . Due to repairs the ship was forced to stay out of service for over a month , returning to service on 26 April 2007 .",
      "On 19 October 2007 Color Line reported that the Peter Wessel has been sold to Mediterranean Shipping Company , to be delivered after the delivery of the new in April\u2013May 2008 . The Peter Wessel was delivered to her new owners on 16 April 2008 and subsequently renamed MS SNAV Toscana .",
      "2008 onwards : SNAV-GNV .",
      "On 19 April 2008 the SNAV Toscana left Norway for the Mediterranean . She entered service on SNAVs Civitavecchia\u2014Palermo or Civitavecchia \u2013 Olbia service during 2008 . Now the ship services Genova \u2013 Porto Torres route . Since 2017 , SNAV Toscana was renamed as GNV Azzurra ."

It is one of the three Triple Crown events , and although not a ranking event , it is regarded as one of the most prestigious tournaments on the circuit . The reigning champion is Yan Bingtao .",
      "The Masters began as an invitational event for 10 top players . The field was expanded to 12 competitors in 1981 , and 16 in 1983 .

Stephen Hendry has won six titles , Cliff Thorburn , Steve Davis , Mark Selby and Paul Hunter three , and Alex Higgins , Mark Williams and John Higgins two . In 2016 , the Masters trophy was renamed the Paul Hunter Trophy in honour of the three-time champion , who died in 2006 , aged 27 . The oldest Masters champion is Stuart Bingham , who was aged 43 years and 243 days in 2020 . The youngest champion is OSullivan , who won his first title in 1995 , aged 19 years and 69 days .",

      "History .",
      "1975\u20131983 .",
      "The tournament was held for the first time in 1975 at the West Centre Hotel in London , when ten leading players were invited . The event was sponsored by the cigarette company Benson & Hedges . John Spencer won the inaugural tournament by defeating Ray Reardon 9\u20138 in the final . The following year the event moved to the New London Theatre and in 1979 to the Wembley Conference Centre .",
      "In 1981 the number of players invited to compete was increased to 12 , and then increased again to 16 in 1983 .",
      "1984\u20132003 .",
      "From 1984 onwards the top 16 players in the world rankings were automatically invited to the tournament . In 1984 , Kirk Stevens became the first player to make a maximum break at the event against Jimmy White in the semi-final . In 1988 , Mike Hallett became the first and to date only player to be whitewashed in a Masters final , losing 0\u20139 to Steve Davis . Stephen Hendry maintained an unbeaten record in the event , a run which included five successive championship victories , from his first appearance in 1989 until his defeat by Alan McManus in a final-frame decider in the 1994 final . Hallett reached his second final in four years in 1991 , but lost 8\u20139 against Hendry , despite leading 7\u20130 and 8\u20132 . This defeat effectively ended Halletts days as a major force in the game .",
      "In 1990 the sponsors introduced two wild-cards , granted by the games governing body at their discretion , who would play wild-card matches against the players seeded 15th and 16th for a place in the first round of the tournament . The Benson & Hedges Championship was introduced for the 1991 tournament ; the winner was granted one of the two wild-card places at that seasons Masters tournament , while the other wild-card place continued to be granted by the governing body .",
      "In the 1997 final , Steve Davis defeated Ronnie OSullivan in a match disrupted by a streaker . Davis came back from 4\u20138 down to win the remaining six frames in a row , clinching the final at 10\u20138 . The 1998 final went down to a re-spotted black in the deciding frame ; Mark Williams defeated Stephen Hendry 10\u20139 after having trailed 6\u20139 . In the 2000 final , Ken Doherty missed the final black in a 147 attempt , the first time this had happened in competition , and eventually lost to Matthew Stevens .",

      "After 2003 , Benson & Hedges ended their sponsorship of the Masters tournament due to UK restrictions on tobacco advertising . The 2004 event was not sponsored . Rileys Club sponsored the event in 2005 . There was no separate qualifying competition for the 2005 event , both wild-card places being awarded by the governing body , but the qualifying event returned the following season . SAGA Insurance took over sponsorship of the Masters in 2006 and agreed a deal later the same year to sponsor the event until 2009 . The tournament was held at the Wembley Conference Centre for the last time in 2006 , before the venue was demolished months later to make way for redevelopment .",
      "Following the death of Paul Hunter in October 2006 , Jimmy White led calls for the Masters trophy or tournament to be renamed in honour of Hunter , who had won the title three times in four years between 2001 and 2004 . Hunters widow Lindsey later expressed her wishes for the trophy to be renamed , claiming that ...everybody expected it . Every player Ive spoken to , every fan , thought it would be a definite . The sports governing body , World Snooker , elected not to rename the trophy , making the following statement : Our board unanimously agreed that the Paul Hunter Scholarship was the most fitting tribute . Just as Hunter himself rose swiftly through the amateur ranks , the scholarship will give a gifted young player the chance to fulfil his talent through elite training . It would be another nine years before the decision was taken to rename the trophy in honour of Hunter . On 20 April 2016 , World Snooker announced the renaming of the trophy for the 2017 event , with chairman Barry Hearn stating that the organisation had messed up by not doing so sooner .",
      "Ronnie OSullivan appeared in four successive Masters finals from 2004 to 2007 , winning the event in 2005 and 2007 . Paul Hunter won the first of these four finals to claim his third Masters title in four years ; recovering from 2\u20137 down , he made five century breaks on the way to a 10\u20139 victory . OSullivan defeated John Higgins in the 2005 final with a decisive 10\u20133 scoreline . The pair met in the final again the following year , both players producing a very high standard of play throughout the match . OSullivan won the second and third frames with back-to-back total clearances of 138 and 139 , but lost all of the next five frames . He made a break of 60 in the deciding frame , before Higgins took the opportunity to make a clearance of 64 , winning the title on the black . However , OSullivan redeemed himself in 2007 by defeating Ding Junhui 10\u20133 in the final , and then comforting the clearly upset youngster afterwards . A week earlier , Ding had become the second player to compile a maximum break at the Masters , in his match against Anthony Hamilton in the wild-card round .",

In a slight change to the format , one extra discretionary wild-card place was awarded , bringing the total number of players up to 19 . However , the original format with just two wild-card players was reinstated in 2008 . SAGA Insurance pulled out of their sponsorship deal in the summer of 2008 , leaving the Masters unsponsored in 2009 . PokerStars.com sponsored the event in 2010 , and the 2011 sponsor was Ladbrokes Mobile . The separate qualifying competition was not held for the 2011 event , and the use of wild-cards was discontinued at the same time . The 2011 final made history as it was the first to feature two Asian players . Wembley Arena was used as the venue for the last time in 2011 , after which the tournament moved to the Alexandra Palace in London . BGC Partners sponsored the Masters in 2012 , and the 2013 event was sponsored by Betfair . From 2014 to 2020 the tournament was sponsored by Dafabet . In 2021 Betfred sponsors the Masters .",

With the introduction of the wild-card round in 1990 , this system meant that seeds 15 and 16 needed to win a match to reach the last 16 , where they would immediately play either of the first two seeds , generally the defending Masters champion and the World Champion .

In most years one of the additional players was the winner of the Masters Qualifying Event while the other wild-card was selected .

The tournament continued to be played over 8 days but three matches were played on Sunday and Monday instead of the usual two ( and Tuesday in 2007 ) , so that the last-16 round was still completed on Wednesday . In 2007 all three wild-card matches were played on the first Sunday so that the last-16 round did not start until Monday .",
      "There were a total of 43 wild-card matches . In 19 of these matches the seeded player played the winner of the Qualifying Event . In the remaining 24 matches the seed played a selected wild-card . The players selected as wild-card were Jimmy White ( 5 ) , Ding Junhui ( 3 ) , Steve Davis ( 2 ) , Marco Fu ( 2 ) , James Wattana ( 2 ) , Ken Doherty , Peter Ebdon , Andy Hicks , Alex Higgins , John Higgins , Paul Hunter , Stephen Maguire , Ian McCulloch , Ricky Walden and Gary Wilkinson .",
      "None of the players who played in the wild-card round won the tournament although two players , John Higgins ( in 1995 ) and Ding Junhui ( in 2007 ) reached the final . Both these players were wild-card selections . Two seeded players who played in the wild-card round reached the semi-final , Jimmy White ( in 2004 ) and Mark Williams ( in 2010 ) . The winner of the Qualifying Event never got beyond the last-16 round ."

      "Following the death of Sergeant La David Johnson on October 4 , 2017 , in an attack in Niger , Wilson told the press that on October 16 , 2017 , President Donald Trump had called Johnsons widow while she was on the way to Miami International Airport for the arrival of Johnsons remains . In the car with her were Johnsons mother and other family members , as well as Wilson , a long-time friend of the family . The widow put the call on speakerphone so that Wilson and others in the car heard it . Wilson stated Trump was almost like joking and that he said he [ Johnson ] knew what he signed up for , but I guess it still hurt . Donald Trump later called Wilsons characterization of the conversation a fabrication . Johnsons mother confirmed Wilsons account on October 18 , at which point the White House ceased disputing Wilsons account of the phone call and instead claimed that she was mischaracterizing the spirit of the conversation . On October 23 , Johnsons widow also confirmed Wilsons account .",
      "On October 19 , 2017 , White House Chief of Staff John F . Kelly gave a press briefing at the White House . Kelly , who is a gold star parent and was present at Trumps end during the phone conversation , did not deny that Trump said the words reported . But he defended Trumps comments forcefully and emotionally , saying that Trump in his way tried to express that opinion that he\u2019s a brave man , a fallen hero . He also attacked Wilson for having listened to the phone call and claimed that she had a history of politicizing what should be sacred moments , citing the 2015 dedication of an FBI field office in Miami as an example . He claimed that her speech at that ceremony was about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building from then-President Barack Obama .",
      "The details of Kellys statement were disproven by the video recording of the event . During her nine-minute speech , Wilson spoke for less than three minutes about leading an effort to expedite a bill through Congress . The bills purpose was naming the FBI building after two FBI agents slain in the line of duty ; the bill would normally not have become law in time for the buildings dedication ceremony . Wilson dedicated the remainder of her speech to acknowledging other politicians involved in the effort , thanking FBI personnel , and talking about the slain agents . The FBI secured the buildings funding in 2009 , before Wilson became a congresswoman in 2011 . The Miami Herald reported that Kelly had misquoted the cost of the building as $20 million versus the actual $194 million . As a result , several newspapers have called for Kelly to apologize to Wilson . The White House said the video did not capture all of Wilsons comments .",

      "GER Classes S46 , D56 and H88",
      "The GER Classes S46 , D56 and H88 ( classified Classes D14 , D15 , and D16 by the London and North Eastern Railway ) were three classes of similar 4-4-0 steam locomotive designed by James Holden ( S46 and D56 ) and A . J . Hill ( H88 ) for the Great Eastern Railway .",
      "They were given the nickname Claud Hamilton after the pioneer engine of the class , named after Lord Claud Hamilton ( 1843\u20131925 ) the chairman of the Great Eastern Railway . The D56 class of 1903-4 evolved the design to include a square-topped Belpaire firebox . The H88 class of 1923 featured a larger superheated boiler , leading them to be known as Super Clauds . Many earlier members of the class were rebuilt during their working life .",
      "During the Edwardian era , they were the flagship express locomotive on the Great Eastern Main Line , and although displaced on the heaviest express trains by the larger S69 class from 1911 ( itself a 4-6-0 development of the Claud design ) , members of the class were used on passenger and goods services throughout the Eastern Region until 1960 . No locomotives of the three classes survived to preservation .",
      "Design .",
      "The Claud Hamilton , particularly in its original GER blue livery , is widely considered one of the most elegant locomotive designs of the pre-grouping era .",
      "In his 1955 history of the Great Eastern Railway , Cecil J . Allen devotes a whole chapter to the class and noted that",
      "Of all the locomotive designs that emerged from Stratford Works during the reign of James Holden , the one destined to achieve the greatest fame , beyond question , was his Claud Hamilton type 4-4-0 , of which the pioneer example , No . 1900 Claud Hamilton , took the rails in 1900 .",
      "Although credited to James Holden , the Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Eastern , Frederick Vernon Russell ( Holdens Chief Designer ) is thought to have contributed substantially to the design of the Claud Hamiltons ; while researching his Some Classic Locomotives of 1949 , C.H . Ellis was informed by Russell that during the process of designing the locomotive Mr Holden , by then a valetudinarian was making a long recuperative stay in Egypt .",
      "The 4-4-0 inside cylinder locomotive included a number of features that were to appear on later Great Eastern locomotive classes , including a circular polished steel smokebox door surround ( instead of the usual horizontal straps ) and decorative splashers . Class pioneer No 1900 Claud Hamilton featuring red lining and connecting rods , copper chimney cap and GER coat of arms was much admired when it was exhibited at the 1900 Paris Exposition .",
      "The original S46 boiler had of heating surface , with a grate . The cylinders were 19 x 26 in . with flat valves placed below , operated by Stephensons motion . The coupled wheels were in diameter .",
      "Allen reports that Claud Hamiltons in their original state were capable of taking around 350 tons from Liverpool Street to North Walsham in under the booked time . No . 1882 with round-top boiler ran the in 156 min 60 sec . Even heavier trains were managed in the up direction : No . 1809 ( Belpaire boiler ) took 400 tons up in 157 minutes 24 seconds .",
      "The S46 design was substantially modified in later incarnations , particularly with the introduction of a larger superheated boiler on the H88 designed by Alfred John Hill . Most earlier members of the class were substantially modified by Hill or during the tenure of Sir Nigel Gresley as CME of the LNER from 1923 .",
      "Two separate classes were also developed from the design of the Claud Hamilton ; Holdens Class F48 ( constructed between 1900 and 1903 ) was essentially an 0-6-0 goods version of the S46 and the Class S69 ( built between 1911 and 1921 ) was a larger 4-6-0 version using many of the same design cues as the H88 , built to replace the Clauds on the heaviest express trains .",
      "Classification and numbering .",
      "The classification of the Claud Hamiltons is complex but is summarised here :",
      "- GER Class S46 ( LNER Class D14 ) , 4 ft 9 in diameter boiler , round-top firebox",
      "- GER Class D56 ( LNER Class D15 ) , 4 ft 9 in diameter boiler , Belpaire firebox",
      "- LNER Class D15/1 , D15 as built with short smokebox , some with superheater",
      "- LNER Class D15/2 , D15 with superheater and long smokebox",
      "- GER Class H88 ( LNER Class D16 ) , Super Claud with superheater , larger boiler ( 5 ft in diameter ) and Belpaire firebox",
      "- LNER Class D16/1 , D16 as built ( with short smokebox )",
      "- LNER Class D16/2 , as D16/1 but with extended smokebox",
      "- LNER Class D16/3 , Gresley rebuild of D15 and D16 with round-top firebox , some with piston valves",
      "The class pioneer was numbered 1900 ( to coincide with the year the locomotive was built ) , with subsequent batches numbered backwards in tens as follows :",
      "The Railway Magazine of November 1923 includes the log of a run from Liverpool Street to Ipswich with 4-4-0 number 1780 , so this loco at least must have carried a GER number .",
      "Appearance .",
      "Originally painted in GER blue with red lining and bronze highlights , following the 1923 grouping the GER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway , and were painted in the companys apple green with LNER on the tender and cab-side numbers . Side rods were polished steel . The appearance was altered when a larger boiler and Belpaire firebox was fitted , meaning a change in the cab window shape as well .",
      "8783 and 8787 were kept in immaculate condition as dedicated Royal locos for hauling the Royal Train from Kings Cross to Wolferton ( the nearest station for Sandringham House ) . 8783 was also fitted with a copper-capped chimney . Later some locos carried numbers and London & North Eastern Railway on the tender . During the Second World War most were repainted into unlined black livery with the letters N E on the tender . Royal Claud 8783 retained its LNER apple green livery into British Railways days ( after 1948 ) , but with BRITISH RAILWAYS on the tender initially .",
      "Others were painted black with BRITISH RAILWAYS on the tender . Later on they carried both lined and unlined black with the early BR crest and those which survived after 1956 lined and unlined black with the later crest . Many of the class retained steel smokebox door rings until withdrawal , except those rebuilt by Gresley with a larger boiler which also required a new smokebox . Many locos had their decorative valances removed in later years as well , though they still retained their distinctive character .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "- On 1 January 1915 , locomotive No . 1813 was hauling an express passenger train that overran signals and collided with a local passenger train at , Essex . Ten people were killed and more than 500 were injured .",
      "- On 12 February 1927 , locomotive No . 8808 was hauling an express passenger train that was in collision with a lorry on a level crossing at Tottenham , London . Due to foggy conditions , the train was not travelling at a high speed .",

      "Arnolfini Portrait",
      "The Arnolfini Portrait ( or The Arnolfini Wedding , The Arnolfini Marriage , the Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife , or other titles ) is a 1434 oil painting on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck . It forms a full-length double portrait , believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife , presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges .",
      "It is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art , because of its beauty , complex iconography , geometric orthogonal perspective , and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror . According to Ernst Gombrich in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatellos or Masaccios work in Italy . A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic .. . For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term . The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract , recorded as a painting . Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434 , it is , with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert , the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera . The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842 .",
      "Van Eyck used the technique of applying several layers of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour . The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism , and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfinis world . Van Eyck took advantage of the longer drying time of oil paint , compared to tempera , to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms . The wet-in-wet ( wet-on-wet ) , technique , also known as alla prima , is highly utilized by Renaissance painters including Jan van Eyck . The medium of oil paint also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely . He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces . It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror .",
      "The illusionism of the painting was remarkable for its time , in part for the rendering of detail , but particularly for the use of light to evoke space in an interior , for its utterly convincing depiction of a room , as well of the people who inhabit it . Whatever meaning is given to the scene and its details , and there has been much debate on this , according to Craig Harbison the painting is the only fifteenth-century Northern panel to survive in which the artists contemporaries are shown engaged in some sort of action in a contemporary interior . It is indeed tempting to call this the first genre painting \u2013 a painting of everyday life \u2013 of modern times .",
      "Description .",
      "The painting is generally in very good condition , though with small losses of original paint and damages , which have mostly been retouched . Infrared reflectograms of the painting show many small alterations , or pentimenti , in the underdrawing : to both faces , to the mirror , and to other elements . The couple are shown in an upstairs room with a chest and a bed in it during early summer as indicated by the fruit on the cherry tree outside the window . The room probably functioned as a reception room , as it was the fashion in France and Burgundy where beds in reception rooms were used as seating , except , for example , when a mother with a new baby received visitors . The window has six interior wooden shutters , but only the top opening has glass , with clear bulls-eye pieces set in blue , red and green stained glass .",
      "The two figures are very richly dressed ; despite the season both their outer garments , his tabard and her dress , are trimmed and fully lined with fur . The furs may be the especially expensive sable for him and ermine or miniver for her . He wears a hat of plaited straw dyed black , as often worn in the summer at the time . His tabard was more purple than it appears now ( as the pigments have faded over time ) and may be intended to be silk velvet ( another very expensive item ) . Underneath he wears a doublet of patterned material , probably silk damask . Her dress has elaborate dagging ( cloth folded and sewn together , then cut and frayed decoratively ) on the sleeves , and a long train . Her blue underdress is also trimmed with white fur .",
      "Although the womans plain gold necklace and the rings that both wear are the only jewellery visible , both outfits would have been enormously expensive , and appreciated as such by a contemporary viewer . There may be an element of restraint in their clothes ( especially the man ) befitting their merchant status \u2013 portraits of aristocrats tend to show gold chains and more decorated cloth , although the restrained colours of the mans clothing correspond to those favoured by Duke Phillip of Burgundy .",
      "The interior of the room has other signs of wealth ; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards , and would have been very expensive . It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above , to lower it for managing the candles ( possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room ) . The convex mirror at the back , in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass , is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date \u2013 another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck . There is also no sign of a fireplace ( including in the mirror ) , nor anywhere obvious to put one . Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth ; they were very expensive in Burgundy , and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini . Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall ( to the right , partly hidden by the bed ) , also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed ; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables , as they still do in the Netherlands . There existed a friendship between Giovanni Arnolfini and Philip the Good who sent his court painter Jan van Eyck to portray Arnolfini Double . The relation possibly began with a tapestry order including the images of Notre Dame Cathedral in return of a good payment .",
      "The view in the mirror shows two figures just inside the door that the couple are facing . The second figure , wearing red , is presumably the artist although , unlike Vel\u00e1zquez in Las Meninas , he does not seem to be painting . Scholars have made this assumption based on the appearance of figures wearing red head-dresses in some other van Eyck works ( e.g. , the Portrait of a Man ( Self Portrait? ) and the figure in the background of the Madonna with Chancellor Rolin ) . The dog is an early form of the breed now known as the Brussels griffon .",
      "The painting is signed , inscribed and dated on the wall above the mirror : Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434 ( Jan van Eyck was here 1434 ) . The inscription looks as if it were painted in large letters on the wall , as was done with proverbs and other phrases at this period . Other surviving van Eyck signatures are painted in trompe-l\u0153il on the wooden frame of his paintings , so that they appear to have been carved in the wood .",
      "Identity of subjects .",
      "In their book published in 1857 , Crowe and Cavalcaselle were the first to link the double portrait with the early 16th century inventories of Margaret of Austria . They suggested that the painting showed portraits of Giovanni [ di Arrigo ] Arnolfini and his wife . Four years later James Weale published a book in which he agreed with this analysis and identified Giovannis wife as Jeanne ( or Giovanna ) Cenami . For the next century most art historians accepted that the painting was a double portrait of Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini and his wife Jeanne Cenami but a chance discovery in 1997 established that they were married in 1447 , thirteen years after the date on the painting and six years after van Eycks death .",
      "It is now believed that the subject is either Giovanni di Arrigo or his cousin , Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini , and a wife of either one of them . This is either an undocumented first wife of Giovanni di Arrigo or a second wife of Giovanni di Nicolao , or , according to a recent proposal , Giovanni di Nicolaos first wife Costanza Trenta , who had died perhaps in childbirth by February 1433 . In the latter case , this would make the painting partly an unusual memorial portrait , showing one living and one dead person . Details such as the snuffed candle above the woman , the scenes after Christs death on her side of the background roundel , and the black garb of the man , support this view . Both Giovanni di Arrigo and Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini were Italian merchants , originally from Lucca , but resident in Bruges since at least 1419 . The man in this painting is the subject of a further portrait by van Eyck in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie , Berlin , leading to speculation he was a friend of the artist .",
      "Scholarly debate .",
      "In 1934 Erwin Panofsky published an article entitled Jan van Eycks Arnolfini Portrait in the Burlington Magazine , arguing that the elaborate signature on the back wall , and other factors , showed that it was painted as a legal record of the occasion of the marriage of the couple , complete with witnesses and a witness signature . Panofsky also argues that the many details of domestic items in the painting each have a disguised symbolism attached to their appearance . While Panofskys claim that the painting formed a kind of certificate of marriage is not accepted by all art historians , his analysis of the symbolic function of the details is broadly agreed , and has been applied to many other Early Netherlandish paintings , especially a number of depictions of the Annunciation set in richly detailed interiors , a tradition for which the Arnolfini Portrait and the M\u00e9rode Altarpiece by Robert Campin represent the start ( in terms of surviving works at least ) .",
      "Since then , there has been considerable scholarly argument among art historians on the occasion represented . Edwin Hall considers that the painting depicts a betrothal , not a marriage . Margaret D . Carroll argues that the painting is a portrait of a married couple that alludes also to the husbands grant of legal authority to his wife . Carroll also proposes that the portrait was meant to affirm Giovanni Arnolfinis good character as a merchant and aspiring member of the Burgundian court . She argues that the painting depicts a couple , already married , now formalizing a subsequent legal arrangement , a mandate , by which the husband hands over to his wife the legal authority to conduct business on her own or his behalf ( similar to a power of attorney ) . The claim is not that the painting had any legal force , but that van Eyck played upon the imagery of legal contract as a pictorial conceit . While the two figures in the mirror could be thought of as witnesses to the oath-taking , the artist himself provides ( witty ) authentication with his notarial signature on the wall .",
      "Jan Baptist Bedaux agrees somewhat with Panofsky that this is a marriage contract portrait in his 1986 article The reality of symbols : the question of disguised symbolism in Jan van Eycks Arnolfini Portrait . However , he disagrees with Panofskys idea of items in the portrait having hidden meanings . Bedaux argues , if the symbols are disguised to such an extent that they do not clash with reality as conceived at the time .. . there will be no means of proving that the painter actually intended such symbolism . He also conjectures that if these disguised symbols were normal parts of the marriage ritual , then one could not say for sure whether the items were part of a disguised symbolism or just social reality .",
      "Craig Harbison takes the middle ground between Panofsky and Bedaux in their debate about disguised symbolism and realism . Harbison argues that Jan van Eyck is there as storyteller .. . [ who ] must have been able to understand that , within the context of peoples lives , objects could have multiple associations , and that there are many possible purposes for the portrait and ways it can be interpreted . He maintains that this portrait cannot be fully interpreted until scholars accept the notion that objects can have multiple associations . Harbison urges the notion that one needs to conduct a multivalent reading of the painting that includes references to the secular and sexual context of the Burgundian court , as well as religious and sacramental references to marriage .",
      "Lorne Campbell in the National Gallery Catalogue sees no need to find a special meaning in the painting : .. . there seems little reason to believe that the portrait has any significant narrative content . Only the unnecessary lighted candle and the strange signature provoke speculation . He suggests that the double portrait was very possibly made to commemorate a marriage , but not a legal record and cites examples of miniatures from manuscripts showing similarly elaborate inscriptions on walls as a normal form of decoration at the time . Another portrait in the National Gallery by van Eyck , Portrait of a Man ( Leal Souvenir ) , has a legalistic form of signature .",
      "Margaret Kosters new suggestion , discussed above and below , that the portrait is a memorial one , of a wife already dead for a year or so , would displace these theories . Art historian Maximiliaan Martens has suggested that the painting was meant as a gift for the Arnolfini family in Italy . It had the purpose of showing the prosperity and wealth of the couple depicted . He feels this might explain oddities in the painting , for example why the couple are standing in typical winter clothing while a cherry tree is in fruit outside , and why the phrase Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434 is featured so large in the centre of the painting . Herman Colenbrander has proposed that the painting may depict an old German custom of a husband promising a gift to his bride on the morning after their wedding night . He has also suggested that the painting may have been a present from the artist to his friend .",
      "In 2016 , French physician Jean-Philippe Postel , in his book LAffaire Arnolfini , agreed with Koster that the woman is dead , but he suggested that she is appearing to the man as a spectre , asking him to pray for her soul .",
      "Interpretation and symbolism .",
      "Figures and marriage .",
      "It is thought that the couple are already married because of the womans headdress . A non-married woman would have her hair down , according to Margaret Carroll . The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles \u2013 the woman stands near the bed and well into the room , symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house and solidifying her in a domestic role , whereas Giovanni stands near the open window , symbolic of his role in the outside world . Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer ; his wife gazes obediently at her husband . His hand is vertically raised , representing his commanding position of authority , whilst she has her hand in a lower , horizontal , more submissive pose . However , her gaze at her husband can also show her equality to him because she is not looking down at the floor as lower-class women would . They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal , not his subordinate .",
      "The symbolism behind the action of the couples joined hands has also been debated among scholars . Many point to this gesture as proof of the paintings purpose . Is it a marriage contract or something else ? Panofsky interprets the gesture as an act of fides , Latin for marital oath . He calls the representation of the couple qui desponsari videbantur per fidem which means , who were contracting their marriage by marital oath . The man is grasping the womans right hand with his left , which is the basis for the controversy . Some scholars like Jan Baptist Bedaux and Peter Schabacker argue that if this painting does show a marriage ceremony , then the use of the left hand points to the marriage being morganatic and not clandestine . A marriage is said to be morganatic if a man marries a woman of unequal rank . However , the subjects originally thought by most scholars to be represented in this painting , Giovanni Arnolfini and Giovanna Cenami , were of equal status and rank in the courtly system , so the theory would not hold true . On the opposite side of the debate are scholars like Margaret Carroll . She suggests that the painting deploys the imagery of a contract between an already married couple giving the wife the authority to act on her husbands behalf in business dealings . Carroll identifies Arnolfinis raised right hand as a gesture of oath-taking known as fidem levare , and his joining hands with his wife as a gesture of consent known as fides manualis .",
      "Although many viewers assume the wife to be pregnant , this is not believed to be so . Art historians point to numerous paintings of female virgin saints similarly dressed , and believe that this look was fashionable for womens dresses at the time . Fashion would have been important to Arnolfini , especially since he was a cloth merchant . The more cloth a person wore , the more wealthy he or she was assumed to be . Another indication that the woman is not pregnant is that Giovanna Cenami ( the identification of the woman according to most earlier scholars ) died childless , as did Costanza Trenta ( a possible identification according to recent archival evidence ) ; whether a hypothetical unsuccessful pregnancy would have been left recorded in a portrait is questionable , although if it is indeed Constanza Trenta , as Koster proposed , and she died in childbirth , then the oblique reference to pregnancy gains strength . Moreover , the beauty ideal embodied in contemporary female portraits and clothing rest in the first place on the high valuation on the ability of women to bear children . Harbison maintains her gesture is merely an indication of the extreme desire of the couple shown for fertility and progeny .",
      "There is a carved figure as a finial on the bedpost , probably of Saint Margaret , patron saint of pregnancy and childbirth , who was invoked to assist women in labor and to cure infertility , or possibly representing Saint Martha , the patroness of housewives . From the bedpost hangs a brush , symbolic of domestic duties . Furthermore , the brush and the rock crystal prayer-beads ( a popular engagement present from the future bridegroom ) appearing together on either side of the mirror may also allude to the dual Christian injunctions ora et labora ( pray and work ) . According to Jan Baptist Bedaux , the broom could also symbolize proverbial chastity ; it sweeps out impurities .",
      "Mirror .",
      "The small medallions set into the frame of the convex mirror at the back of the room show tiny scenes from the Passion of Christ and may represent Gods promise of salvation for the figures reflected on the mirrors convex surface . Furthering the Memorial theory , all the scenes on the wifes side are of Christs death and resurrection . Those on the husbands side concern Christs life . The mirror itself may represent the eye of God observing the vows of the wedding . A spotless mirror was also an established symbol of Mary , referring to the Holy Virgins immaculate conception and purity . The mirror reflects two figures in the doorway , one of whom may be the painter himself . In Panofskys controversial view , the figures are shown to prove that the two witnesses required to make a wedding legal were present , and Van Eycks signature on the wall acts as some form of actual documentation of an event at which he was himself present .",
      "According to one author The painting is often referenced for its immaculate depiction of non-Euclidean geometry , referring to the image on the convex mirror . Assuming a spherical mirror , the distortion has been correctly portrayed , except for the leftmost part of the window frame , the near edge of the table and the hem of the dress .",
      "Other objects .",
      "The little dog symbolizes fidelity ( fido ) , loyalty , or can be seen as an emblem of lust , signifying the couples desire to have a child . Unlike the couple , he looks out to meet the gaze of the viewer . The dog could also be simply a lap dog , a gift from husband to wife . Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions . So , the dog could reflect the wealth of the couple and their position in courtly life . The dog , in the painting , is a Griffon terrier , or it could have been a Bolognese dog .",
      "The green of the womans dress symbolizes hope , possibly the hope of becoming a mother . The bright green colour is also indicative of the couples wealth ; dyeing fabric such a shade was difficult , and therefore expensive . Her white cap could signify purity , but probably signifies her being married . Behind the pair , the curtains of the marriage bed have been opened ; the red curtains might allude to the physical act of love between the married couple .",
      "The single candle in the left-front holder of the ornate six-branched chandelier is possibly the candle used in traditional Flemish marriage customs . Lit in full daylight , like the sanctuary lamp in a church , the candle may allude to the presence of the Holy Ghost or the ever-present eye of God . Alternatively , Margaret Koster posits that the painting is a memorial portrait , as the single lit candle on Giovannis side contrasts with the burnt-out candle whose wax stub can just be seen on his wifes side , evoking a common literary metaphor : he lives on , she is dead .",
      "The cherries present on the tree outside the window may symbolize love . The oranges which lie on the window sill and chest may symbolize the purity and innocence that reigned in the Garden of Eden before the Fall of Man . They were uncommon and a sign of wealth in the Netherlands , but in Italy were a symbol of fecundity in marriage . The fruit could more simply be a sign of the couples wealth since oranges were very expensive imports . It could be a sign of fertility as well .",
      "In January 2018 the womans dress was the subject of the BBC Four programme A Stitch in Time with fashion historian Amber Butchart .",
      "Provenance .",
      "The provenance of the painting begins in 1434 when it was dated by van Eyck and presumably owned by the sitter ( s ) . At some point before 1516 it came into the possession of Don Diego de Guevara ( d . Brussels 1520 ) , a Spanish career courtier of the Habsburgs ( himself the subject of a fine portrait by Michael Sittow in the National Gallery of Art ) . He lived most of his life in the Netherlands , and may have known the Arnolfinis in their later years .",
      "By 1516 he had given the portrait to Margaret of Austria , Habsburg Regent of the Netherlands , when it shows up as the first item in an inventory of her paintings , made in her presence at Mechelen . The item says ( in French ) : a large picture which is called Hernoul le Fin with his wife in a chamber , which was given to Madame by Don Diego , whose arms are on the cover of the said picture ; done by the painter Johannes . A note in the margin says It is necessary to put on a lock to close it : which Madame has ordered to be done . In a 1523\u20134 Mechelen inventory , a similar description is given , although this time the name of the subject is given as Arnoult Fin .",
      "In 1530 the painting was inherited by Margarets niece Mary of Hungary , who in 1556 went to live in Spain . It is clearly described in an inventory taken after her death in 1558 , when it was inherited by Philip II of Spain . A painting of two of his young daughters , ( Prado ) , commissioned by Philip clearly copies the pose of the figures . In 1599 a German visitor saw it in the Alcazar Palace in Madrid . Now it had verses from Ovid painted on the frame : See that you promise : what harm is there in promises ? In promises anyone can be rich . It is very likely that Vel\u00e1zquez knew the painting , which may have influenced his Las Meninas , which shows a room in the same palace .",
      "In 1700 the painting appeared in an inventory after the death of Carlos II with shutters and the verses from Ovid .",
      "The painting survived the fire in the Alcazar which destroyed some of the Spanish royal collection , and by 1794 had been moved to the Palacio Nuevo , the present Royal Palace of Madrid . In 1816 the painting was in London , in the possession of Colonel James Hay , a Scottish soldier . He claimed that after he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Waterloo the previous year , the painting hung in the room where he convalesced in Brussels . He fell in love with it , and persuaded the owner to sell . More relevant to the real facts is no doubt Hays presence at the Battle of Vitoria ( 1813 ) in Spain , where a large coach loaded by King Joseph Bonaparte with easily portable artworks from the royal collections was first plundered by British troops , before what was left was recovered by their commanders and returned to the Spanish .",
      "Hay offered the painting to the Prince Regent , later George IV of the United Kingdom , via Sir Thomas Lawrence . The Prince had it on approval for two years at Carlton House before eventually returning it in 1818 . Around 1828 , Hay gave it to a friend to look after , not seeing it or the friend for the next thirteen years , until he arranged for it to be included in a public exhibition in 1841 . It was bought the following year ( 1842 ) by the recently formed National Gallery , London for \u00a3600 , as inventory number 186 , where it remains . By then the shutters had gone , along with the original frame .",

      "- 2000",
      "Holt was challenged by former Republican Congressman Dick Zimmer in the 2000 election . Holts prior win was thought by Republicans to be a fluke , and the race attracted considerable money and advertising . The election was hotly contested and the winner was not known on election day . Zimmer was ahead on election night by just a few votes , but Holt was ahead the next day . Ten days after the election , Holt declared himself the winner by 481 votes . Zimmer challenged the results , but conceded after the count began to go against him . Holt ultimately won the election by a margin of 651 votes : 146,162 votes for Holt ( 48.730% ) compared to Zimmers 145,511 ( 48.513% ) , making it the only general election where Holt has not received a majority of the votes in the election .

Foster is currently the only research physicist in the U.S . House of Representatives with the retirement of Ehlers , and Foster defeating Judy Biggert in 2012 to reenter the House . Holts supporters produced green bumper stickers reading My Congressman IS a rocket scientist! , reflecting his scientific background .",
      "Holt is one of two members of Congress to have participated on the American television game show Jeopardy! , the other being Senator John McCain of Arizona . Both appeared on the Fleming era of the television series with Holt winning five games . Holts official Congressional website mentioned his being a five-time winner , as did some of his campaign materials . On February 28 , 2011 , Holt participated in a non-televised exhibition Jeopardy ! match against the IBM computer Watson along with four other members of Congress ( Jim Himes , Nan Hayworth , Jared Polis and Bill Cassidy ) . Holt bested the computer $8,600 to $6,200 in a single-round match .",
      "As a Congressman , Holt maintained liberal viewpoints on several major issues , and consistently voted accordingly . For example , he supported abortion rights , opposed the privatization of Social Security , and supported a public health care option . Several of his legislative priorities included tax credits for small businesses , increasing access to a college education for middle-class families , maintaining Medicare and Social Security , and preserving the environment .",
      "In 2009 , the National Journal rated him as one of the eight most liberal members of the House of Representatives . Holts rankings released by various interest groups reflect his liberal views . Since 2009 , he has been rated 100 percent in accordance with the interests of the following interest groups , among others : American Public Health Association , Americans for Democratic America , and NARAL Pro-Choice America .",
      "Holt was a member of the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Progressive Caucus .

      "- Environment",
      "As a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources , Holt supported legislation to clean up the environment and cap greenhouse gas emissions , and he promoted the development and use of alternative energy sources . He reintroduced the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act in 2011 , co-sponsored the No New Drilling Act in 2012 to prevent new oil drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf , co-sponsored the Oceans Conservation , Education , and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act ( H.R . 21 ) , founded the Childrens Environmental Health Caucus to raise awareness about environmental issues pertaining to childrens health , and secured funding to preserve open space and recreation areas .",

On November 12 , 2012 , the New Jersey Sierra Club awarded Holt the Outstanding Achievement Award for his environmental conservation efforts .",
      "A September 2012 Nature article featured Holt and his rare background as a research scientist : [ Holt ] thinks what is equally important is having more scientific thinking , even among the non-scientists in government .. . [ Holt states ] , Im more interested in the way that scientists are trained to deal with uncertainty , to deal with evidence and statistical reasoning , things that are lacking in the political debate . When it comes to global warming , for instance , Representative Holt says we dont need people in Congress who understand atmospheric pressure , or glaciation . We simply need them to be open to the idea that evidence might disprove what they think they know . And that , he says , is thinking like a scientist .",
      "Discussing sciences role in policy and government , Holt points out a fallacy in the way people think about science : The ethic in the profession is that you stick to your science , and if youre interested in how science affects public policy or public questions , just let the facts speak for themselves . Of course , theres a fallacy there , too . Facts are , by themselves , voiceless .",
      "- Education",
      "Holt is a strong supporter of educational initiatives , but questions the ways in which science is taught . Our real problem is not that were failing to produce excellent scientists , because we are [ producing them ] , but rather that we have failed to maintain an appreciation for and understanding of science in the general population . He is concerned that science education since 1958 may have created a population that is largely disconnected from scientific thinking . We left behind about 80% of the population because we teach science in the schools primarily for future scientists . Holt emphasizes the importance to all citizens of empirically-based thinking :",
      "While co-chair of the Research and Development Caucus , a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor , and serving on the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century , Holt worked on crafting several comprehensive education policies . He helped write the College Cost Reduction Act - the largest college aid expansion bill since the GI bill - which drastically reduced student loan interest rates and included Holts provision to provide upfront tuition assistance for math , science , and foreign language teachers . He also helped establish the American Opportunity tax credit to alleviate the burden of college tuition for low- and moderate-income students . Furthermore , Holt helped enact the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act , which provides states with funding to reduce budget shortfalls and keep teachers in their classrooms .",
      "For his significant legislative work on and support for all education initiatives , but also for legislation to strengthen national security through expansion and improvement of foreign language study , and to increase foreign language capacity in the U.S . intelligence community and throughout the federal government by expanding education in critical need foreign languages , Holt received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in 2005 .",
      "On May 28 , 2010 , Holt voted in support of the Science and Technology Funding Bill ( H.R . 5116 ) , a bill passed in the House that provided funding for science and technology research and development purposes .",
      "Formerly the Assistant Director at Princeton Universitys Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory , Holt sought to promote involvement in programs of STEM fields . He successfully defended funding for the Department of Educations Mathematics and Science Partnerships programs . As a result of his efforts , he was repeatedly given an A rating by the National Education Association after 2007 , along with a 100 percent approval rating by the National Association for College Admission Counseling in 2006 and 2009\u20132011 .",
      "On January 22 , 2013 , Holt introduced a resolution designating February 12 , 2013 ( Charles Darwins 204th birthday ) , as Darwin Day in order to recognize the importance of sciences in the betterment of humanity .",
      "- Social issues",
      "On his website , Holt stated , Since coming to Congress , I have fought for fairness in health care coverage , worked to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault , supported equal pay for equal work , and sought gender equity in schools . While a Congressman , he strongly believed in womens right to make decisions about their health care , without interference by the government , and supported Roe v . Wade .",
      "Holt successfully opposed legislation that would have prevented access to birth control , eliminated funding for Title X ( the national family planning program ) , and denied federal funding to Planned Parenthood . Planned Parenthood and the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association consistently issued an approval rating of 100 percent for Holt beginning in 1995 , while the NARAL Pro-Choice America rated Holt 100 percent beginning in 1999 .",
      "Holt also sponsored the Helping Seniors Choose their Medicare Drug Plan Act ( H.R . 3152 ) , which increased the access that low-income healthcare recipients have to prescription drugs under Medicare and Medicaid . With the Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act ( H.R . 3835 ) , Holt attempted to regulate the removal of voters names from eligibility lists to ensure the validity of those lists . With the Judicious Use of Surveillance Tools in Counterterrorism Efforts ( JUSTICE ) Act of 2009 ( H.R . 4005 ) , Holt increased limits on governmental power with respect to counterterrorism efforts .",

      "The Numedal Line ( ) is a long railway line that runs up the Numedal valley between Kongsberg and R\u00f8dberg in Viken county , Norway . Built and operated by the Norwegian State Railways , the non-electrified , standard gauge line passes through the municipalities of Kongsberg , Flesberg , Rollag and Nore og Uvdal . It is now owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration .",
      "The first plans for a line through Numedal were launched after the S\u00f8rland Line reached in Kongsberg in 1871 . After it was decided that the Bergen Line would instead follow Hallingdal , the Numedal plans lay dead until it was decided that a railway was necessary to build two hydroelectric power stations near R\u00f8dberg . The plans were passed in 1918 , the first trains started running in 1924 and the line was officially opened in 1927 . At first all services were provided with steam locomotives , but from the 1930s diesel multiple units were used for passenger trains . The line was frequented with classes Cmd 16 , 86 , 87 and 91 . The last regular train ran in 1988 ; since , there has been sporadic freight service and some heritage trains running from Kongsberg to Rollag . Draisine rental is available on the section from Veggli to R\u00f8dberg .",
      "In 2013 , Jernbaneverket reopened a 30km stretch between Kongsberg and Flesberg , to support the forestry industry . Following a derailment in April 2014 , the entire stretch was upgraded with new sleepers .",
      "Route .",
      "The Numedal Line branches off from the S\u00f8rland Line at Kongsberg Station , which is located from Oslo Central Station and above mean sea level ( AMSL ) . The line runs past four stops , Spiten , Pikerfoss , Gleda and Herbru , before reaching a branch to Svene Gravel Pit , from Kongsberg . The line continues past the halts Ramsrud , Svene , Furuly and Toresplassen before reaching Lampeland Station , from Kongsberg . The line then passes over Lyngdalselva on a bridge and continues past the stops Fl\u00f8tterud , Ruud , Vangestad and Eie before reaching the branch to the sawmill Numedal Bruk , from Kongsberg , which is located just south of Flesberg Station .",
      "The line continues past the stops Bj\u00f8rnsrud , Bakkerud and Fossan before reaching the Helle Tunnel and then Djupdal Station after Kongsberg . The line then runs through the Ulvik Tunnel and the Gygrestigen Tunnel . It then passes the halt Selsteigen before running through the Selsteigen Tunnel . After passing through the halt Kjome , the line reaches Rollag Station , which is from Kongsberg . Since 1989 , this is the furthest north the line is kept operational , although the track remains all the way to R\u00f8dberg .",
      "The line continues past the stops Tr\u00e5en , Rollag kirke , Br\u00e5ten , Sjors\u00e5te , over the Bruhaug Bridge , past the stops Laugi , Vamre , Risteigen and then passes over the river Veggli elv on a bridge . At after Kongsberg the line reaches Veggli Station , before continuing past the stops Tveitk\u00e5sa , Kjerre , Fossebrekke and then through two tunnels , Gjeiteryggen I and Gjeiteryggen II , which are and long , respectively . The line then passes by the stops Kravikfjord , Kittelsland , Eidsstrykken , a bridge over Eids\u00e5a , the stops Norefjord , Svendsrud and the Rundberg Tunnel . The line then runs past the stop Midtstigen and S\u00f8ndre Sandnes before running through five tunnels , named Sandnes I and II , Vrennedalen I and II , and Bondeberg , which are between long . Just before Gvammen Station , which is from Kongsberg , there is a branch to Nore II Power Station .",
      "The line then runs through six tunnels , named Gvams\u00e5s I through V , and Hvilsten . These are between long . The line then passes past R\u00f8dberg vokterbolig , which is form Kongsberg and is , at AMSL the highest point on the line . The line then passes over Uvdalselva on a combined road and rail bridge , before reaching R\u00f8dberg , from Kongsberg .",
      "History .",
      "With the construction of the S\u00f8rland Line to Kongsberg , which opened on 10 November 1871 , proposals were launched to extend the line up Numedal . On 16 August 1873 , a meeting was held between representatives from the municipalities in Numedal to discuss how they could convince national politicians to build the Bergen Line through Numedal . However , instead the Bergen Line was decided to run through Hallingdal . What finally spurred the construction was the construction of hydroelectric power stations in the valley . In 1907 , the government , through its power agency , had secured rights to build a power station in the rivers Numedalsl\u00e5gen and Tunnhovdfjorden . The state saw it as advantageous to build a railway through the valley to aid construction of Nore I and Nore II Power Station , despite the line not being on the railway plan . This was because machines weighing up to would have to be transported up the valley . The initial estimates for the line was a cost of 8.3 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) .",
      "On 3 August 1918 , the line was passed by the Parliament of Norway and it was decided that the line was to be built with standard gauge , which by then had become the norm . The decision was controversial , as the line was expected to have little traffic and would therefore not be profitable . A minority of the parliamentarians instead wanted the line to be built with narrow gauge to reduce construction costs . The state required that local municipalities and counties contributed to some of the investment costs . NOK 1.2 million was paid by Buskerud County Municipality , while NOK 2.17 million million was paid by the various municipalities . The largest amounts were paid by Flesberg with NOK 635,000 , Nore with NOK 615,000 and Rollag with NOK 517,000 , while Uvdal paid NOK 198,000 , Kongsberg NOK 125,000 and Drammen NOK 80,000 .",
      "Siting commenced in 1918 , and by 1919 , an administration for the works had been established in Kongsberg . Construction commenced on 2 July 1920 , between Fossan and Bratterud . However , there quickly arose a strike , resulting in construction not being taken up until March 1921 . Final approval by parliament was first made on 20 July 1921 . Most of the construction was done using hand tools . of earth was moved , of rock was blasted and of tunnel were built . of ballast stone were used , most of it from the gravel pits at Bevergrenda , Guribr\u00e5ten and Stevningsmogen , Tjuvhaugen and Skarpsmoen . The whole construction used seven million work hours and for the tunneling , each work hour gave of progress . Most of the tracks were used from other railways . Five of the station buildings , at Vangestad , Flesberg , Djupdal , Tr\u00e5en and Kravikfjord , were workmens sheds which had been placed on a foundation .",
      "From 1924 , the railway was taken partially into use . Trains could run the from Kongsberg to Bakker\u00f8d from 15 November 1924 , the to Kj\u00e6rre from 1 December 1925 and to R\u00f8dberg from 1 December 1926 . These trains included transport of of cement and for the railway bridges . In total 4,300 wagon loads were transported before the official opening , of which about half was for the power stations . Because of the delay of building the line , it could only be used during part of the construction period for the power stations .",
      "The official opening took place on 19 November 1927 by King Haakon VII . When the line opened there were 21 manned station on the line . Up to 70 people worked on the line , in addition to station employees . In 1932 , the operations were rationalized , cutting costs from NOK 426,000 to NOK 310,000 per year . This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and replacing them with a clerk .",
      "Initially , all trains on the line were hauled by steam locomotives , in particular NSB Class 20 and NSB Class 21 brought in used from other lines . The first diesel multiple units were taken into use in the 1930s , with the line seeing the use of both NSB Class Cmb 16 and Kristine Valdresdatter . During World War II , the line was again entirely hauled by steam locomotives and the service was reduced considerably . By 1945 , there were three round trips per week , but after the war ended , the frequency increased and by 1947 there were four daily round trips . Various classes of multiple units have been used , including NSB Class 86 , NSB Class 87 and NSB Class 91 . During the 1950s , there were sometimes also trains that operated just from Kongsberg to Veggli .",
      "Because the conductors and engineers often knew where the locals lived or were headed , trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk . In the 1960s , the number of round trips was reduced to three per day , allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit . NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970 , when NSBs last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg . For a short period during the 1980s , there were also school trains , but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line , it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus .",
      "Discussion about closing the line started in the 1950s , and the line became a candidate every time NSB and the parliament discussed closures . In 1988 , the parliament decided to close many Norwegian lines , including the Numedal Line , although it was decided that the section from Kongsberg to Rollag was to be kept for freight traffic . The last passenger train operated on 31 December 1988 and the line north of Rollag was officially closed on 1 January 1989 . By the time the line closed in 1989 , manning remained at only three stations : Flesberg , Veggli and R\u00f8dberg . NSB retained some traffic south of Flesberg ; in 1993 the company hauled of gravel and of lumber along the line .",
      "After the closure , the non-profit organization Friends of the Numedal Line was established and offered occasional heritage rides along the line . It maintains the tracks between Rollag and R\u00f8dberg and offers draisine rental between Veggli and R\u00f8dberg . Irregular transport from the gravel pit at Svene and the sawmill Numedal Bruk at Flesberg . The latter is operated by T\u00e5g\u00e5keriet i Bergslagen and hauls lumber from Uddevalla , Sweden . The stretch from Flesberg to R\u00f8dberg is suggested preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage ."

At Landmark , Levin served as director of legal policy and the foundations Washington-based Center for Civil Rights before becoming president in 1997 . Under Levins presidency , Landmark Legal filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in 2000 alleging that the National Education Association , the largest teachers union in the U.S. , did not disclose spending on political activity in Internal Revenue Service documentation . Landmark Legal also filed similar complaints with the United States Department of Labor in 2002 regarding NEA and political activity ; by 2006 , the NEA and smaller American Federation of Teachers had filed new documents with the Labor Department revealing over $100 million combined in political action spending .",
      "Following Freedom of Information Act requests in August 2012 of documents that would show if Environmental Protection Agency officials sought to delay regulations until after the 2012 presidential election , federal judge Royce Lamberth ruled in 2015 that although Landmark Legal did not establish that the EPA acted in bad faith , the EPA either carelessly or intentionally neglected Landmarks FOIA request . Lamberth previously ruled in 2013 that the EPA might have attempted to evade Landmarks FOIA request .",
      "In 2001 the American Conservative Union awarded Levin its Ronald Reagan Award for his work with Landmark Legal .",
      "Politico reported in 2014 that Levin received a salary of more than $300,000 per year as president of the non-profit Landmark Legal Foundation , whose donors include the Sarah Scaife Foundation , the Charles G .

      "Writer .",
      "Levin wrote the 2005 book Men In Black : How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America , in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court ( from all parts of the political spectrum ) have legislated from the bench . Commentary magazines Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers to identify with originalists who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers , and to reject the activists who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own desired outcomes . Slate magazines Dahlia Lithwick wrote that no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution , on the ideological left or right , is going to waste their time engaging Levins arguments once theyve read this book .",
      "is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter .",
      "Liberty and Tyranny : A Conservative Manifesto was released in 2009 , and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks , as well as No . 1 on Nielsen BookScan and No . 2 on Amazon.coms list of bestselling books of 2009 . The book includes discussion of issues Levin believes need to be addressed in the United States . In Liberty and Tyranny Levin repudiates the use of the term progressive to describe modern Liberals and instead argues a proper term should be Statist . Liberty and Tyranny has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions , the books publisher . Andrew C . McCarthy , in The New Criterion , wrote , Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack against Americas Leftist ascendancy . Other reviewers critiqued the book as analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape while opining that Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism .",
      "Ameritopia : The Unmaking of America was issued in 2012 . In Ameritopia , Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies , the latter of which he refers to as statist , through the works of some of the leading figures in American history . Included are commentaries on works by Plato , Sir Thomas More , Thomas Hobbes , Karl Marx , John Locke , Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville . Conor Friedersdorfs review , published in The Atlantic , criticized the texts argument that statism is based on utopianism , and Carlin Romano , in The Chronicle of Higher Education , wrote that Ameritopia is really Ameritastrophe . Its disastrously bad from beginning to end .",
      "In Levins 2013 book he suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments . The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list . Hans A . von Spakovsky of National Review Online called the book required reading for conservative bloggers . Ana Marie Cox , writing in The Guardian , said the book contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution , but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project while noting the ludicrousness of his specific fixes and the near-impossibility of achieving them . Also in The Washington Times , Richard W . Rahn wrote , If The Liberty Amendments can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions , including constitutional amendments , are needed to increase liberty and prosperity , Mr . Levin will have performed a great national service . Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levins book used weak arguments .",
      "Levins Plunder and Deceit : Big Governments Exploitation of Young People and the Future was published in 2015 , and Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism in 2017 .",
      "Levins Unfreedom of the Press , which was released on May 21 , 2019 , became the number one best-selling book on Amazon.com three days before its official release , as a result of pre-order sales . Unfreedom of the Press also became a New York Times #1 best-seller on June 6 , 2019 , in the combined print & e-book nonfiction and hardcover nonfiction categories . Lloyd Green was critical of the book in The Guardian writing that the book is not exactly fan fiction but it can get ahead of itself when discussing the special counsels conclusions , ending up sounding like the fake news the author and Trump both purport to abhor . Annalisa Quinn , writing for NPR , stated : the book is largely filler . Quotations and paraphrasing make up the majority of the books central chapters . Lengthy and irrelevant block quotes from historians about , say , colonial printing practices.. . give the book the air of a padded student essay . Quinn also wrote , [ Levin ] conducts no interviews , presents no original research , and visits no newsrooms , and When Levin does offer his own analysis , it can approach parody . On June 8 , 2019 , Levin appeared on C-SPAN2s Book TV to discuss Unfreedom of the Press , in which he argued that the press has lowered its standards in providing objective and trustworthy journalism .",
      "Political views .",
      "A 2016 study which sought to measure incendiary discourse on talk radio and TV found that Levin scored highest on its measure of outrage . The study looked at 10 prominent radio and television programs , known for incendiary discourse on political matters , and scored content on the basis of whether it used emotional display , misrepresentative exaggeration , mockery , conflagration , slippery slope , insulting or obscene language , and other factors , finding that Levin was the radio host who engaged in the most outrage . The study found that he utilized outrage speech or behavior at a rate of more than one instance per minute . In How Democracies Die , Harvard University political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky write that Mark Levin was among the popular right-wing talk radio hosts who helped to legitimate the use of uncivil discourse in American politics , and contribute to the erosion of democratic norms . According to Politico , Levin has a penchant for hysteria .",
      "Views on politicians and other individuals .",
      "According to The Guardian , constant attacks on Democrats and the left are important components of Levins modus operandi . According to Politico in May 2009 , Levin pronounced almost daily that Obama was a failure , a liar , and a statist who is trying to destroy individual freedom . In June 2017 , Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being a radical Marxist who believes in violence . According to Rutgers University political scientist Stephen Eric Bronner , Levin tends to use socialism as a catch-all term to condemn any policy that strengthens the social welfare function of the state . In July 2014 , he called Jon Stewart a knee-jerk idiot , and suggested that Stewart was a self-hating Jew . He has stated that Nancy Pelosis politics comes as close to a form of modern-day fascism as Ive ever seen . In January 2019 , he said Pelosi was Americas first fascist . And thats a fact . Levin said the new Congressional Speaker had hijacked the federal government by deciding to block the financing of President Trumps border wall . Levin has also mocked how Pelosi looks , referred to Beto ORourke as a weak man , and called Dick Blumenthal a pathetic , loathsome liar .",
      "He has criticized Republicans \u2013 including Paul Ryan , Lindsey Graham , John McCain , and Mitch McConnell \u2013 with whom he disagrees . He sometimes refers to such individuals as RINOs . Levin endorsed Orrin Hatch when he faced a primary challenge in 2012 , but later apologized for his endorsement when Hatch said that he would be willing to support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants . Since then , he endorsed a number of Republican primary challengers to incumbent Republican senators . Levin supported the Tea Party Patriots campaign to fire House Speaker John Boehner . Earlier in 2010 , Levin criticized Glenn Beck for his criticism of congressional Republicans . He has referred to Mitt Romney as an ass and called CNN host Brian Stelter a creep .",
      "Levin supported U.S . Representative Mo Brooks in his campaign in the 2017 Alabama special election against incumbent Luther Strange , who had received a temporary appointment earlier that year .",
      "Levin strongly defended former EPA head Scott Pruitt while he was under a dozen separate ethics investigations . Levin said Pruitts policies on the whole have been outstanding , and I dont throw good people under the bus because the left targets them .",
      "Sponsorship and conflicts of interest .",
      "During the 2012 election cycle , Levins show was paid at least $757,000 in sponsorship by the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity to run ads for the group , a deal which began in the summer of 2010 . After the sponsorship ended , Levin began making ads for the Tea Party Patriots . The Senate Conservatives Fund paid Simon & Schuster at least $427,000 for copies of Levins Liberty or Tyranny in September and October 2013 . During the same period , on his radio show and Facebook page , Levin frequently promoted the group , which has funded primary challengers of Senate Republicans . Levin did not disclose that the group had made $427,000 of purchases of his book .",
      "Levin endorsed Orrin Hatch when Levin was being sponsored by Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) which also endorsed Hatch . Levin withdrew his endorsement of Hatch when Levin was being sponsored by the Tea Party Patriots . Levin dismissed the allegations that he engages in pay-to-play .",
      "President Obama .",
      "In 2009 , Levin described as absolutely right the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care . In 2011 , a caller to Levins show , claiming to be a neurosurgeon , said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments . Levin said to the caller , so Sarah Palin was right . The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false . In late 2013 , Levin said there were similarities between a gathering of hand-picked supporters of the Affordable Care Act chosen by the Obama administration to Nazi Sturmabteilung or Brownshirts drawing comparisons of the propaganda techniques of the two groups .",
      "Levin stated in 2013 that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government and described President Obama as a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer . He speculated in November 2014 that , after the 2014 mid-term elections , Obama might go full Mussolini .",
      "In February 2015 , Levin stated that President Obama was seeking to destroy Israel because Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism . He blamed Obama for the Ebola crisis : the political policies of this administration which opens the door wide to people from the poorest parts of the world . We dont know who they are , we dont know if they have diseases .",
      "WMDs in Iraq .",
      "In 2014 , Levin claimed that the Bush administrations original WMD rationale for the Iraq War had been vindicated by citing reports of U.S . soldiers in Iraq that were wounded by the decayed remnants of Saddam Husseins chemical weapons arsenal . The remnants in question were degraded and unusable chemical weapons shells from the 1980s . Levin faulted the Bush administration for not doing more to publicize these remnants of Iraqs former WMD program .",
      "Donald Trump .",
      "In March 2016 , Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination . Over a month after Donald Trump was nominated , in September 2016 , Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Trump in the presidential election , following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the Never Trump camp and would never vote for Trump . He qualified his support by stating : I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say .",
      "Wiretap claim .",
      "In March 2017 , Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used police state surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election . The Associated Press said that Levin voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower . Levin protested the AP report vigorously , demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers . His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and reportedly became the basis of President Trumps unfounded Trump Tower wiretapping allegations . In September 2017 , reports emerged of a court-ordered Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) wiretap on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort ; while certain Trump supporters alleged that this surveillance vindicated Levin and Trumps unsupported assertions , The Atlantic commented : This is not true \u2013 Trump claimed he had been the subject of Obama-ordered , politically motivated surveillance , for which there remains no evidence .",
      "Deep State conspiracy theories .",
      "Levin has said that there is a coup occurring against the presidency of Donald Trump waged by Obama loyalists . Levins coup claim was referring to investigations of the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and of alleged obstruction of justice by Trump . He has suggested that former FBI Director James Comey used the Trump-Russia dossier to blackmail the president . He has claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller engaged in a Deep State coup against Trump .",
      "In February 2018 , Levin said the Nunes Memo shows Hillary Clinton paid for a warrant and Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians...it appears the FBI at the senior-most levels colluded with the Russians too .",
      "In August 2018 , Levin stated that Mueller is a greater threat to this Republic and Constitution than anything Vladimir Putin did during the [ 2016 ] campaign . When the Attorney General Bill Barr issued his summary of Muellers Special Counsel report considering Russian interference in the 2016 election , Levin called the second volume of the report crap . Of the prosecutor he suggested : Who gives a damn what the prosecutor said ? He insisted the special counsel was not God . He is not a judge . He is not a jury !",
      "Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal .",
      "After President Trump pressed the President of Ukraine to start an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son , Levin strongly defended Trumps actions . Asked on Fox & Friends whether Levin was okay with Trump asking a foreign leader for dirt on Biden , Levin lashed out at the Fox & Friends host and repeatedly shouted there was no problem with what Trump did . Shortly thereafter , Trump praised Levin and retweeted more than 20 tweets by viewers praising Levin . Levin also accused Joe Biden of being the one who did something illegal , though he did not provide evidence or any elaboration .",
      "In October 2019 , while Trump was the subject of the impeachment inquiry , Levin said that on his Blaze TV show : While hes been president there hasnt even been a hint of scandal . Not a hint ! He was highly critical of Mitt Romney who increased his criticisms of President Trump during this period.<ref",
      "2020 election .",
      "Following the 2020 presidential election as all significant media organizations reported Joe Biden had won , Levin told his radio audience , the Democrats were stealing the election . He insisted on Twitter to his 2.4 million followers : theres lots of evidence of voter fraud and election screw-ups . On the same platform on November 5 , Levin called on Republican-controlled state legislatures to disregard the results of the 2020 election and send electors to the Electoral College who would vote for Trump . The suggestion was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr .",
      "He praised Sidney Powell , a member of Trumps legal team , for what he considered to be her patriotism after she promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and sought to overturn election results . He frequently had guests on his show who led the audience to think Joe Bidens win in the presidential election could be overturned .",
      "On January 5 , 2021 , Levin insisted Congresss imminent counting of the Electoral College votes was an act of tyranny because of the supposed fraud . He told his listeners , If we dont fight on Jan . 6 on the floor of the Senate and the House.. . then we are done . Following the next days storming of the Capitol in Washington , he continued in the same vein . It appears nothing has changed in 24 hours.. . Not a damn thing . The never-Trumpers , the RINOs , the media \u2014 same damn thing , although he was critical of the rioters . Meanwhile , on the same day as the riot , Cumulus Media circulated a memo instructing its presenters , a roster which includes Levin , to cease implying the 2021 presidential election was stolen or face the end of the right to broadcast via Cumulus .",
      "COVID-19 pandemic .",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic , Levin downplayed the threat of the virus , arguing that the media was overreacting and that the death toll from the flu was lower than the coronavirus .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Levin suffered a heart attack in 2000 and had open heart surgery .",
      "He was married to Kendall Levin and they divorced . He is currently married to Julie Prince .",

      "Peter Beattie",
      "Peter Douglas Beattie ( born 18 November 1952 ) is a former Australian politician who served as the 36th Premier of Queensland , in office from 1998 to 2007 . He was the state leader of the Labor Party from 1996 to 2007 .",
      "Beattie was born in Sydney but grew up in Atherton , Queensland . He worked as a lawyer , union secretary and ALP State Secretary before entering politics . Beattie was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the 1989 state election . He served as a Health Minister from 1995 to 1996 under Wayne Goss , and then replaced Goss as party leader following a change in government . As leader of the opposition , Beattie led the Labor Party back to power at the 1998 election , and won further victories at the 2001 , 2004 and 2006 elections . He retired in 2007 and was succeeded by his deputy Anna Bligh .",
      "After retiring as Premier , Beattie was appointed to a series of corporate government and academic boards and held numerous academic roles . He made an unsuccessful attempt to enter federal politics at the 2013 election , standing in the Division of Forde . In 2016 , Beattie was made chairman of the organising committee for the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast . He was appointed a Commissioner of the Australian Rugby League Commission in July , 2017 and Chair in February 2018 and Deputy Chair of the Rugby League International Federation ( RLIF ) in November , 2018 . Beattie joined the board of the Medical research Commercialisation Fund in July 2010 and became Chair in July , 2019 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Beattie was born in Sydney as the youngest of seven children . Following the death of his mother when he was four years old , he was raised by his grandmother at Atherton , a small town in North Queensland , and attended Atherton State High School where he was both Dux and School Captain . He moved to Brisbane to attend the University of Queensland after winning a Commonwealth Scholarship , graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Laws degree . He was President of the Student Club at St Johns College . He completed a Master of Arts degree from Queensland University of Technology , and then began practising as a lawyer .",
      "Prior to his election to parliament , Beattie was a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland and secretary of the Railway Station Officers Union .",
      "Pre-parliamentary career .",
      "In 1974 , he joined the Australian Labor Party , which had been in opposition for 17 years and had just suffered the worst defeat in its history at the hands of the dominant National Party Premier , Joh Bjelke-Petersen .",
      "In the 1980 federal election , Beattie was the Labor candidate for the federal Division of Ryan and was defeated by the Liberal incumbent John Moore , but achieving a 3 per cent two-party preferred swing in the process . He only nominated for Ryan to give him the right to appeal to the National Executive of the ALP from a six-month suspension from the Queensland ALP for criticising the state parliamentary party for incompetence .",
      "Beattie started a Reform Group within the ALP led by Dr Denis Murphy and himself to reform the Queensland branch of the party , which was dominated by elderly and conservative trade union leaders . In 1981 the federal Labor Party leader , Bill Hayden ( himself a Queenslander ) , led a federal intervention in Queensland , and Beattie became Queensland State Secretary . Eight years later these reforms paved the way for the election of Wayne Goss when he became Queenslands first Labor Premier since Vince Gair in 1957 .",
      "Early parliamentary career ( 1989-1996 ) .",
      "At the 1989 election Beattie was elected to the Queensland Parliament as MP for Brisbane Central . Something of a maverick within the parliamentary party during his early term , Beattie was opposed by old guard faction leaders and kept out of the ministry for his role as Parliamentary Chair of the Criminal Justice Committee . His main post was as chairman of the parliamentary committee overseeing the Criminal Justice Commission ( now the Crime and Corruption Commission ) , a role in which he frequently took an independent stand against improper behaviour by supporting the CJC Commissioner Sir Max Bingham against the Goss government , earning Gosss ire . Beattie also publicly criticised Goss for being out of touch . As a result , Goss did not appoint him to the ministry until Labors near defeat at the 1995 election , where Beattie became Minister for Health . He was only in office for six months before the Goss government lost office following defeat in the Mundingburra by-election .",
      "Goss then stood down as ALP leader , and Beattie was elected in his stead unopposed , thus becoming Opposition Leader . His first act as Opposition leader was a tactical one , moving a motion in Parliament preventing the new Coalition government under Rob Borbidge from calling an early election . Labor was unpopular at the time and feared that an early election could give the Coalition an outright majority . The motion carried .",
      "Premier ( 1998-2007 ) .",
      "At the 1998 state election , Labor won 44 seats out of 89 , and was only denied a majority when One Nation won six seats that otherwise would have gone to Labor if not for leakage of Coalition preferences . The balance of power rested with two independents , Peter Wellington and Liz Cunningham , and the 11 One Nation MPs . Labor needed the support of only one crossbencher to make Beattie premier , while the Coalition needed them all for Borbidge to stay in office . After negotiations with Beattie , Wellington announced his support for Labor , allowing Beattie to form a minority government . Beattie said the ALP would govern as if it had a majority of ten .",
      "A few months later , Charles Rappolt , the One Nation member for Mulgrave , abruptly resigned . Labors Warren Pitt , who had held the seat from 1989 to 1995 , won the ensuing by-election , giving Beattie a majority in his own right . Pitt would have retaken his old seat a few months earlier , if not for Coalition preferences leaking to Rappolt .",
      "Shortly before the 2001 election , he faced a crisis when a CJC inquiry - the Shepherdson inquiry - revealed that a number of MPs and party activists , including Deputy Premier Jim Elder , had been engaged in breaches of the Electoral Act by falsely enrolling people to boost their factions strength in internal party ballots . As well as a former State Secretary and newly elected MP Mike Kaiser , and a senior adviser to Wayne Goss had been falsely enrolled some years earlier as part of a factional battle . Beattie acted swiftly , forcing a number of MPs to quit politics and to leave the ALP . In the ensuing campaign , Beattie claimed a Labor win would ensure stable government . He argued the only alternative was a Coalition government propped up by One Nation and former One Nation MPs\u2014an argument that gained particular resonance when Borbidges own party room reneged on Borbidges promise not to preference One Nation . Beattie was rewarded with a smashing victory , winning 66 seats out of 89\u2014the biggest majority Labor has ever won in an election . It also took all but one seat in Brisbane . The Liberal Party ended up with only three seats in parliament .",
      "Beatties key agenda was to transform Queensland into Australias Smart State by restructuring the economy and reforming the education system , skilling the workforce and encouraging innovation , research and development and high tech biotechnology , information technology and aviation industries to locate in Queensland including Virgin airlines . In 2003 , the Premier was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Queensland in recognition of his leadership and commitment to higher education through Smart State initiatives and his support for research in the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology .",
      "2004 state election .",
      "Beatties government drove an innovation agenda in new industries which reduced Queenslands unemployment level below its target of 5% . In February 2004 Beattie again went to the polls but a crisis blew up shortly before the election , with a highly critical report on the state of Queenslands system of child protection . Beattie accepted full personal responsibility for the issue , and paradoxically turned the issue into a positive for the government . At the 7 February elections Beattie won 63 seats , a net loss of only three , losing four seats to the National-Liberal Opposition but gaining one from them . This made him one of the most successful state politicians in Australian history .",
      "2005/2006 Queensland Health crisis .",
      "Having delivered on his Smart State Strategy , the Beattie government was riding high in public support . However , in the latter part of 2005 , Beattie faced potentially his most serious political crisis : the revelations and inquiries into Queensland Health and the Bundaberg public hospital after Jayant Patel , an Indian-born surgeon who performed several botched operations , some of which resulted in death , fled the country to the United States , where he had previously been struck off the register . As was his style , Beattie faced the crisis head on . Amid the controversy and evidence at an Inquiry established by the Beattie government , the health minister Gordon Nuttall resigned his portfolio , the Speaker , Ray Hollis , resigned after controversy associated with his use of Parliamentary expenditure , and the Deputy Premier and Treasurer , Terry Mackenroth , retired , forcing by-elections in the safe Labor seats of Redcliffe and Chatsworth on 20 August . Labor suffered major swings against it and both seats were lost to the Liberal Party , the first serious electoral setback for Beattie since becoming Premier .",
      "Following the retirement of the Premier of New South Wales , Bob Carr in 2005 , Beattie became the longest-serving state Premier among his contemporaries .",
      "2006 state election .",
      "Beattie went on to win the September 2006 election convincingly in a third landslide , with a slight swing towards the ALP in terms of its primary vote , and two party preferred result . The Government even won back the two seats of Redcliffe and Chatsworth it had lost in the recent by elections . Coalition Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg stepped down . Before the election Liberal Leader Bob Quinn was forced by his party colleagues to step down a fortnight before polling day . The campaign of Quinns replacement Dr Bruce Flegg was characterized by inexperience and indecisiveness and lacked an organised , professional approach . Premier Beattie therefore was never challenged by the opposition and was able to secure a fourth consecutive term in office with another landslide victory . This result puts Beattie in the realm of iconic political figures . He is the only state Labor leader since Neville Wran , NSW Labor Premier from 1976 to 1986 , to do so and is Queenslands fourth longest serving Premier after Labors William Forgan Smith ( 1932\u20131942 ) , the Country Partys Frank Nicklin ( 1957\u20131968 ) and National Party Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen ( 1968\u20131987 ) .",
      "Retirement .",
      "Beattie announced on 10 September 2007 his decision to retire from politics . His resignation as Premier officially took effect on 13 September 2007 . At the time of his retirement , he was the longest-serving state premier in the country . Beattie had groomed his deputy Anna Bligh to be his successor for some time and the Labor caucus elected Anna Bligh as its leader on 12 September . In 2009 , Anna Bligh led her party to a state election victory , thereby becoming the first Australian female to be popularly elected as state premier in Queensland .",
      "He officially stood down as the Member for Brisbane Central on 14 September 2007 . Beattie then served as Queenslands Trade Commissioner to North and South America based in Los Angeles , a position he was appointed to by Anna Bligh in March 2008 .",
      "In late May 2010 Beattie announced that he was retiring from his position as Queenslands Los Angeles-based trade and investment commissioner . to take up an appointment in the US . In June 2010 it was announced that he had accepted a position with Clemson University in South Carolina . On 24 August 2011 , the Gillard Government appointed Beattie as Australias first Resources Sector Supplier Envoy charged with promoting a Buy Australian at Home and Abroad program for supplying products to the Australian resources industry .",
      "Federal politics .",
      "Beatties popularity often led to speculation that he would enter national politics , particularly after federal Labors defeat at the 2001 federal election . But Beattie resisted such suggestions , saying that he loved Queensland too much to leave , and anyway Canberra was too cold . On announcing his retirement he again ruled out a move to federal politics , saying that he would , politically speaking , disappear .",
      "However , in August 2013 , Beattie announced his intention to run in the 2013 federal election in the Queensland federal seat of Forde following an approach by Prime Minister Rudd to Beattie who was then living in New York . The ALP was in electoral trouble and Beattie was convinced to run to save Queensland seats . Following the ALPs disastrous national campaign , Beattie was defeated by incumbent Liberal National Party MP Bert van Manen .",
      "Media involvement .",
      "Beatties description by Liberal Leader Dr David Watson as a media tart as well as his political successes have led to a love-hate relationship with The Courier-Mail , Brisbanes daily newspaper . Columnist Peter Wear , for example , ran a long-running satire on Queensland politics in general with the major role played by President for Life Mbeattie .",
      "The controversy over the performance of the government-owned electricity supplier Energex during the severe 2003-2004 storm season in South East Queensland resulted in the characterisation of Beattie as Power Point Pete by Courier-Mail cartoonist Sean Leahy , with the location of the drawings eyes and nose designed to replicate the holes of a power point .",
      "In August 2007 the Beattie government proposed to reduce the number of councils from 154 to 72 , which would result in the merger of a number of regional and extra-metropolitan councils into larger Regional Councils . This proved particularly unpopular in the affected Councils as several hundred local politicians lost their positions .",
      "Autobiography .",
      "In May 2005 Beattie released his autobiography Making A Difference , in which he described his upbringing , political life and his views on key issues , including health , education and social reform . The book is part memoir , part manifesto . Beattie says that the reason he released the book while he is in office , rather than when he is retired , is because no-one would want to read about him if he was not in the public arena . It was Beatties third book after his autobiographical piece In the Arena ( 1990 ) and the thriller The Year of the Dangerous Ones . Beattie wrote a fourth book Where to from here Australia ? published in 2016",
      "Political commentator .",
      "Beattie joined Sky News Live as a commentator across multiple programs in February 2015 . Beattie began co-hosting his own TV program with Peter Reith in April 2016 which continued with former Queensland Premier Campbell Newman in 2017 until May , 2018 when Beattie retired from Sky News to focus on his position of Chair of the ARLC . Beattie was a regular political election commentator on Channels 9 and 7 from 2007 to 2015 and a regular Columnists for The Australian Newspaper from 2010 to 2015 .",
      "Sporting interests .",
      "In May 2016 , Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk appointed Beattie chairman of the challenged Gold Coast Commonwealth Games Corporation , the organising committee for the 2018 Commonwealth Games . It was criticised by the Queensland Opposition as a political appointment but well received by the Commonwealth Games Federation . The Games were highly successful and regarded as the best games ever , however , organisers received criticism after broadcasters failed to show footage of the athletes entering the stadium for the closing ceremony , broadcasting My Kitchen Rules instead . To avoid any blame games Beattie accepted responsibility , publicly apologised and described it as clearly a stuff-up .",
      "Beattie was appointed to the board of the Australian Rugby League Commission ( ARLC ) on 25 July 2017 , as an independent commissioner . In February 2018 , he was appointed chairman of the commission in place of John Grant . He is a supporter of reforming the organisations constitution to give National Rugby League ( NRL ) teams and state organisations direct representation on the board . As Chair of the ARLC , Beattie brought in major reforms including a new No Fault stand down rule for players charged with serious offences and ended the battles between the ARLC and the Clubs . He is also a strong supporter of the Magic Round pioneered in Brisbane in May , 2019 and expanding Womens rugby league and rugby league in PNG , Fiji and the Pacific Nations .",
      "Honours .",
      "On 1 January 2001 , Beattie was awarded the Centenary Medal for his contribution to Queensland . On 11 June 2012 , Beattie was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for eminent service to the Parliament and community of Queensland , through initiatives in the area of education and training , economic development , particularly in biotechnology , information technology and aviation industries , and to the promotion of international trade. . Beattie has been awarded five Honourary Doctorates from The University of Queensland , Griffith University , QUT , Bond University and in the US an honorary Doctor of Laws from University of South Carolina . Beattie won the first Biotechnology Industry Organisations inaugural International Award for Leadership Excellence in 2008 .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Peter is married to Dr Heather Beattie , a former professor of nursing . She was briefly involved in Brisbane City Council politics in her own capacity in 2012 . The Beatties have three adult children , Larissa , Denis and Matthew Beattie . Peter is an Anglican , and his wife is the daughter of an Anglican clergyman .",

      "The Fifer",
      "The Fifer or Young Flautist is a painting by French painter \u00c9douard Manet , made in 1866 . It is usually kept in the Mus\u00e9e dOrsay , Paris .",
      "History .",
      "On a trip to Spain in 1865 , \u00c9douard Manet visited the Prado , where the art of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was a revelation . Upon his return to Paris in 1866 , he began work on a new painting , depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army . In this picture , Manet presents the uniformed boy , in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of V\u00e9lazquezs court portraits , against a barely inflected , flattened background of neutral tone , thus frustrating attempts to assess the figures true size and , by extension , importance .",
      "The painting , entitled Le fifre , was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866 . Outraged by the jurys decision , \u00c9mile Zola , an early champion of Manets art , published a series of articles in the newspaper L\u00c9venement , that praised Manets realist style and modern content . Following the example of Gustave Courbet , in May 1867 , Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the \u00c9xposition universelle . The exhibition included Le fifre , which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting .",
      "The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893 . Between 1873 and 1893 , the painting was owned by Manets friend , composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure . It was included in a large exhibition of Manets work in 1884 , a year after his premature death .",
      "Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner , the Count Isaac de Camondo , and entered the national collections in 1911 . It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947 , when it was relocated to the Mus\u00e9e du Jeu de Paume . It was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983 , the 100th anniversary of the artists death .",
      "In 1986 , it was moved to its current home in the Mus\u00e9e dOrsay , the national museum of 19th-century art . It has since traveled in exposition ; for example , in 2017 and 2018 it was on loan to the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum in Abu Dhabi , UAE .",
      "Analysis .",
      "As with a painting by Vel\u00e1zquez , Manet conceived a shallow depth , where vertical and horizontal planes are barely distinguishable . According to Peter H . Feist , in The Player fife , Manet showed the appeal of the decorative effect of a large single figure , with emphatic contours and placed before a background surface . Against a monochrome background , the figure is boldly highlighted with a reduced palette of colors mostly laid on in a thick impasto which brings forth the very sharp black of the jacket and shoes , along with the red pants , white strap , spats and so on . Thus , the figure stands firm , smooth and alive .",
      "Moreover , as in Vel\u00e1zquezs work , Manet also portrayed an anonymous character , a teenage musician of the band of the Imperial Guard of Napoleon III , who was sent to Manet by commander Lejosne , treated like a grandee of Spain . Additional models may have also posed for the figure : the likenesses of both L\u00e9on Leenhoff and Victorine Meurent have been seen in the boys face and figure .",
      "In Popular Culture .",
      "A fictional tale concerning the painting forms the subject of an episode ( Art for Hogans Sake ) of the American television series Hogans Heroes , in which the work is stolen from the Louvre by a Nazi general and returned by the Allied POWs working with the French underground ."

      "Loveland , Ohio",
      "Loveland is a city in Hamilton , Clermont , and Warren counties in the southwestern part of the U.S . state of Ohio . Considered part of the Greater Cincinnati area , Loveland is located near exit 52 off Interstate 275 , about northeast of the Cincinnati city limits . It borders Symmes , Miami and Hamilton Townships and straddles the Little Miami River . The population was 12,081 at the 2010 census and was estimated at 13,145 in 2019 . Once a busy railroad town , Loveland is now a major stop along the Little Miami Scenic Trail .",
      "History .",
      "The city is named after James Loveland , who operated a general store and post office near the railroad tracks downtown . It was incorporated as a village on May 12 or 16 , 1876 , and incorporated as a chartered city in 1961 .",
      "Settlement .",
      "Present-day Loveland originally lay at the edges of the Symmes Purchase and Virginia Military District , in what was then the Northwest Territory . The area was first settled in 1795 by Col . Thomas Paxton :",
      "Village getaway .",
      "In its early days , Loveland was known as a resort town , with its summer homes for the wealthy , earning it the nickname Little Switzerland of the Miami Valley . Future Chief Justice Salmon P . Chase maintained a country home near Loveland , while the Cincinnati YWCA maintained a summer cottage there . The area was also home to Ohios first paper mill , built in 1810 by John Smith . A local road retains the mills eventual name , Kugler Mill . The area surrounding Loveland in Clermont County was well known for its peaches and strawberries . The Obionsville Post Office began operations on October 24 , 1831 , then changed its name to the Loveland Post Office on January 14 , 1848 .",
      "The Hillsboro and Cincinnati Railroad was chartered in 1846 to run a line between Hillsboro and OBannon Creek in Loveland on the Little Miami Railroads route . By 1850 , the H&C had completed the to Hillsboro , Ohio . The H&C would lease its line in perpetuity to the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad and ultimately became the mainline of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . Lovelands location at the junction of the Little Miami Railroad ( now converted into the Loveland Bike Trail ) and the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad fueled the citys growth , bringing 40 passenger trains per day , and 12 scheduled freight trains between Loveland and Cincinnati .",
      "Another railroad ran through antebellum Loveland : the Underground Railroads Eastern Route from Cincinnati included a stop at the village and continued northward to Waynesville and Lebanon . During the Civil War , Confederate Brig . Gen . John Hunt Morgan and his troops passed through Loveland , seizing possessions of northern and southern sympathizers alike ( see Morgans Raid ) .",
      "Until wagon bridges were built across the Little Miami River , settlement of Loveland was mostly confined to the Clermont County side , which had access to a railroad station . A wooden bridge spanned the river at Symmestown and Branch Hill from 1850 until it washed out six years later . For years , residents on both sides pushed for a bridge at Loveland , to avoid the long trip to Fosters Crossing or Miamiville , and by 1868 threatened to have Miami Township annexed to Hamilton County if Clermont County officials continued to obstruct the project . A $75,000 suspension bridge was finally built at Symmestown and Branch Hill and dedicated on July 4 , 1871 . It was anchored by four wrought iron columns , at that time the heaviest ever made in the United States . A second bridge , connecting East and West Loveland , was completed between 1872 and 1876 .",
      "In 1876 , the Cincinnati Campground at Loveland was the site of the holiness movements tenth annual National Camp Meeting .",
      "In 1886 , the skeleton of a mastodon and prehistoric stone tools were found in a Loveland gravel pit .",
      "In 1903 , Loveland voted to become a dry village , prohibiting the sale of alcohol within the village limits 17 years before a national ban . Loveland was a center of the Temperance movement in Ohio .",
      "Downtown Lovelands proximity to the Little Miami River has made it vulnerable to flooding . The worst such event , the Ohio Flood of March 1913 , destroyed a corn mill and washed out the Loveland Bridge , which was replaced with an iron bridge the next year .",
      "In the 1920s , The Cincinnati Enquirer ran a promotion that offered a free plot of land in Loveland , along the Little Miami River , after paying for a one-year subscription to the daily . The Loveland Castle was built on multiple plots obtained through this promotion .",
      "Growing city .",
      "After a population spike during the 1950s , Loveland reincorporated as a chartered city \u2013 the first of only two in Clermont County \u2013 on July 25 , 1961 , with George Anderson as its first mayor . The city absorbed smaller settlements , such as Paxton , Obanionsville , and Symmestown . German architect Rudolf Fr\u00e4nkel developed a master plan for Loveland .",
      "Another major flood in 1959 led to the construction of a dike along the Little Miami River in 1962\u20131963 .",
      "In 1972 and 1973 , Loveland was the site of multiple Ku Klux Klan rallies that drew members from multiple states .",
      "The long-abandoned Little Miami Railroad corridor was converted into a bike trail in the 1980s and became part of the Little Miami Scenic Trail in 1984 .",
      "Loveland has periodically sought to expand its borders by annexing surrounding areas , primarily to the more commercially active west . In 1993 , the city attempted to annex parts of Deerfield Township , prompting petitions to instead merge the township with the City of Mason . Moves to merge Symmes Township with Loveland began the next year but ultimately failed . In 1996 , Loveland moved its eastern border by purchasing Col . Paxtons original White Pillars homestead , which had remained unincorporated , despite being the first settlement in the Loveland area .",
      "In the late 1990s , Loveland was designated a Tree City by the National Arbor Day Foundation , as it began a number of efforts to promote its Historic Downtown neighborhood , in part to celebrate the citys bicentennial . The programs included a renovation of Historic Downtown itself to sport a more gentrified look , for example replacing concrete sidewalks with brick ones , installing park benches throughout , and providing incentives to businesses willing to improve their fa\u00e7ades . Major roads such as South Lebanon Road ( County Road 298 ) were expanded and given landscaped medians .",
      "The front lawn of Loveland City Hall was decorated with a nativity scene annually from 1973 until 1993 , when a representative of the Ku Klux Klan asked the city for permission to erect a cross beside the display . Since then , the nativity scene has been placed on privately owned property .",
      "The Loveland Beautification Committee was established to sponsor various programs and events that aim to improve landscapes and other buildings around town . Under the mayorship of Lee Skierkiewicz , Loveland heavily promoted itself as a cycling destination . The Tour de Loveland , an annual cycling race , was started in order to promote the Loveland Bike Trail as the centerpiece of Historic Downtown Loveland . The citys efforts culminated with USA Cycling Elite National Championship criteriums in June 1998 . On January 24 , 2005 , Loveland City Council voted to cancel the Tour , due to declining attendance and a lack of sponsors .",
      "On April 9 , 1999 , Loveland found itself in the path of an F4 tornado ( see Fujita scale ) . The tornado claimed four fatalities , including a Loveland resident , before reaching the city .",
      "With four blooms , Loveland won the 2005 America in Bloom competition for cities with 10,001 to 15,000 residents . Loveland lost to St . Ives/Carbis Bay in the 2006 Communities in Bloom International Challenge , medium category , but won the Communities in Bloom Youth Involvement Project Award .",
      "In 2004 , CSX Transportation leased the former Baltimore and Ohio railroad to RailAmericas Indiana and Ohio Railway system . On May 4 , 2007 , Ohios first four-quadrant gate was installed at the Second Street railroad crossing in Loveland , as part of a coordinated three-crossing system .",
      "In 2013 , Loveland was named a Best Hometown by Ohio Magazine .",
      "Loveland went without a mayor from August to December 2017 , after Mayor Mark Fitzgerald resigned under pressure from a recall effort and a move to replace him was declared invalid .",
      "Zoning controversies .",
      "Loveland has seen several controversies over zoning regulation . After the city acquired the White Pillars property in 1996 , it began plans to develop the land , which is situated on State Route 48 . Prior to being elected councilman , Paul Elliot participated in a lawsuit against the city over attempting to rezone the property for commercial use without voter approval . In 2003 , Mike Showler led a successful referendum to block the rezoning . An earlier attempt to develop a YMCA location on a section of Phillips Park also failed , when a group of residents protested the citys development plans , prompting the YMCA to abandon the location . In December 2006 , Loveland announced a plan to build a Loveland Recreation Center on land adjacent to Phillips Park . The city planned to enter into an operating agreement with the YMCA once the center was built ; however , the Recreation Center tax referendum was defeated in May 2007 . The Recreation Center plan was later revised , but Loveland residents again rejected an income tax levy to fund the center on November 6 , 2007 .",
      "Shooters Supply , a local gun store , proposed building an indoor shooting range at the former location of the humanitarian aid agency . Nearby residents attempted to block the shooting range , which would be built near several apartment complexes and residential neighborhoods , as well as a church . In May 2007 , the building was instead converted into a luxury boarding facility for dogs .",
      "Geography .",
      "According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water . The city is situated at an elevation of above sea level .",
      "Loveland can be reached by car most easily via Interstate 275 , but State Route 48 also serves the city . State Route 3 / U.S . Route 22 touches the northwestern corner of Loveland , and State Route 126 passes through Remington and Miamiville to the south .",
      "Loveland is located within three counties : Hamilton , Clermont and Warren . At least 61 Ohio cities cross county lines . Loveland has withdrawn from Symmes , Miami , and Hamilton Townships to form a coextensive set of paper townships each named Loveland Township . Historic Downtown Loveland and the central business district lie in a small valley on opposite sides of the Little Miami Scenic River , the boundary between Hamilton and Clermont counties , whereas most of Lovelands residential areas are located on the hills surrounding the valley on either side . Loveland City Hall is located in Clermont County , whereas most of the population resides in Hamilton County .",
      "These areas include some neighborhoods from the 1950s and earlier , as well as a number of newer subdivisions built as part of the urban sprawl that saw nearby Mason grow tremendously . Unlike Mason and other suburbs closer to Interstate 71 and Interstate 75 , Loveland is considered somewhat of a bedroom community , where residential neighborhoods ( and churches ) seemingly outnumber businesses , and many residents make the half-hour commute to Downtown Cincinnati for work each day .",
      "The 513 area code includes the entirety of Loveland . The 45140 ZIP code also includes the entire city , with the exception of a few recently annexed businesses that belong to the 45249 ZIP code ( Symmes ) . The United States Postal Service lists a number of place names as unacceptable for this ZIP code , including Murdock and Twenty Mile Stand ; however , Loveland , Ohio is acceptable for Camp Dennisons 45111 ZIP code . The 45108 FIPS55 code and codice_1 LOCODE both correspond to the city proper .",
      "Demographics .",
      "In 1880 , when the first census was taken of Loveland in Clermont County , the village had 595 residents , while the unincorporated Hamilton County community of West Loveland had 197 . In 1890 , Loveland grew to 761 residents in Clermont and Warren counties , while West Lovelands population increased to 392 .",

      "Personal life .",
      "Born in Rouen , France , to father Jean Jacques Gasly and mother Pascale , Gaslys family has long been involved in motorsports . His grandfather competed in karting and his father Jean Jacques has also competed in various categories of racing including karting , endurance racing and rallying . Gasly is the youngest alongside his four half brothers , two maternal from his mothers previous marriage ; Nicolas Caron and Cyril Caron , as well as two paternal from his fathers previous marriage ; Phillipe Gasly and Paul Gasly .

Gasly grew up alongside the late Anthoine Hubert ; karting with him since the age of seven , being educated at the same private school and having resided together as roommates for several years .",
      "Career .",
      "Karting .",
      "Gasly entered competitive karting in 2006 at the age of ten , when he finished fifteenth in the French Minime Championship , before he finished fourth the following year . In 2008 he stepped up to the French Cadet Championship , before moving to the international scene in 2009 . He moved into the KF3 category , staying until the end of 2010 , when he finished as runner-up in the CIK-FIA European Championship .",
      "Formula Renault .",
      "In 2011 , Gasly made his d\u00e9but in single-seaters , taking part in the French F4 Championship 1.6-litre category . He finished third behind his future Eurocup rivals Matthieu Vaxivi\u00e8re and Andrea Pizzitola with seven podiums , including wins at Spa , Albi and Le Castellet .",
      "Gasly moved to the 2-litre Formula Renault machinery in 2012 , joining R-Ace GP in the Formula Renault Eurocup . He finished tenth with six point-scoring finishes , including podiums at Spa and the N\u00fcrburgring . He also had seven starts in the Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup with the same team , taking a podium at the N\u00fcrburgring .",
      "For 2013 , Gasly moved to Tech 1 Racing . He took five podiums , as well as victories at Moscow , the Hungaroring and Le Castellet . He held an eleven-point lead over Oliver Rowland into the final meeting at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya , and ultimately clinched the title with third and sixth-place finishes ; the latter result coming after a collision with Rowland , who received a drive-through penalty as a result .",
      "The driver jumped to Formula Renault 3.5 Series in 2014 , where he was hired by Arden under the Red Bull Junior Team development program . He finished season as runner-up to another Red Bull Junior Carlos Sainz Jr. , collecting eight podiums in the seventeen races .",
      "GP2 Series .",
      "Gasly made his GP2 Series debut in 2014 at Monza circuit in support of Italian Grand Prix , replacing Caterham Racing driver Tom Dillmann who had commitments at other racing series and was unable to participate in GP2 Series races for that weekend . He then partook in post-season testing , driving for DAMS and signed with the French team to race alongside the British driver Alex Lynn , development driver of Williams F1 Team . Though taking three pole positions and four podiums , Gasly experienced an uneven season , including causing collisions in Bahrain , Spa and Yas Marina ( which got the subsequent race cancelled ) , which saw him finish eighth , two places behind teammate Lynn .",
      "Gasly would switch to newcomers Prema Powerteam alongside 2015 European Formula 3 runner-up and GP2 rookie Antonio Giovinazzi for 2016 . He would go on to become the GP2 Series champion that season .",
      "Japanese Super Formula .",
      "Gasly joined Team Mugen to drive a Red Bull-sponsored Honda at the 2017 Super Formula Championship , winning two races .",
      "Formula E .",
      "Gasly made a one-off Formula E appearance for Renault e.dams where he replaced S\u00e9bastien Buemi for the 2017 New York ePrix , due to the latters commitments to the World Endurance Championship . In the weekends first race , Gasly recovered from a poor qualifying performance of 19th to finish seventh in his debut race . Gasly nearly finished on the podium in the second race , hitting the wall on the exit of the final corner while battling for third and limping across the finish line with major damage in fourth .",
      "Formula One .",
      "In September 2015 , Gasly was signed as a reserve driver for Red Bull Racing .",
      "Toro Rosso ( 2017\u20132018 ) .",
      "Gasly made his Formula One race d\u00e9but at the with Scuderia Toro Rosso , replacing Daniil Kvyat for a number of races . He finished the Malaysian and Japanese Grands Prix outside the points . Gasly was expected to take Carlos Sainz Jr.s seat at Austin but he was forced to miss the race due to a clash with the final round of the 2017 Super Formula Championship . He returned to the team for Mexico , partnering with New Zealander Brendon Hartley after the team decided to drop Kvyat from the Red Bull programme .",
      "Gasly and Hartley became full-time Toro Rosso drivers for the 2018 season . In the Bahrain Grand Prix , Gasly qualified sixth , but promoted to fifth after Lewis Hamiltons penalty . He eventually finished the race in fourth place , earning his first points finish in Formula One . A week later in China , he crashed into teammate Hartley in what the two confessed as being a miscommunication . Gasly recorded four more points finishes during the season , including a 7th-place finish in Monaco and a 6th-place finish in Hungary . He ended the season in 15th place in the championship with 29 points , comfortably ahead of teammate Hartley .",
      "Red Bull ( 2019 ) .",
      "Gasly was contracted to drive for Red Bull for the 2019 season , partnering Max Verstappen following the departure of Daniel Ricciardo to Renault . Gasly struggled with the RB15 , being consistently off teammate Verstappens pace , even getting lapped by him in several races . He only out-qualified Verstappen on one occasion , in Canada , when Verstappen was hampered by a red flag in qualifying . In both China and Monaco , Gasly recorded the fastest lap of the race . His best result of the season ( whilst racing for Red Bull ) came at the British Grand Prix , finishing 4th after Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel in front were involved in a collision . This was arguably the only race where he was able to battle the frontrunners . The change came after Albons strong performance in the Toro Rosso STR14 throughout the first half of the season , with a best finish of 6th at the rain-affected German Grand Prix .",
      "Gasly came under increasing pressure at the Hungarian Grand Prix , after being lapped by Verstappen during a race in which he could have assisted Verstappen from being passed by Lewis Hamilton for the race win , had he been close enough behind . Despite Gaslys poor form , Red Bull team principal Christian Horner claimed that it was the teams intention to keep Gasly until the end of the season . By the summer break , Gasly was in 6th place in the championship with 63 points , just five points clear of Carlos Sainz Jr . in the inferior McLaren . Teammate Verstappen , meanwhile , had recorded 181 points , two race wins , five podium finishes and one pole position .",
      "Return to Toro Rosso ( 2019 ) .",
      "Ahead of the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix , Gasly was demoted back to junior team Toro Rosso with Alexander Albon taking his place . Upon the shock mid-season announcement , the team at Red Bull said in a press release , \u201cThe team will use the next nine races to evaluate Alex\u2019s performance in order to make an informed decision as to who will drive alongside Max in 2020.\u201d On the dropping of Gasly , Christian Horner said : Pierre really needs to take some time out during the break , reflect , and take the lessons into the second part of the year . We desperately need him realising more of the potential of the car .",
      "During the remainder of the season at Toro Rosso , partnering Daniil Kvyat , Gasly achieved five points finishes , including a 9th-place finish at his first race back at the team in Belgium . His best performance came at the chaotic Brazilian Grand Prix . Gasly qualified in 7th place and took advantage of retirements from Valtteri Bottas and both Ferrari drivers , as well as a collision between Lewis Hamilton and Alexander Albon , to finish the race in 2nd place after holding off Hamilton in a straight drag to the finish line . This marked the first podium finish of Gaslys Formula One career , Toro Rossos best race result since the 2008 Italian Grand Prix , and Hondas first 1\u20132 finish since the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix . On his cool-down lap , Gasly remarked over the radio : This is the best day of my life . He finished the season in 7th place in the championship with 95 points .",
      "AlphaTauri ( 2020\u2013 ) .",
      "Gasly was retained by the team , along with Kvyat , as they rebranded to Scuderia AlphaTauri . Gasly managed four top-10 finishes across the first seven races of the season , with a best result of seventh in Austria and Silverstone .",
      "At the 2020 Italian Grand Prix , an early pit stop allowed Gasly to pass several drivers - who had to wait for the pitlane to be open during a safety car procedure - and go up to a net third place . As race leader Hamilton boxed to serve a stop-go penalty and second-place driver Stroll went wide at the Roggia chicane , Gasly inherited the lead of the race and managed to hold off the late-charging Carlos Sainz to take his first win in Formula One , becoming the 109th different race winner in F1 and the first French driver to win a Grand Prix since Olivier Panis victory at the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix , 24 years prior .",
      "This prompted speculation that Gasly could return to Red Bull ( as Albon , the driver who replaced him at Red Bull , only managed to finish in 15th ) , and Gasly himself said that he was ready to do so . AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost praised Gaslys race but dismissed the possibility of Gasly returning to Red Bull soon . He finished the 2020 season in 10th place with 75 points . Gasly was retained by AlphaTauri for 2021 , partnered by Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda .",

      "The Denver and Rio Grande Western K-28 is a class of ten gauge narrow gauge Mikado type steam locomotives built in 1923-1925 by the Schenectady Locomotive Works of the American Locomotive Company ( ALCO ) for the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad . They were the first new narrow gauge locomotives ordered by the railroad since 1903 . They initially comprised class E-4-148-S , but were reclassified K-28 in 1924 when the railroad reorganized into the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad .",
      "Design .",
      "The chassis is of outside-frame design with the drive wheels placed between the two main frames and the steam cylinders and running gear ( cranks , counterweights , rods and valve gear ) to the outside . This general arrangement was also used on the earlier class K-27 and later class K-36 and K-37 engines .",
      "Operations .",
      "Among other duties , they were tasked with hauling the express passenger trains over the D&RGWs narrow gauge lines , such as the San Juan from Alamosa to Durango , the Shavano from Salida to Gunnison and The Silverton from Durango to Silverton . The K-28s also operated on the Chili Line from Antonito to Santa Fe until that route was closed in 1941 .",
      "White Pass & Yukon .",
      "During World War II , seven members of the class were purchased by the US Army for use on the White Pass and Yukon Route in Alaska and the Yukon where they were renumbered USA 250 to USA 256 . But they did not fare well in the bitter Yukon winters . In particular , the unusual , extended counterweights on the driving wheel axles made them liable to ride up on trackside ice , and as a result , lifting the engine off the rails . All seven were withdrawn from service in 1944 and were barged to Seattle in 1946 for scrapping .",
      "The K-28s today .",
      "The three locos which remained with the D&RGW , numbers 473 , 476 and 478 , were assigned to the Durango \u2013 Silverton tourist trains from the 1950s onwards . The Durango & Silverton inherited these when it took over the Silverton Branch in 1981 . As of February 13 , 2018 , all three locomotives are operational . However , as of February 2020 , number 473 is currently undergoing conversion from burning coal to burning oil and number 478 is currently awaiting a future overhaul .",
      "Due to their smaller size , these engines are often used by the Durango & Silverton for shorter trains , usually the first or last on the schedule , and also for helper service or sectioned trains . Despite being slightly smaller , a little older and less powerful than the K-36s , the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing . Firing can be tricky when the engine is working hard , as the clamshell-style firedoors tend to pull into the backhead of the boiler due to the draft , and if any flues in the boiler are leaking , the loss of draft on the fire is much harder to work around than on the K-36 locomotives . Firing while the engine is working hard is done with a large heel pattern , generally with as little coal on the flue sheet as possible , and gradually sloping the fire bed towards the door sheet to the height or higher than the firedoors . This results in the draft being forced through the fire bed in the thinner areas towards the flue sheet , which usually is hindered by the lack of draft between the grates and the arch brick . New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this because there are fewer training hours available on the K-28 class locomotives compared to the railroads usual K-36 workhorses which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving of poor technique .",
      "These locomotives are popular subjects for model railroaders and high quality scale models in HOn3 and On3 scales have been produced by several manufacturers since the 1950s .",
      "Variants .",
      "The Oahu Railway and Land Company in Hawaii was impressed with the K-28 and ordered four locomotives of the same design which were delivered in 1925 and 1926 . These were identical in specification but oil-fired and with minor differences in fittings ( slightly shorter tender with an oil tank in place of the coal bunker , smokebox front , air compressor location , headlamp , etc. )"

      "St Bartholomews Anglican Church and Cemetery , Prospect",
      "St Bartholomews Anglican Church and Cemetery is a heritage-listed former Anglican church and cemetery at Ponds Road , Prospect , City of Blacktown , New South Wales , Australia . It was designed by Henry Robertson and built from 1838 to 1840 by James Atkinson . It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 . Since 1975 , the site has been leased to the Council of the City of Blacktown .",
      "History .",
      "Aboriginal and European settler history .",
      "The area of Prospect Reservoir is an area of known Aboriginal occupation , with favourable camping locations along the Eastern Creek and Prospect Creek catchments , and in elevated landscapes to the south . There is also evidence to suggest that the occupation of these lands continued after European contact , through discovery of intermingled glass and stone flakes in archaeological surveys of the place . The area was settled by Europeans by 1789 .",
      "Prospect Hill , Sydneys largest body of igneous rock , lies centrally in the Cumberland Plain and dominates the landscape of the area . Very early after first settlement , on 26 April 1788 , an exploration party heading west led by Governor Phillip , climbed Prospect Hill . An account by Phillip states that the exploration party saw from Prospect Hill , for the first time since we landed Carmathen Hills ( Blue Mountains ) as likewise the hills to the southward . Phillips Bellevue ( Prospect Hill ) acquired considerable significance for the new settlers . Prospect Hill provided a point from which distances could be meaningfully calculated , and became a major reference point for other early explorers . When Watkin Tench made another official journey to the west in 1789 , he began his journey with reference to Prospect Hill , which commanded a view of the great chain of mountains to the west . A runaway convict , George Bruce , used Prospect Hill as a hideaway from soldiers in the mid-1790s .",
      "During the initial struggling years of European settlement in NSW , Governor Phillip began to settle time-expired convicts on the land as farmers , after the success of James Ruse at Rose Hill . On 18 July 1791 Phillip placed a number of men on the eastern and southern slopes of Prospect Hill , as the soils weathered from the basalt cap were richer than the sandstone derived soils of the Cumberland Plain . The grants , mostly 30 acres , encircled Prospect Hill . The settlers included William Butler , James Castle , Samuel Griffiths , John Herbert , George Lisk , Joseph Morley , John Nicols , William Parish and Edward Pugh .",
      "The arrival of the first settlers prompted the first organised Aboriginal resistance to the spread of settlement , with the commencement of a violent frontier conflict in which Pemulwuy and his Bidjigal clan played a central role . On 1 May 1801 Governor King took drastic action , issuing a public order requiring that Aboriginal people around Parramatta , Prospect Hill and Georges River should be driven back from the settlers habitations by firing at them . Kings edicts appear to have encouraged a shoot-on-sight attitude whenever any Aboriginal men , women or children appeared .",
      "With the death of Pemulwuy , the main resistance leader , in 1802 , Aboriginal resistance gradually diminished near Parramatta , although outer areas were still subject to armed hostilities . Prompted by suggestions to the Reverend Marsden by local Prospect Aboriginal groups that a conference should take place with a view of opening the way to reconciliation , Marsden promptly organised a meeting near Prospect Hill . At the meeting , held on 3 May 1805 , local Aboriginal representatives discussed with Marsden ways of ending the restrictions and indiscriminate reprisals inflicted on them by soldiers and settlers in response to atrocities committed by other Aboriginal clans . The meeting was significant because a group of Aboriginal women and a young free settler at Prospect named John Kennedy acted as intermediaries . The conference led to the end of the conflict for the Aboriginal clans around Parramatta and Prospect . This conference at Prospect on Friday 3 May 1805 is a landmark in Aboriginal/European relations . Macquaries Native Feasts held at Parramatta from 1814 followed the precedent set in 1805 . The Sydney Gazette report of the meeting is notable for the absence of the sneering tone that characterised its earlier coverage of Aboriginal matters .",
      "From its commencement in 1791 with the early settlement of the area , agricultural use of the land continued at Prospect Hill . Much of the land appears to have been cleared by the 1820s and pastoral use of the land was well established by then . When Governor Macquarie paid a visit to the area in 1810 , he was favourably impressed by the comfortable conditions that had been created .",
      "Nelson Lawson , third son of explorer William Lawson ( 1774-1850 ) , married Honoria Mary Dickinson and before 1837 built Greystanes House as their future family home on the western side of Prospect Hill . Lawson had received the land from his father , who had been granted here by the illegal government that followed the overthrow of Governor Bligh in 1808 .",
      "Governor Macquarie confirmed the grant , where William Lawson had built a house , which he called Veteran Hall , because he had a commission in the NSW Veterans Company . The house was demolished in 1928 and the site is now partly covered by the waters of Prospect Reservoir . Greystanes was approached by a long drive lined with an avenue of English trees - elms ( Ulmus procera ) , hawthorns ( Crataegus sp. ) , holly ( Ilex aquifolium ) , and woodbine ( Clematis sp. ) mingling with jacarandas ( Jacaranda mimosifolia ) . It had a wide , semi-circular front verandah supported by four pillars . The foundations were of stone , the roof of slate , and the doors and architraves of heavy red cedar . It was richly furnished with articles of the best quality available and was the scene of many glittering soirees attended by the elite of the colony . Honoria Lawson died in 1845 , Nelson remarried a year later , but died in 1849 , and the property reverted to his father . Greystanes house was demolished in the 1940s .",
      "By the 1870s , with the collapse of the production of cereal grains across the Cumberland Plain , the Prospect Hill area appears to have largely been devoted to livestock . The dwellings of the earliest settlers largely appear to have been removed by this stage . By the time that any mapping was undertaken in this vicinity , most of these structures had disappeared , making their locations difficult to pinpoint .",
      "The land was farmed from 1806 to 1888 when the Prospect Reservoir was built . In 1867 , the Governor of New South Wales appointed a Commission to recommend a scheme for Sydneys water supply , and by 1869 it was recommended that construction commence on the Upper Nepean Scheme . This consisted of two diversion weirs , located at Pheasants Nest and Broughtons Pass , in the Upper Nepean River catchment , with water feeding into a series of tunnels , canals and aqueducts known as the Upper Canal . It was intended that water be fed by gravity from the catchment into a reservoir at Prospect . This scheme was to be Sydneys fourth water supply system , following the Tank Stream , Busbys Bore and the Botany ( Lachlan ) Swamps . Designed and constructed by the NSW Public Works Department , Prospect Reservoir was built during the 1880s and completed in 1888 . Credit for the Upper Nepean Scheme is largely given to Edward Orpen Moriarty , the Engineer in Chief of the Harbours and Rivers Branch of the Public Works Department from 1858 to 1888 .",
      "St . Bartholemews Church .",
      "Prior to 1836 the building of churches in New South Wales had been a haphazard responsibility of the government . In 1836 the Church Act came into force to promote the building of churches and chapels and provide for the maintenance of Ministers of Religion . The Act immediately led to a spate of church building . St . Bartholemews Church of England was built by pioneers of Prospect with funds collected from 1837 .",
      "In August 1838 tenders were called for the construction of St Bartholomews Church . The contract was won by James Atkinson of Mulgoa who was building three other churches at the same time : St Peters at Richmond , St Mary Magdalene at St Marys and St Thomas at Mulgoa . His contract was with the trustees , William Lawson , Robert Crawford and Nelson Simmons Lawson . The original contract sum for the building was A\u00a31,250 , half of which was borne by private subscription and half by the Colonial Treasury . Henry Robertson is thought to have been the architect for the building although it is highly possible that William Lawson , a surveyor by training , was designer of the church .",
      "Lawson ( 1774-1850 ) who crossed the Blue Mountains with Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth in 1813 , lived in a house in Prospect called Veteran Hall ( Lawson was a lieutenant in the NSW Veterans Company , hence the name ) . Built in 1810 as a small cottage , it was extended to a forty-room mansion in 1822 . Lawsons descendants continued to improve the house until the 1880s . It was demolished in 1926 and its site is now within the Prospect Reservoir grounds . Lawson married Sarah Leadbeater on Norfolk Island while serving there and they had 11 children between 1803 and 1826 . William Lawson was buried on 16 June 1850 . One of their daughters , Sophia , was born at Prospect , and when she died in 1906 , was the last surviving child . The family vault at St . Bartholemews shelters the remains of several members of this large family .",
      "In April/May 1841 the church and cemetery were consecrated . The earliest burials , on 18 July 1841 , were Ann and Margaret Goodin , the 25 and 9 year old daughters of early settlers James and Ann Goodin . The first minutes of the vestry meeting are dated 1842 and refer to the opening of the parish registers by the Rev . H . H . Bobart , who was the rector of St . Johns , Parramatta .",
      "By 1891 over 360 burials had been recorded in the Parish Register . From the turn of the century to 1941 there was a substantial increase in the annual number of burials , reflecting the development of the district with the subdivision of farms into suburban allotments , the encroaching metropolitan area and the industrial development with the development of metal quarries , saw mills , brick and tile works and Bonds cotton spinning mills . Burials are now only permitted in previously purchased plots , the sale of which were discontinued in 1992 and in existing graves where there is space . Two burials are permitted in most plots .",
      "The condition of the church deteriorated throughout the mid-twentieth century , and a dwindling congregation and lack of financial support led to its closure in 1967 . The last service was held on Christmas Eve that year . A group of citizens interested in preserving the church formed The Prospect Trust in November 1967 under the chairmanship of Robert Brown . In late 1969 the City of Blacktown commenced negotiations with the Church of England Property Trust . A fifty-year lease over most of the property was obtained by Council in 1975 .",
      "In 1978 $20,000 was made available from National Estate Funds towards restoration provided the funds be administered by the National Trust of Australia .",
      "In 1982 a Permanent Conservation order was placed on the site . A further $100,000 were allocated for restoration by the Minister for Public Works subject to Blacktown Council meeting this amount on a dollar for dollar basis . Blacktown Council requested the Ministers offer be deferred until Council had negotiated the leasing arrangement into purchase of the building by them or the Department of Environment and Planning .",
      "Fire destroyed much of the contents of the church and severely damaged the roof in November 1989 . Parts of the original box pews and joinery , an 1850s organ brought to St Bartholomews in 1888 , a pulpit and lecterns from 1908 and all pressed metal ceilings were lost . In 1991 work commenced to repair the roof and brickwork damaged by the fire . From 2000 to 2001 the Church was completely restored , including interiors and windows with the use of Centenary of Federation funding . The restoration received an EnergyAustralia National Trust Heritage Award in 2004 .",
      "In October 2015 , the state government gave the City of Blacktown a parcel of land surrounding the cemetery , allowing the council to proceed with plans to extend the cemetery to meet the needs of the areas growing population . , this has not yet taken place , with the Council continuing to advertise that no new burial licenses can be purchased , with burials only able to take place where rights were purchased prior to 1992 .",

      "Description .",
      "Site .",
      "St Bartholomews stands on the hill for which the district is famous - Prospect Hill . It is a conspicuous landmark from which there are fine views from to the Blue Mountains and the City of Sydney . Several mature trees including Mediterranean cypress ( Cupressus sempervirens ) , arborvitae ( Thuja species ) , coral trees ( Erythrina species , possibly E.indica ) , Moreton Bay figs ( Ficus macrophylla ) , gums ( Eucalyptus spp. ) , and Bunya pine ( Araucaria bidwillii ) , and African olive ( Olea europaea var.africana ) clumps are found alongside the fence at either side of the entrance gates to the church . Remnants of early post and rail fencing and entrance gateposts are also found . Lower plantings include variegated century plant ( Agave americana Variegata ) .",
      "The church is surrounded by a graveyard laid out in a grid pattern . It contains sandstone headstones and columns and small headstones in marble and granite , many originally bordered by cast iron surrounds .",
      "Church .",
      "The building is a plain , rectangular brick structure in the Victorian Georgian style , built on an east\u2013west axis comprising nave , chancel and vestries with a tower at the west end . The tower has a square base with an octagonal belfry . The belfry roof timbers carry a timber bell supporting frame although no bell is in place . The roof over the chancel and vestries is separate from the main roof over the nave . The entrance to the building is through the tower . There are also entrances to the vestries from the exterior .",
      "The external walls are modelled by flat pilasters and finely moulded stone entablatures carried on carved stone modillion brackets , rectangular openings and blind windows . The hipped roof , originally shingled , is now clad with corrugated steel .",
      "The interior joinery was finely moulded cedar and the interior walls plastered and painted . Each vestry had a fireplace but the chimneys and mantelpieces have now been removed . The floors are timber . The chancel floor , originally one step above the main floor , has been raised further and a rectangular projecting dais into the main hall added . There is also a small dais in the north western corner of the church on which a font was once placed .",
      "Church Hall .",
      "The church hall , relocated from its original location in Wetherill Park in 1908 , is a one-storey , rectangular building . The exterior walls are corrugated iron over timber framing and the interior walls are timber boarded . The roof is corrugated steel over timber rafters with metal rods . The hall is on a brick base and may have been a prefabricated building .",
      "Condition .",
      "The physical condition of the site was reported to be good to excellent as at 9 August 2005 .",
      "Some elements have been removed for their protection and preservation . There are some problems involved in reinstating them .",
      "Heritage listing .",
      "The St Bartholomews site is closely linked with the development and history of the surrounding area and contains the graves of a considerable number of prominent families from the area since the 1840s . The church is unusually styled for its period and the graveyard is one of the earliest in western Sydney . St . Bartholomews remains a dominant landmark in the surrounding landscape due to its prominent siting , striking design and mature tree plantings .",
      "St Bartholomews Anglican Church & Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria .",
      "The place is important in demonstrating the course , or pattern , of cultural or natural history in New South Wales .",
      "The cemetery contains the graves of a number of prominent families and individuals from the founders of the community , including the Lawsons of Veteran Hall ( Blaxland , Lawson and Wentworth ) and the Westons , through to the more recent sporting fame of the Heckenbergs . It demonstrates important family lineages across its entire site from the earliest settlers to their more recent descendants , such as the Leabon and Pond families .",
      "The church is an unusually detailed and planned church . The division of the east end into three separately roofed compartments may be the only extant example in NSW of this design . It therefore occupies a special position in the architectural evolution of churches in NSW .",
      "The church hall provides an element associated with the construction of Prospect Reservoir , a major engineering achievement within the district .",
      "The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales .",
      "The site is an important surviving fragment of nineteenth century cultural landscape ; an historic icon ; a virtual oasis , and de facto public heritage green space , in a once notable rural area now surrounded by the effects of rapid urban , industrial and commercial development . It reflects a visual continuity between 19th and 20th century society . This may be seen not only in the chronological continuity of family burials , but also dramatically in the direct accommodation of power transmission towers , the F4 tollway , the modern Great Western Highway route and the first Great Western Highway route .",
      "The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social , cultural or spiritual reasons .",
      "The church is a building closely linked with the development and early history of the district .",
      "The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales .",
      "The church is an extant example of an 1840s church , providing evidence of the Church Act ."

      "History .",
      "The newest of Frankfurt\u2019s museums was founded in 1981 . The idea to set up a museum for modern art in Frankfurt came from Peter Iden , an influential theatre and art critic at the Frankfurter Rundschau and founding director of the museum ( 1978-1987 ) . With the Mayor Walter Wallmann ( CDU ) and the Head of the Cultural department Hilmar Hoffmann ( SPD ) Iden found political advocates for his project . In 1989 , the Swiss art historian and curator Jean-Christophe Ammann moved from the Kunsthalle Basel to Frankfurt am Main and opened the new Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst ( MMK ) Frankfurt am Main there on June 6 , 1991 . With a new exhibition model , the Change of Scene , which took place a total of 20 times with the help of private sponsors ( Change of Scene I , 1992 until Change of Scene XX , 2001-02 ) , the new museum gained international renown . At the change of scene exhibitions , the inventory of the museum was rearranged every six months and enriched with new additions , loans and special exhibitions .",
      "In 1983 , Hollein won the competition for the Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst ; three years earlier , his proposal for the citys Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst had finished a close second behind Richard Meiers prize-winning design . The ground-breaking was delayed until 1987 , and the new museum was eventually built at a cost of about $38 million . It opened in 1991 .",
      "The MMK Zollamt is a satellite exhibition site that belongs since 1999 to the MMK and is located in a building directly opposite the museum that once was home to the City of Frankfurts Main Customs Office . The building has been completely modernised and artistic positions by younger artists or \u201cunknowns\u201d have been presented here regularly since 2007 with the support of J\u00fcrgen Ponto-Stiftung .",
      "Architecture .",
      "Hollein molded a building to the three-sided space , so that the large rooms at the narrow end are wedge-shaped , producing 3,500 square meters ( 37,700 square feet ) of exhibition space . The height of the three-storey building is adapted to the surroundings and is characterised by the \u201ctriangular shape\u201d and facade design . The building houses three main levels for exhibitions and an administration area on the mezzanine , which is located above the entrance area and the cafeteria . The MMK library and archive are also located in this area . The entire area of the museum has a basement . There are workshops , depots and a lecture hall .",
      "Collection .",
      "The core of the museum is the legacy of German collector Karl Str\u00f6her with 87 works of Pop art and Minimalism . The manufacturer Str\u00f6her had originally bequeathed to his native city of Darmstadt on condition that a museum be built to house them . When funds for the project were not approved , Str\u00f6hers heirs sold the choice ensemble to Frankfurt and donated the painting Yellow and Green Brushstrokes by Roy Lichtenstein to the museum as a gift . Major artists since the 1950s from the Str\u00f6her Collection displayed , including Jasper Johns , Robert Rauschenberg , Carl Andre , John Chamberlain , Dan Flavin , Donald Judd , Roy Lichtenstein , Walter de Maria , Robert Morris , Claes Oldenburg , James Rosenquist , Frank Stella , Cy Twombly , Andy Warhol , Tom Wesselman and George Segal , with his Jazz Combo . Between 1981 and 1987 , the museums co-founder Peter Iden expanded the collection by adding works from the seventies and eighties . Later parts of the collection have been amassed by the museums first director , Jean-Christophe Ammann . In 2006 the Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst , along with the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein and the , acquired the private collection of Cologne art dealer Rolf Ricke , comprising works by Richard Artschwager , Bill Bollinger , Donald Judd , Gary Kuehn , und Steven Parrino . Today , the permanent collection includes over 4,500 works of international art , ranging from the 1960s to the present .",

      "Georges Jean Raymond Pompidou ( , ; 5 July 19112 April 1974 ) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1969 until his death in 1974 . He previously was Prime Minister of France from 1962 to 1968\u2014the longest tenure in the positions history . He had long been a top aide to President Charles de Gaulle ; as head of state , he was a moderate conservative who repaired Frances relationship with the United States and maintained positive relations with the newly independent former colonies in Africa .",
      "He strengthened his political party , the Union of Democrats for the Republic ( Union des Democrates pour la R\u00e9publique or UDR ) , to make it a bastion of the Gaullist movement . Pompidous presidency is generally held in high esteem by French political commentators .",
      "Biography .",
      "Georges Jean Raymond Pompidou was born on 5 July 1911 in the commune of Montboudif , in the department of Cantal in central France . After his kh\u00e2gne at Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand , where he befriended future Senegalese poet and statesman L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor , he attended the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure , from which he graduated with a degree of agr\u00e9gation in literature .",
      "He first taught literature at the lyc\u00e9e Henri IV in Paris until hired in 1953 by Guy de Rothschild to work at Rothschild . In 1956 , he was appointed the banks general manager , a position he held until 1962 . Later , he was hired by Charles de Gaulle to manage the Anne de Gaulle Foundation for Down syndrome ( de Gaulles daughter Anne had Down syndrome ) .",
      "Prime Minister .",
      "Jacques Chirac served as an aide to Prime Minister Pompidou and recalled :",
      "He served as prime minister of France under de Gaulle after Michel Debr\u00e9 resigned , from 14 April 1962 to 10 July 1968 , and to this day is the longest serving French prime minister under the Fifth Republic . His nomination was controversial because he was not a member of the National Assembly . In October 1962 , he was defeated in a vote of no-confidence , but de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly . The Gaullists won the legislative election and Pompidou was reappointed as Prime Minister . In 1964 , he was faced with a miners strike . He led the 1967 legislative campaign of the Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic to a narrow victory . Pompidou was widely regarded as being responsible for the peaceful resolution of the student uprising of May 1968 . His strategy was to break the coalition of students and workers by negotiating with the trade-unions and employers ( Grenelle conference ) .",
      "However , during the events of May 1968 , disagreements arose between Pompidou and de Gaulle . Pompidou did not understand why the President did not inform him of his departure to Baden-Baden on 29 May . Their relationship , until then very good , would be strained from then on . Pompidou led and won the 1968 legislative campaign , overseeing a tremendous victory of the Gaullist Party . He then resigned . Nevertheless , in part due to his actions during the May 1968 crisis , he appeared as the natural successor to de Gaulle . Pompidou announced his candidature for the Presidency in January 1969 . Some weeks later , his wifes name was mentioned in the Markovic affair , thus appearing to confirm her husbands status as a cuckold . Pompidou was certain that de Gaulles inner circle was responsible for this smear .",
      "In social policy , Pompidous tenure as prime minister witnessed the establishment of the National Employment Fund in 1963 to counter the negative effects on employment caused by industrial restructuring .",
      "President .",
      "After the failure of the 1969 constitutional referendum , de Gaulle resigned and Pompidou was elected president of France . In the general election of 15 June 1969 , he defeated the centrist President of the Senate and Acting President Alain Poher by a wide margin ( 57%\u201342% ) . Though a Gaullist , Pompidou was more pragmatic than de Gaulle , notably facilitating the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Community on 1 January 1973 . He embarked on an industrialisation plan and initiated the Arianespace project , as well as the TGV project , and furthered the French civilian nuclear programme . He was sceptical about the New Society programme of his prime minister , Jacques Chaban-Delmas . In 1972 , he replaced Chaban-Delmas with Pierre Messmer , a more conservative Gaullist . While the left-wing opposition organised itself and proposed a Common Programme before the 1973 legislative election , Pompidou widened his presidential majority by including Centrist pro-European parties . In addition , he paid special attention to regional and local needs in order to strengthen his political party , the UDR ( Union des Democrates pour la Ve R\u00e9publique ) , which he made a central and lasting force in the Gaullist movement .",
      "Foreign affairs .",
      "The United States was eager to restore positive relations with France after de Gaulles departure from office . New US President Richard Nixon and his top adviser Henry Kissinger admired Pompidou ; the politicians were in agreement on most major policy issues . The United States offered to help the French nuclear programme . Economic difficulties , however , arose following the Nixon Shock and the 1973\u201375 recession , particularly over the role of the American dollar as the medium for world trade .",
      "Pompidou sought to maintain good relations with the newly independent former French colonies in Africa . In 1971 , he visited Mauritania , Senegal , Ivory Coast , Cameroon , and Gabon . He brought a message of cooperation and financial assistance , but without the traditional paternalism .",
      "More broadly , he made an effort to foster closer relations with North African and Middle Eastern countries in order to develop a hinterland including all nations bordering the Mediterranean .",
      "Modernising Paris .",
      "Pompidous time in office was marked by constant efforts to modernise Frances capital city . He spearheaded construction of a modern art museum , the Centre Beaubourg ( renamed Centre Pompidou after his death ) , on the edge of the Marais area of Paris . Other attempts at modernisation included tearing down the open air markets at Les Halles and replacing them with the shopping mall of the same name , building the Montparnasse Tower , and constructing an expressway on the right bank of the Seine .",
      "Death in office .",
      "While still in office , Pompidou died on 2 April 1974 , at 9 PM , while in his apartment , from Waldenstr\u00f6ms macroglobulinemia . His body was buried on 4 April , in the churchyard of Orvilliers , where he had bought an old bakers house which he turned into a weekend home . The official memorial service for him was held at Notre-Dame de Paris with 3000 dignitaries in attendance ( including 28 heads of state and representatives from 82 countries ) .",

      "Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , later Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna of Russia ( 25 November 1876 \u2013 2 March 1936 ) was the third child and second daughter of Alfred , Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , and of Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia . She was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and also of Emperor Alexander II of Russia .",
      "Born a British princess , Victoria spent her early life in England and lived for three years in Malta , where her father served in the Royal Navy . In 1889 the family moved to Coburg , where Victorias father became the reigning duke in 1893 . In her teens Victoria fell in love with her first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia ( the son of her mothers brother , Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia ) but his faith , Orthodox Christianity , discouraged marriage between first cousins . Bowing to family pressure , Victoria married her paternal first-cousin , Ernest Louis , Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine in 1894 , following the wishes of their grandmother , Queen Victoria . The marriage failed \u2013 Victoria Melita scandalized the royal families of Europe when she divorced her husband in 1901 . The couples only child , Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine , died of typhoid fever in 1903 .",
      "Victoria married Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich in 1905 . They wed without the formal approval of Britains King Edward VII ( as the Royal Marriages Act 1772 would have required ) , and in defiance of Russias Emperor Nicholas II . In retaliation , the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honours , also initially banishing the couple from Russia . They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909 . In 1910 they moved to Russia , where Nicholas recognized Victoria Melita as Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna . After the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917 they escaped to Finland ( then still part of the Russian Republic ) where she gave birth to her only son in August 1917 . In exile they lived for some years among her relatives in Germany , and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac in Brittany . In 1926 Kirill proclaimed himself Russian emperor in exile , and Victoria supported her husbands claims . Victoria died after suffering a stroke while visiting her daughter Maria in Amorbach ( Lower Franconia ) .",
      "Early life .",
      "Victoria was born on 25 November 1876 in San Anton Palace in Attard , Malta , hence her second name , Melita . Her father , who was stationed on the island as an officer in the Royal Navy , was Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , the second son of Queen Victoria . Her mother was Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna , the only surviving daughter of Alexander II of Russia and Marie of Hesse .",
      "As a grandchild of the British monarch , she was styled Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Edinburgh . Within her family , she was always known as Ducky . At the time of her birth , she was 10th in the line of succession to the British throne . The princess was christened on 1 January 1877 at San Anton Palace by a Royal Navy chaplain . Her godparents included her paternal grandmother Queen Victoria , who was represented by a proxy .",
      "After the Duke\u2019s service in Malta was over , they returned to England , where the family lived for the next few years . They divided their time between Eastwell Park , their country home in Kent , and Clarence House , their residence in London facing Buckingham Palace . Eastwell , a large estate of 2,500 acres near Ashford , with its forest and park was the childrens favorite residence . In January 1886 , shortly after Princess Victoria turned nine , the family left England when her father was appointed commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean naval squadron , based on Malta . For the next three years , the family lived at the San Anton Palace in Malta , Victorias birthplace .",
      "The marriage of her parents was unhappy . The Duke was taciturn , unfaithful , prone to drinking and emotionally detached from his family . Victorias mother was independent-minded and cultured . Although she was unsentimental and strict , the Duchess was a devoted mother and the most important person in her childrens lives . As a child , Victoria had a difficult temperament . She was shy , serious and sensitive . In the judgment of her sister Marie : This passionate child was often misunderstood . Princess Victoria Melita was talented at drawing and painting and learned to play the piano . She was particularly close to Marie . The two sisters would remain very close throughout their lives . They contrasted in appearance and personality . Victoria was dark and moody while Marie was blonde and easy-going . Although she was one year younger , Victoria was taller and seemed to be the older of the two .",
      "Youth in Coburg .",
      "As a son of Queen Victorias deceased husband , Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , Victoria Melitas father was in the line of succession to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , the sovereign German duchy ruled by Alberts elder brother , Ernest II , until his death in 1893 . Prince Alfred became heir presumptive to the duchy when his older brother , the Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII ) , relinquished his Saxon succession rights in favour of his younger brothers . Alfred and his family therefore moved to Coburg in 1889 . Their mother immediately began attempting to Germanise her daughters by installing a new governess , buying them plain clothing , and having them confirmed in the German Lutheran church , even though they had previously been raised as Anglicans . The children rebelled and some of the new restrictions were eased .",
      "The teenage Victoria was a tall , dark girl , with violet eyes .. . with the assuredness of an Empress and the high spirits of a tomboy , according to one observer . Victoria had too little chin to be conventionally beautiful , in the opinion of one of her biographers , but she had a good figure , deep blue eyes , and dark complexion . In 1891 , Victoria travelled with her mother to the funeral of her maternal aunt Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia . There Victoria met her first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich . Although the two were deeply attracted to each other , Victorias mother was reluctant to allow her to marry him because the Russian Orthodox faith forbids the marriage of first cousins . She was also suspicious of the morality of the Romanov men . When her teenage daughters were impressed by their handsome cousins , their mother warned them that the Russian grand dukes did not make good husbands .",
      "Soon after her sister Marie was married to Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania , a search was made for a suitable husband for Victoria . Her visit to her grandmother Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle in the autumn of 1891 coincided with a visit by her cousin Prince Ernest Louis of Hesse , heir apparent to the grand ducal throne of Hesse . Both were artistic and fun loving , got along well and even shared a birthday . The Queen , observing this , was very keen for her two grandchildren to marry .",
      "Grand Duchess of Hesse .",
      "Eventually , Victoria and Ernst bowed to their families pressure and married on 19 April 1894 at Schloss Ehrenburg in Coburg . The wedding was a large affair , with most of the royal families of Europe attending , including Queen Victoria , the Empress Frederick , Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Prince of Wales . Victoria became Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine , Ernest having ascended the throne in 1892 . Her wedding is also significant since at the same time the official engagement of the future Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Ernsts younger sister , Alix , was proclaimed . Together Victoria and Ernst had two children , a daughter , Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine , who they nicknamed Ella , born on 11 March 1895 , and a stillborn son , born on 25 May 1900 .",
      "Victoria and Ernst proved incompatible . Victoria despaired of her husbands lack of affection towards her , while Ernst devoted much of his attention to their daughter , who he adored . Elisabeth , who physically resembled her mother , preferred the company of her father to Victoria . Ernst and Victoria both enjoyed entertaining and frequently held house parties for young friends . Their unwritten rule was that anyone over thirty was old and out . Formality was dispensed with and royal house guests were referred to by their nicknames and encouraged to do as they wished . Victoria and Ernst cultivated friends who were progressive artists and intellectuals as well as those who enjoyed fun and frolic . Victorias cousin Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark remembered one stay there as the jolliest , merriest house party to which I have ever been in my life .",
      "Victoria was , however , less enthusiastic about fulfilling her public role . She avoided answering letters , put off visits to elderly relations whose company she did not enjoy , and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring . Victorias inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst . The young couple had loud , physical fights . The volatile Victoria shouted , threw tea trays , smashed china against the wall , and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments . Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan . While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II , Victorias affection for Kirill was also rekindled . She enjoyed flirting with him at the balls and celebrations that marked the coronation .",
      "Divorce .",
      "Her marriage to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897 , when Victoria returned home from a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst in bed with a male servant . She did not make her accusation public , but told a niece that no boy was safe , from the stable hands to the kitchen help . He slept quite openly with them all . Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan , her charg\u00e9 daffaires , but refused to consent to her grandchildrens divorce because of their daughter , Elisabeth . Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and , when Queen Victoria died in January 1901 , significant opposition to the end of the marriage was removed . The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901 .",
      "Ernst , who had at first resisted the divorce , came to believe it was the only possible step . Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad , Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg . For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless . I only tried for her sake . If I had not loved her so , I would have given it up long ago . Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was . Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage , it had been a failure .. . [ T ] heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart . The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe . Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than the general disgrace of a divorce .",
      "Elisabeth died at age eight and a half of typhoid fever during a November 1903 visit to Tsar Nicholas II and his family at their Polish hunting lodge . The doctor advised the Tsars family to notify the childs mother of her illness , but it is rumored that the Tsarina delayed in sending a telegram . Victoria received the final telegram notifying her of the childs death just as she was preparing to travel to Poland to be at her bedside . At Elisabeths funeral , Victoria removed her Hessian Order , a medallion , and placed it on her daughters coffin as a final gesture that she had made a final break with her old home .",
      "Remarriage .",
      "After Victorias divorce from Ernst , Grand Duke Kirill , whom Victoria had seen on all her subsequent visits to Russia , was discouraged by his parents from trying to keep a close relationship with her . Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna told Kirill to keep Victoria as his mistress and marry someone else .",
      "A few months later , war broke out between Russia and Japan . As a senior member of the navy , Kirill was sent on active service to the front in the Russo-Japanese War . His ship was blown up by a Japanese mine while entering Port Arthur and he was one of the few survivors . Sent home to recover , the Tsar finally allowed him permission to leave Russia and he left for Coburg to be with Victoria . The narrow escape from death had hardened Kirills determination to marry Victoria . To those over whom the shadow of death has passed , life has a new meaning , Kirill wrote in his memoirs . It is like daylight . And I was now within visible reach of fulfillment of the dream of my life . Nothing would cheat me of it now . I had gone through much . Now , at last , the future lay radiant before me .",
      "The couple married on 8 October 1905 in Tegernsee . It was a simple ceremony , with Victorias mother , her sister Beatrice , and a friend , Count Adlerburg , in attendance , along with servants . The couples uncle Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia was invited , without being told the reason , but did not arrive until after the ceremony . Tsar Nicholas II responded to the marriage by stripping Kirill of his imperial allowance and expelling him from the Russian navy . The Tsarina was outraged at her former sister-in-law and said she would never receive Victoria , a woman who had behaved so disgracefully , or Kirill . The couple retired to Paris , where they purchased a house off the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and lived off the income provided by their parents .",
      "Victoria , who had matured as she entered her 30s , decided to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1907 , a decision that thrilled both her mother and her husband . Three days later the first of their three children , Maria Kirillovna , was born . She was named after both her grandmothers and nicknamed Masha . Their second daughter , Kira Kirillovna , was born in Paris in 1909 . Victoria and Kirill , who had hoped for a son , were disappointed to have a girl , but named their daughter after her father .",
      "Grand Duchess of Russia .",
      "Nicholas II reinstated Kirill after deaths in the Russian imperial family promoted Kirill to third in the line of succession to the Russian throne . Kirill and Victoria were allowed in Russia , Victoria was granted the title of Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna and in May 1910 , the couple arrived in St Petersburg . The new grand duchess enjoyed entertaining at evening dinners and lavish balls attended by the cream of Saint Petersburg society . Victoria had an artistic talent that she applied to home decoration in her several elaborate residences , which she arranged attractively . She decorated , gardened , and rode and also enjoyed painting , particularly watercolors .",
      "Victoria fit in within the Russian aristocracy and the circle of her mother-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna . As French was frequently spoken in high circles , Victoria never completely mastered the Russian language . Although she was a first cousin of both Nicholas II , on her mothers side , and to Empress Alexandra , on her fathers side , the relationship with them was neither close nor warm . As Kirill became a keen auto racer , the couple often took trips by car ; a favorite pastime was traveling through the Baltic provinces . Victoria dreaded the long Russian winter with its short days , and she traveled abroad , frequently visiting her sister Marie in Romania and her mother in the south of France or in Coburg . Victoria and her husband had a close relationship with their daughters , Maria and Kira . The family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the Gulf of Finland and were in Riga when the war broke out .",
      "War .",
      "During World War I , Victoria worked as a Red Cross nurse and organized a motorized ambulance unit that was known for its efficiency . Victoria frequently visited the front near Warsaw and she occasionally carried out her duties under enemy fire . Kirill , for his part , was also in Poland , assigned to the naval department of Admiral Russin , member of the staff of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich , commander in chief of the Russian army . Kirill and Victoria had always shared their relatives distaste for the Tsar and Tsarinas friendship with the starets Grigori Rasputin . The Tsarina believed Rasputin healed her son of his hemophiliac attacks with his prayers . Victoria told her sister , Queen Marie of Romania , that the Tsars court was looked upon as a sick man refusing every doctor and every help .",
      "When Rasputin was murdered in December 1916 , Victoria and Kirill signed a letter along with other relatives asking the Tsar to show leniency to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia , one of those implicated in the murder . The Tsar denied their request . Twice during the war Victoria visited Romania , where her sister Marie was now queen , volunteering aid for war victims . Victoria returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1917 . Kirill had been appointed commander of the Naval Guards , quartered in Saint Petersburg , so he could be with his family for some time . Although publicly loyal to the Tsar , Victoria and Kirill began to meet in private with other relatives to discuss the best way to save the monarchy .",
      "Revolution .",
      "At the end of the February Revolution of 1917 , Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and political turmoil followed . Victoria wrote to Queen Marie of Romania in February 1917 that their home was surrounded by a mob , yet heart and soul we are with this movement of freedom which at the time probably signs our own death warrant .. . We personally are losing all , our lives changed at one blow and yet we are almost leading the movement . By March 1917 , the revolution had spread all over Petrograd ( Saint Petersburg ) . During this period Victoria , almost 41 years old , discovered she was again pregnant , which worried her because of her previous miscarriages and difficult pregnancies .",
      "Kirill led his naval unit to the Provisional Government on 14 March 1917 , which was obliged to share headquarters with the new Petrograd Soviet , and swore loyalty to its leadership , hoping to restore order and preserve the monarchy . It was an action which later provoked criticism from some members of the family , who viewed it as treason . Victoria supported her husband and felt he was doing the right thing . She also sympathized with the people who wanted to reform the government . Kirill was forced to resign his command of the Naval Guards , but nevertheless his men remained faithful and they continued to guard Kirill and Victorias palace on Glinka Street . Close to despair , Victoria wrote to her sister Marie of Romania that they had neither pride nor hope , nor money , nor future , and the dear past blotted out by the frightful present ; nothing is left , nothing .",
      "Anxious for their safety , Kirill and Victoria decided that the best thing to do was to leave Russia . They chose Finland as the best possible place to go . Although a territory of the Russian Empire , Finland possessed its own government and constitution , so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time . They had already been once invited to Haikko , a beautiful estate , near Porvoo , a small town on the south coast of Finland , not far away from Helsinki . The Provisional Government permitted them to leave , though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them . They sewed jewels into the familys clothing , hoping they would not be discovered by the authorities . They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917 .",
      "Exile .",
      "After two weeks in Haikko , the family moved to a rented house in Porvoo where , in August 1917 , Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia , her only son and the heir to the dynasty . The family remained in Finland , a former grand duchy under Russian rule , which had declared its independence in December 1917 . They hoped that the White Russians would prevail . They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family . In July 1918 , Victoria wrote to her first cousin , Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden , begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir . She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs .",
      "She pleaded with her cousin , George V , to help the White Russians retake the country . In a letter to the King , Lord Acton , the British minister in Helsinki , noted the toll the revolution had taken on Victoria . She looked aged and battered and has lost much of her beauty , which is not astonishing considering all that she has gone through .",
      "After more than two years living under strained conditions , in the autumn of 1919 Victoria and Kirill left Finland and went to Germany . In Munich they were reunited with Victorias mother and the family group moved to Zurich in September 1919 . With the death of Victorias mother , she inherited her villa , Chateau Fabron in Nice and her residence in Coburg , the Edinburg Palais . In the following years the exiled family divided their time between these two places .",
      "While in Germany , Victoria showed an interest in the Nazi Party , which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy . She attended a Nazi rally in Coburg in 1922 . She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of the Nazi Party .",
      "Claims to the Russian throne .",
      "Kirill suffered a nervous breakdown in 1923 and Victoria nursed him back to health . She encouraged his dreams of restoring the monarchy in Russia and becoming tsar . At Saint-Briac Kirill , aware of the murders of Tsar Nicholas II and his only son , officially declared himself the Guardian of the Throne in 1924 . Victoria went on a trip to the United States in 1924 , hoping to raise American support for restoration of the monarchy . Her efforts evoked little response , due to the isolationism prevalent in the United States during the 1920s . She continued in her efforts to help Kirill restore the monarchy and also sold her artwork to raise money for the household .",
      "By the mid-1920s , Victoria worried over the prospects of her children . Maria , her eldest daughter , married the head of one of Germanys mediatized families , Karl , Hereditary Prince of Leiningen on 25 November 1925 , Victoria\u2019s 49th birthday . Victoria was at her daughters bedside when she gave birth to her first child , Emich Kirill , in 1926 ( later father of claimant to the Russian throne , Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen ) . She also attended the subsequent births of Marias children .",
      "In the mid-1920s , the German government established relations with Moscow and the presence of Kirill and his wife , pretenders to the Russian throne , became an embarrassment . Although the Bavarian government rejected pressures to expel the Russian claimant , Kirill and Victoria decided to establish their permanent residence in France . In the summer of 1926 they moved to Saint-Briac on the Breton coast , where they had spent their summer vacations . The remoteness of Brittany provided both privacy and security . They bought a large house on the outskirts of the town and gave it a Breton name , Ker Argonid , Villa Victoria . The resort town of Saint-Briac was a favorite spot for retired British citizens who wanted to live well on a limited income . Victoria made friends among the Britons as well as the French and other foreign residents of the town . Though at first her manner could seem haughty , residents soon discovered that Victoria was more approachable than her husband . Their friends treated them with deference , curtsying or calling them by their imperial titles . They lived a secluded country life , finding it more agreeable than at Coburg .",
      "Victoria was exceedingly protective of her son Vladimir , upon whom her hopes for the future rested . She would not let him attend school because she was worried about his safety and because she wanted him to be brought up as Romanov grand dukes were prior to the revolution . Instead , she hired a tutor for him . She also refused to let him be educated for a future career . In return for her devotion , Vladimir loved and respected his mother . We adored our parents and their love for us was infinite , Vladimir wrote after their deaths . All the hardships and bitterness we had to endure in the years were fully covered by our mutual love . We were proud of ( them ) .",
      "Last years .",
      "In Saint-Briac , during the summer , Kirill played golf and he and Victoria joined in picnics and excursions . They were part of the social life of the community , going out to play bridge and organizing theatricals . During the winter Victoria and her husband enjoyed visiting nearby Dinard and invited friends home for parties and games . However , it was rumored in town that Kirill went to Paris for the occasional fling . Victoria , who had devoted her life to Kirill , was devastated when she discovered in 1933 that her husband had been unfaithful to her , according to correspondence of her sister Marie of Romania . She kept up a fa\u00e7ade for the sake of her children , including her teenage son Vladimir , but was unable to forgive Kirills betrayal . Victoria suffered a stroke soon after attending the christening of her fifth grandchild , Mechtilde of Leiningen , in February 1936 . Family and friends arrived , but nothing could be done . When her closest sister reached her bedside Victoria was asked if she was glad Marie had come , to which Victoria haltingly replied , It makes all the difference . However , she shuddered away from Kirills touch , wrote Marie . She died on 1 March 1936 . Queen Marie eulogized her sister in a letter after her death : The whole thing was tragic beyond imagination , a tragic end to a tragic life . She carried tragedy within her \u2013 she had tragic eyes \u2013 always \u2013 even as a little girl \u2013 but we loved her enormously , there was something mighty about her \u2013 she was our Conscience .",
      "Victoria was buried in the ducal family mausoleum at in Coburg , until her remains were transferred to the Grand Ducal Mausoleum of the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg on 7 March 1995 . Her husband was intensely lonely after her death . The marriage of their daughter , Kira , to Louis Ferdinand , Prince of Prussia , in 1938 was a bright spot for Kirill , who saw it as the joining of two dynasties . However , Kirill died just two years after his wife . Kirill , though he had been unfaithful , still loved and missed the wife he had depended so much upon and passed his remaining years writing memoirs of their life together . There are few who in one person combine all that is best in soul , mind , and body , he wrote . She had it all , and more . Few there are who are fortunate in having such a woman as the partner of their lives \u2013 I was one of those privileged .",

P . Morgan . He negotiated a loan with the then Irish Emissary to the United States , T.D . Harry Boland , using Russian jewels as security . In June 1919 the Bureau was searched by police . In response to charges by the United States Department of Justice , Martens stated in Washington , D.C. , on January 10 , 1920 , that he had done nothing to justify being deported . \u201cMy activities in the United States have been entirely friendly and along commercial lines,\u201d he said .

      "The Indianapolis Indians are a Minor League Baseball team of the Triple-A East and the Triple-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates . They are located in Indianapolis , Indiana , and play their home games at Victory Field in downtown Indianapolis . The teams mascot is Rowdie the Bear .",
      "Founded in 1902 , the Indianapolis Indians are the second-oldest minor league franchise in American professional baseball ( after the Rochester Red Wings ) . The 1902 and 1948 Indians were recognized as being among the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time .",
      "History .",
      "The first attempt at professional baseball in Indianapolis came in the 1870s , when a club called the Indianapolis Blues operated in the National League in 1878 . After a hiatus , organized baseball began again in 1887 , and the city has hosted professional baseball nearly every year since then . After 15 years of various franchises competing in various leagues ( including four years in the National League and one year in the American Association ) , the current Indianapolis Indians franchise was founded as an original member of the American Association in 1902 . That years team won 95 games and the first of 21 pennants .",
      "The ballclub played its early seasons at several ballparks , including two on Washington Street , before Norm Perry , who took ownership of the team in 1929 , built a new stadium on 16th Street in 1931 , the Indians playing their first game there on September 5 , 1931 . He named the park Perry Stadium in honor of his brother James who had been killed in a plane crash . That ballpark was renamed Victory Field in 1942 , and Bush Stadium in 1967 , and remained the Tribes home until July 1996 .",
      "Norm Perry sold the team to Frank E . McKinney and Donie Bush in December 1941 . Those two men ran the club for 10 seasons .",
      "The Cleveland Indians purchased the team in 1952 , but after losing $500,000 on the operation over four seasons , looked to move the team . The Indianapolis community rallied to save the Indians . Funeral director Robert E . Kirby , Chairman of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Athletic Committee , obtained an option to purchase the franchise from Cleveland . A broad-based sale of stock in the team was organized . Stock was priced at $10 per share with a 100-share limit on individual purchases .",
      "Kirby , William R . Kraft , David M . Lewis , Thomas A . Moynahan , and Thomas J . OBrien got the ball rolling with investments of $200 each , and the certificate of incorporation for Indians , Inc . was received from the state of Indiana on November 9 , 1955 .",
      "Media promotion of the stock sale was intense . The Indianapolis Star , The Indianapolis News , and the Indianapolis Times ran complete lists of stock purchasers and their addresses .",
      "So successful was the drive that the original 16,000-share purchase authorization of capital stock was increased to 25,000 shares by the Secretary of State on December 5 following stockholder approval on November 30 . Eventually the new corporation stopped accepting investments in February after a total of 20,488 shares had been purchased by 6,672 investors . Former Indians player , manager , and owner Donie Bush was named the first President of Indians , Inc . He held that position until January 1969 .",
      "In 1956 , the Indianapolis Indians were 92\u201362 . On May 18 , they defeated the Louisville Colonels 24\u20130 . The Indians went on to win the 1956 Junior World Series by defeating the Rochester Red Wings . In Game 2 of the Junior World Series , Roger Maris set a record by getting seven RBIs .",
      "Max Schumacher joined the Indians front office as ticket manager in 1957 . He added the duties of publicity director in 1959 , and became the clubs general manager in 1961\u2014a post he held through 1997 . Max was also named the teams President in 1969 following Bushs retirement . To this day , he continues as President and Chairman of the Board of Indians , Inc . Under his direction , the corporation has turned a profit for 35 straight years .",
      "The team captured three straight pennants from 1961 to 1963 , including the International League championship in 1963 . ( The Indians competed in the American Association until it briefly disbanded after 1962 . The Tribe joined the IL for one season before belonging to the Pacific Coast League from 1964 through 1968 . At that point the Indians rejoined the American Association. ) In 1969 , Vern Rapp joined as manager of the Indians for 7 years . During that time , the Indians won two American Association pennants .",
      "The Indians had been affiliated with several Major League clubs over the years including Cincinnati ( 1939\u201341 , 1961 ) , Boston Braves ( 1946\u201347 ) , Pittsburgh ( 1948\u20131951 ) , Cleveland ( 1952\u20131956 ) , Philadelphia ( 1960 ) and the Chicago White Sox ( 1962\u201367 ) .

Players like Pedro Borb\u00f3n , Bernie Carbo , Dave Concepci\u00f3n , Dan Driessen , George Foster , Ken Griffey , Ray Knight , and Hal McRae all donned Tribe uniforms .",
      "The most glorious run in team history came in the 1980s after the team affiliated with the Montreal Expos .

In 1998 , Triple-A baseball expanded to 30 teams and consolidated into two leagues , with the Indians returning to the International League . After becoming the top affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers in 2000 , the Indians won the league championship and went on to capture the Triple-A World Series in Las Vegas . But sub-.500 finishes during the next four seasons prompted the Indians to break from the Brewers and join the Pittsburgh Pirates farm system for the first time since 1951 .",
      "Perhaps the most significant change in Indians history came in 1996 when the team moved downtown to a new ballpark . Taking a name from the past , Victory Field , an $18 million project on the west side of downtown and part of White River State Park , opened on July 11 , 1996 , as the Tribe hosted the Oklahoma City 89ers . The open-air facility features 13,500 permanent seats and a lawn berm around the outfield that can seat up to 2,000 additional fans . The park also features 29 luxury suites . The ballpark was designed by the same architectural firm that designed Baltimores Camden Yards and Clevelands Jacobs Field .",
      "The opening of Victory Field took the Indianapolis Indians to a new level . Attendance nearly doubled with more than 600,000 fans coming to the ballpark in each of the first five full seasons . In January 1999 , Baseball America dubbed Victory Field the best minor league ballpark in America . Those accolades were reinforced in 2001 by Sports Illustrated and minorleaguenews.com .",
      "The national commendations and record attendance marks earned the Indians a share of the national spotlight . On July 11 , 2001 representatives from all 30 Triple-A teams came to Indianapolis , and a national TV audience watched on ESPN2 as the Triple-A All-Star Game took place in front of a sellout crowd of 15,868 .",
      "In 2017 , the Indians led all of Minor League Baseball in total attendance with 641,141 fans visiting Victory Field during the regular season .",
      "Twelve Indians players and or managers have enjoyed enough success at the Major League level to warrant induction into baseballs Hall of Fame . Those players are : Samuel Big Sam Thompson , Grover Cleveland Alexander , Luke Appling , Gabby Hartnett , Randy Johnson , Harmon Killebrew , Nap Lajoie , Al L\u00f3pez , Rube Marquard , Joe McCarthy , Bill McKechnie , and Ray Schalk . Bob Uecker was recognized as a Ford C . Frick Award-winning broadcaster .",
      "In conjunction with Major League Baseballs restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021 , the Indians were organized into the 20-team Triple-A East .",

      "Auditorium Building ( Chicago )",
      "The Auditorium Building in Chicago is one of the best-known designs of Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler . Completed in 1889 , the building is located at the northwest corner of South Michigan Avenue and Congress Street ( now Ida B . Wells Drive ) . The building was designed to be a multi-use complex , including offices , a theater , and a hotel . As a young apprentice , Frank Lloyd Wright worked on some of the interior design .",
      "The Auditorium Theatre is part of the Auditorium Building and is located at 50 East Ida B . Wells Drive . The theater was the first home of the Chicago Civic Opera and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . It currently hosts the season performances of the Joffrey Ballet .",
      "The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 17 , 1970 . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975 , and was designated a Chicago Landmark on September 15 , 1976 . In addition , it is a historic district contributing property for the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District . Since 1947 , the Auditorium Building has been part of Roosevelt University .",
      "Origin and purpose .",
      "Ferdinand Peck , a Chicago businessman , incorporated the Chicago Auditorium Association in December 1886 to develop what he wanted to be the worlds largest , grandest , most expensive theater that would rival such institutions as the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City . He was said to have wanted to make high culture accessible to the working classes of Chicago .",
      "The building was to include an office block and a first class hotel . Peck persuaded many Chicago business tycoons to go on board with him , including Marshall Field , Edson Keith , Martin A . Ryerson , Charles L . Hutchinson and George Pullman . The association hired the renowned architectural firm of Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan to design the building . At the time , a young Frank Lloyd Wright was employed at the firm as draftsman , and he may have contributed to the design .",
      "The Auditorium was built for a syndicate of businessmen to house a large civic opera house ; to provide an economic base it was decided to wrap the auditorium with a hotel and office block . Hence Adler & Sullivan had to plan a complex multiple-use building . Fronting on Michigan Avenue , overlooking the lake , was the hotel ( now Roosevelt University ) while the offices were placed to the west on Wabash Avenue . The entrance to the auditorium is on the south side beneath the tall blocky eighteen-story tower . The rest of the building is a uniform ten stories , organized in the same way as Richardsons Marshall Field Wholesale Store . The interior embellishment , however , is wholly Sullivans , and some of the details , because of their continuous curvilinear foliate motifs , are among the nearest equivalents to European Art Nouveau architecture .",
      "Design .",
      "Sullivan and Adler designed a tall structure with load-bearing outer walls , and based the exterior appearance partly on the design of H.H . Richardsons Marshall Field Warehouse , another Chicago landmark . The Auditorium is a heavy , impressive structure externally , and was more striking in its day when buildings of its scale were less common . When completed , it was the tallest building in the city and largest building in the United States .",
      "One of the most innovative features of the building was its massive raft foundation , designed by Adler in conjunction with engineer Paul Mueller . The soil beneath the Auditorium consists of soft blue clay to a depth of over 100 feet , which made conventional foundations impossible . Adler and Mueller designed a floating mat of crisscrossed railroad ties , topped with a double layer of steel rails embedded in concrete , the whole assemblage coated with pitch .",
      "The resulting raft distributed the weight of the massive outer walls over a large area . However , the weight of the masonry outer walls in relation to the relatively lightweight interior deformed the raft during the course of a century , and today portions of the building have settled as much as 29 inches . This deflection is clearly visible in the theater lobby , where the mosaic floor takes on a distinct slope as it nears the outer walls . This settlement is not because of poor engineering but the fact the design was changed during construction . The original plan had the exterior covered in lightweight terra-cotta , but this was changed to stone after the foundations were under construction . Most of the settlement occurred within a decade after construction , and at one time a plan existed to shorten the interior supports to level the floors but this was never carried out .",
      "In the center of the building was a 4,300 seat auditorium , originally intended primarily for production of Grand Opera . In keeping with Pecks democratic ideals , the auditorium was designed so that all seats would have good views and acoustics . The original plans had no box seats and when these were added to the plans they did not receive prime locations .",
      "Housed in the building around the central space were an 1890 addition of 136 offices and a 400-room hotel , whose purpose was to generate much of the revenue to support the opera . While the Auditorium Building was not intended as a commercial building , Peck wanted it to be self-sufficient . Revenue from the offices and hotel was meant to allow ticket prices to remain reasonable . In reality , both the hotel and office block became unprofitable within a few years .",
      "Later uses .",
      "On October 5 , 1887 , President Grover Cleveland laid the cornerstone for the Auditorium Building . The 1888 Republican National Convention was held in a partially finished building where Benjamin Harrison was nominated as a presidential candidate . On December 9 , 1889 , President Benjamin Harrison dedicated the building and opera star Adelina Patti sang Home Sweet Home to thunderous applause . Adler & Sullivan had also opened their offices on the 16th and 17th floors of the Auditorium tower .",
      "The Chicago Symphony Orchestra debuted on October 16 , 1891 , and made its home in the Auditorium Theatre until moving to Orchestra Hall in 1904 .",
      "The opera company renting the accommodation moved to the Civic Opera House in 1929 , and the Auditorium Theatre closed during the Great Depression . In 1941 , it was taken over by the city of Chicago to be used as a World War II servicemens center . By 1946 , Roosevelt University moved into the Auditorium Building , but the theater was not restored to its former splendor .",
      "In 1952 , Congress Parkway was widened , bringing the curb to the southern edge of the building . To make room for a sidewalk , some ground-floor rooms and part of the theater lobby were removed and a sidewalk arcade created .",
      "On October 31 , 1967 , the Auditorium Theatre reopened and through 1975 , the Auditorium served as a rock venue . Among other notable acts , the Grateful Dead played there ten times from 1971 through 1977 .",
      "The Doors also played their first concert at the Auditorium Building after their arrest of singer Jim Morrison on June 14 , 1969 .",
      "It was declared a National Historic Landmark by the U.S . Department of the Interior in 1975 .",
      "The building was equipped with the first central air conditioning system and the theater was the first to be entirely lit by incandescent light bulbs . In 2001 , a major restoration of the Auditorium Theatre was begun by Daniel P . Coffey and Associates in conjunction with EverGreene Architectural Arts to return the theater to its original colors and finishes .",
      "On April 30 , 2015 , the National Football League held its 2015 NFL Draft in the Auditorium Theatre , the first time the league has held its annual draft in Chicago in more than 50 years .",

      "Charles Chase Koch ( ; born June 15 , 1977 ) , is an American businessman and the son of Charles Koch , the co-owner , CEO , and chairman of Koch Industries . Koch directs the venture capital company Koch Disruptive Technologies , and is a leading figure in Koch Industries and the familys philanthropic activities .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Koch , who is named after his grandfather and father , was born on June 15 , 1977 and raised in Wichita , Kansas , by his parents , Charles and Liz . Every Sunday , Charles Koch would educate Chase and his sister Elizabeth about his value system , libertarian economics , and philosophy . According to a 2018 profile in Politico , Chases interest in education is rooted in that childhood tutoring , which involved listening to recordings of F.A . Hayek and Milton Friedman and discussing \u201cvalues like courage and equal rights.\u201d",
      "Charles Koch expected Chase and Elizabeth to do everything to the best of their abilities . Chase played basketball at the local YMCA and attended Wichita Collegiate School . In his teens , he worked on his familys ranches . His first job , at age 15 , was at Kochs feed yard in Syracuse , Kansas , where he spent the summer digging post holes and shoveling bovine ordure . He later said that although I hated Koch Industries at the time , the experience taught him a critical life lesson about the importance of hard work .",
      "In September 1993 , at the age 16 , Koch ran a red light in Wichita as twelve-year-old Zachary Seibert , who was listening to music on his headphones , crossed the street . The car struck the boy , who died shortly thereafter at a local hospital . Chase pled guilty to a charge of misdemeanor vehicular homicide and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service and 18 months of probation .",
      "Koch graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S . in marketing . Koch has spoken of his upbringing in a variety of public speeches .",
      "After graduating , he played in a band that covered songs by Led Zeppelin , Phish , and the Grateful Dead while trying to navigate his way into Austins tech startup scene without exploiting his family connections . He told an audience in 2015 that he had seriously considered not pursuing a career in the family business .",
      "Business career .",
      "At age 25 or 26 , Koch returned to Wichita , where he began to work for Koch Industries . During the next few years , he worked in a series of high-level positions at the company , designed to provide him with an MBA-like experience .",
      "In 2006 , Koch began working for Koch Nitrogen Company , serving as a regional manager and in global supply . He was appointed president of Koch Fertilizer in 2013 and later named executive vice president of Koch Agronomic Services . As of 2016 , he was president of Koch Agronomic Services .",
      "In 2018 , he became president of the newly founded Koch Disruptive Technologies , Koch Industries venture-capital arm . Under his management , according to Bloomberg News , KDT has invested in sectors outside of Kochs traditional areas of expertise ; among the firms in which he has invested is InSightec Ltd. , which manufactures surgical tools that employ ultrasound . In a January 2019 interview on CNBC , he discussed KDTs interest in investing in principled entrepreneurs and in seeking out technologies that can transform methods of production .",
      "Throughout his career at Koch , he has chosen to work in Wichita and not at the firms Washington-area headquarters .",
      "Philanthropy .",
      "Since working at the family firm , Koch has become increasingly involved in his fathers and uncles political activities . He was present in 2003 when his father held a get-together at Chicagos Peninsula Hotel that marked the beginnings of what would later be known as the Koch network .",
      "Koch has organized a philanthropic network , consisting of the adult children of Koch network members , to replace their aging parents and grandparents . When working with this network , reported Politico in 2018 , Koch aims at nonpartisanship and avoids the hard-charging political gamesmanship often identified with the Kochs . Koch told Politico that , rather than becoming involved in political conflict , he preferred to find things that he and his philanthropic collaborators can agree on . His aim , he said , is to be a bridge-builder and an innovator focused on civil society . In 2015 , for example , he was involved in an antipoverty initiative that instructed nonprofits in the principles that helped Koch Industries to thrive . He has expressed concern about urban violence and police shootings and has lent his support to a nonprofit called Urban Specialists .",
      "In May 2018 , in Vail , Colorado , Koch led a weekend retreat attended by about two dozen affluent young professionals . Its purpose was to discuss the networks future direction and help solve problems through nonprofits and advocacy work . Koch spoke briefly about the importance of authenticity , emphasizing the significance of the role that personal transformation can play in making an impact on society . His goal , he explained , is to bring people together to address major social problems and to try to help disadvantaged individuals to surmount obstacles and achieve success . The idea that the Kochs might de-emphasize politics , commented Politico , was almost unimaginable to Washington insiders .",
      "In January 2019 , he told an interviewer that his public activities were guided by the aims of improving as many lives as possible and unlocking peoples potential . He added that he eschewed partisanship and believed in forming coalitions across the political spectrum . He noted that he was working with people like Van Jones on issues like prison reform .",
      "Board memberships .",
      "Since 2013 he has been a member of the board of Koch Industries . He is also on the board of the Charles Koch Foundation and chairman of New Leaders , which focuses on innovative and principled ideas for social improvement and professional development .",
      "Personal life .",
      "In 2010 , Koch married Annie Breitenbach , a former neonatal nurse . They live on a 70-acre property in Wichita that Koch purchased for $3 million in 2010 and have three children . Their oldest son , Charles , was born in 2012 . With Zach Lahn , a former Koch network fundraiser , Breitenbach opened Wonder , a private Montessori-style preschool and grade school on the campus of Wichita State University ."

      "Career .",
      "Karting .",
      "Born in Kumla , \u00d6rebro County , Ericssons first taste of motorsport came when he was nine years old racing in karts . I got a call from Fredrik Ekblom , whom I ran in British Formula 3000 and Indy Lights . He now runs a kart circuit and he told me about a nine-year old kid whod walked in off the street and nearly broke the lap record recalled Richard Dutton , head of Fortec Motorsport . Ekblom managed to convince Ericssons father , Tomas , to buy his son a kart and the young Swede stayed in karting for the next four years , Id never really thought about racing as a career . My family didnt have the money for me to race formula cars so we never thought about it Ericsson recalled .",
      "In 2006 Ericssons career got backing from former Champ Car driver and 1999 Indianapolis 500 winner Kenny Br\u00e4ck . I spotted Marcus at a race in Gothenburg Br\u00e4ck said , He didnt win the race because his engine blew up with two laps to go but he was clearly the best out there . He didnt get caught in any battles when passing \u2013 hed just wait for the right opportunity , then he pounced and he was away . He has such patience but when he does go for it , it measures so perfectly . He reminded me of watching Alain Prost Br\u00e4ck added .",
      "Formula BMW .",
      "Br\u00e4ck convinced Richard Dutton , who ran Br\u00e4ck in the British Formula Three Championship in 1989 , to race Ericsson for his Fortec Motorsport teams 2007 Formula BMW UK title challenge . Ericsson said of his chances during the season , I was thinking that I should be around top eight to start with , trying for podiums and maybe wins by the end of the year . Ericssons first win came at the first meeting of the series at Brands Hatch where he took third place in the first race and won from pole position in the second race . Following his win , Ericsson was described by Autosport as the best young talent Br\u00e4ck had ever seen . Ericsson was in the title race for the whole season , challenging Czech Josef Kr\u00e1l and Brit Henry Arundel . In the end Ericsson , aged 16 , won the title by 40 points from Kral , becoming the final Champion of the British Formula BMW series prior to the series merge with the German series to make a European championship .",

Afterwards Ericsson had a test with frontrunning Formula 3 Euro Series team ASM , later ART Grand Prix . Despite an offer to join ASM , Ericsson opted to stay in England and join Fortecs British Formula 3 team . Ericsson received with two pole positions and a handful of podium finishes , but no victories , which gave him fifth overall in the championship .",
      "During the winter of 2008 , Ericsson signed a contract with the Japanese F3 team TOMS to compete full-time in the championship for the upcoming season . Ericsson said that he was more likely to gain the experience needed to win the Macau Grand Prix in comparison to competing further in the British championship . Ericsson won the Japanese F3 championship , and also won races when making guest appearances back in British F3 . He consequently participated in the Macau Grand Prix where he qualified in pole position and finished the main race in fourth position .",

      "Ericsson moved into the GP2 Asia Series for the 2009\u201310 GP2 Asia Series , driving originally for the ART Grand Prix team . However , it was later confirmed that Ericsson would drive for Super Nova Racing in the 2010 GP2 Series . He had been expected to complete the rest of the Asian series with the team , but Jake Rosenzweig was signed to replace Ericsson for the final two rounds . Ericsson returned to Super Nova for the GP2 Series , partnering Josef Kr\u00e1l and later Luca Filippi . He took his first series victory at Valencia , but only scoring points on two further occasions restricted him to seventeenth place in the drivers championship .",
      "Ericsson switched to the iSport International team for 2011 , alongside Sam Bird . He finished sixth in the Asia series championship , and tenth in the main series championship . He remained with iSport for 2012 , alongside Jolyon Palmer . He won at Spa , beginning a run of six consecutive points finishes to the end of the season , including two podium finishes .

In Russia he recovered from first lap contact to beat Nasr once again and take fourteenth . In Spain he was fantastic again as he was twelfth , but in Monaco he crashed into his teammate clumsily which ruined his next race in Canada as he started at the back due to a grid penalty . He went on a slump in the following races , with 17th in Baku and 15th in Austria , with qualifying crashes in Silverstone and Hungary forcing him to start from the pit lane . Another bad couple of races followed in Hockenheim and Spa , but after that he got back on track .

      "The Senate of Canada Building ( ) is a building located at 2 Rideau Street in downtown Ottawa , Ontario , Canada that serves as the temporary seat of the Senate of Canada . The building includes the temporary Senate chamber , as well as some Senate offices and committee rooms . The building served as Ottawas central railway station until 1966 , and from 1966 to 2018 it was operated by the federal government as the Government Conference Centre .",
      "It is situated at the intersection of Wellington Street and the Rideau Canal , across the street from the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier hotel ( which was constructed around the same time ) . It is from Parliament Hill and Confederation Square .",
      "History .",
      "History of Railways in Ottawa .",
      "Before the turn of the twentieth century , several railway companies had run lines into the city and had begun to build railway stations . In chronological order :",
      "1 . New Edinburgh : Bytown and Prescott Railway",
      "2 . Broad Street : Canada Central Railway , QMO&O : 1870 , 1881 , 1896 , 1900",
      "3 . Elgin Street : Canada Atlantic Railway : early 1880s",
      "4 . Nicholas Street at Mann Avenue : Ottawa and New York Railway : 1895",
      "Broad Street , in the Lebreton Flats area , was the site of several stations including the first Union station ( 1881 ) , which perished by fire in 1896 and again in 1900 and was rebuilt each time . The last one closed in 1920 . Broad Street was near the Prince of Wales Bridge , the link to Montreal via the north shore of the Ottawa River . Broad Street itself no longer exists , erased as part of the National Capital Commissions efforts at improving the capital area .",
      "Ottawa became part of the Canadian Pacific Railways transcontinental rail service on June 28 , 1886 , when the first Pacific Express arrived at Broad Street from Montreal via Lachute and Hull , Quebec , on its way to Sudbury , Winnipeg , Calgary , and Port Moody , B.C . It used the existing Prince of Wales Bridge to cross the Ottawa River near the site of the present-day O-Train Bayview Station , west of Parliament Hill . This rail bridge had been built in 1880 by the Quebec , Montreal , Ottawa and Occidental Railway and was transferred to Canadian Pacific in 1882 .",
      "However , there was no centrally located station until 1895 , through efforts of John Rudolphus Booth . Booth was a Canadian lumber baron known for creating Canadas largest sawmill right in Ottawa , near Chaudi\u00e8re Falls . His mills capacity exceeded the distribution infrastructure , and he looked to rail as a solution . ( Eighteen years previous , he had established the Canada Atlantic Railway. ) Booth had built a central depot in 1895 just south of Rideau Street , on the east side of the canal and reachable by way of a covered stairway from Sappers Bridge . The station seemed to not be truly serving the needs of the railway companies , since it was built for the interests of the Canada Atlantic Railway .",
      "CPRs Royal Alexandra Interprovincial Bridge built in 1901 became the second railway bridge to cross the Ottawa River between Ottawa and Hull . It led to Booths central depot . In 1905 , Booth sold the Canada Atlantic Railway to the Grand Trunk Railway .",
      "In 1910 , the Grand Trunk was apportioned part of the Rideau Canal in order to build a new station and hotel . The hotel would become the famous Chateau Laurier , and the station would become Ottawas Union Station .",
      "Construction of Union Station .",
      "The building was opened by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1912 as Ottawas central railway station , and the hotel was built across the street to serve travellers . Over the course of the following years , passenger services of other railways moved to this station , thereby clarifying and unifying passenger travel in the city . When the last Canadian Pacific trains moved from the old Union Station on Broad Street to Grand Trunk Central station on January 4 , 1920 , the old station was closed and the Grand Trunk station became Ottawa Union Station .",
      "The June 1912 opening of the Union Station and the Chateau Laurier was not met with much fanfare , since Grand Trunk Railway general manager Charles Melville Hays had just perished in the Titanic disaster two months previously .",
      "The Doric Roman Revival multi pillar Union station was originally designed by New York-based architect Bradford Lee Gilbert who was eventually dismissed due to concerns of mismanagement . The Montreal firm of Ross and MacFarlane took over the project , making many design changes to the station . Ross and MacFarlane also took over the design of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier and later built Torontos Union Station .",
      "Both Canadian National Railways ( successor to the Grand Trunk ) and Canadian Pacific Railway operated regularly scheduled passenger trains through the facility until it ceased operations on July 31 , 1966 .",
      "Connection to Railways .",
      "Several tracks which originated from the main railway infrastructure in Ottawa ran immediately adjacent to the Rideau Canal ( right on its east banks ) and led northward into the city . They approached Union Station through several sheds . From the sheds , emerged two tracks ( on the east side of the Rideau Canal ) , and continued along , proceeding under the bridge where Wellington Street crosses the canal . They then ran immediately adjacent to the west side of Chateau Laurier , in a structure which was used for a time in a converted form , by the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography . The track continued , where there is now a paved road and ran to the Alexandra ( Interprovincial ) Bridge .",
      "Once in Hull , there was the possibility to continue to other parts of Quebec , or to return to Ottawa by making a turn and returning over the Prince of Wales Bridge . Some of the pathways in present-day Gatineau are on locations where rails had once made this possible .",
      "Post 1966 .",
      "In 1966 , the National Capital Commission decided to remove the tracks along the east side of the Canal as part of an urban renewal plan . They were replaced by a scenic drive , and a new Ottawa station was built just east of Ottawas downtown area in the neighbourhood of Eastway Gardens . While the NCC had originally planned to tear down the structure , it was spared , becoming the centre of Canadas centenary celebrations in 1967 . After sitting empty for many years , it was turned into the Government Conference Centre . A new entrance and canopy at the rear of the building was built to provide greater security for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers meeting held in 1973 . The same year , artist Bruce Garner sculpted bronze doors for the new entrance , titled Reflections of Canada . The tracks and sheds south of the station were demolished and now taken over by Colonel By Drive and the Rideau Centre .",
      "Current usage and architecture .",
      "It has since been home to many gatherings of civil servants and politicians . In 2001 , the building hosted the G20 conference , a gathering of 20 finance ministers from around the world .",
      "As well as hosting conferences , the building is also sometimes used as a gallery . A section of the Berlin wall was on display inside the main entrance from September 27 , 1991 , until January 29 , 2011 . Because the location of the display was not widely publicized , it was decided that the segment would be more prominent at its new location in the Canadian War Museum .",
      "The building is inspired by the Beaux-Arts architectural style . The main departures hall ( now the main conference area ) is based on the Great Hall of the Roman Baths of Caracalla at 3/4 scale . It is therefore similar to the now-destroyed departures hall of New York Penn Station .",
      "The cavernous structure has never been well suited to its role as a conference centre . In the mid-1990s a proposal was made to turn it into the new home for the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame , but these plans fell through . In his final year in office , Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien announced that the building would become home to a new museum of Canadian political history , but incoming Prime Minister Paul Martin cancelled this project , and it has remained a conference centre .",
      "In 2007 , the idea of reverting the building back to its original use sprang up as Ottawa considered various proposals for regional commuter rail systems . It is seen as being feasible to do so ( although it would require a long tunnel to reconnect to the existing railway tracks ) ; however , the Government of Canadas Department of Public Works says the building is not for sale .",
      "Temporary Senate of Canada building .",
      "In July 2013 , it was announced by Public Works Canada that the building would be used to temporarily accommodate the Senate chamber ( in the main concourse of the old train station ) along with 21 Senate offices and three committee rooms ( in the old general waiting room ) while the Centre Block undergoes major rehabilitation work projected to take up to ten years . It was decided that the need to rehabilitate this historical building presented a perfect opportunity to find an interim home for the Senate . The works which are already well under way , will include :",
      "- seismic reinforcement ;",
      "- restoration of the masonry ;",
      "- replacement of roofing materials including skylights , replacement of obsolete electrical , mechanical and life safety systems to meet current codes ;",
      "- renovation of the interior space ;",
      "- removal of outdated conference amenities added in the 1960s ( i.e . translation booths ) ;",
      "- conformity to universal accessibility requirements ;",
      "- abatement of hazardous materials ; and",
      "- expansion of the loading dock , to improve serviceability limitations of the building .",
      "In February 2019 , the Senate of Canada Building formally re-opened in its current role ."

      "P\u0159\u00edbram ( ; , Przibram or Pribram , in the time of the German occupation ( 1939\u20131945 ) Pibrans ) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic with a population of about 32,500 . The town is located on the Litavka river and the foothills of the Brdy Range , south-west of Prague ; the countrys capital . The town is well known for its mining history and more recently its new venture into economic restructuring .",
      "The town is the third largest in the Central Bohemian Region ( behind Kladno and Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav ) and is a natural administrative and cultural center of the south-western part of the region , although it also tends to be largely influenced by the economy and lifestyle of Prague .",
      "The Svat\u00e1 Hora ( Holy Mount ) pilgrimage site is located just above the town , while the Mining Museum P\u0159\u00edbram , including the communist labor camp Vojna memorial is another tourism attraction .",
      "History .",
      "From legends to Middle Ages .",
      "Several legends mentioning P\u0159\u00edbram in the early history of Czech statehood are mentioned in the Annales Bohemorum written by V\u00e1clav H\u00e1jek z Libo\u010dan in the first half of the 16th century . The legends talk about princess Libu\u0161es prophecy and the destroying of the B\u0159ezov\u00e9 Hory mines by Horym\u00edr of Neum\u011btely . Both of these mentioned stories also depict the silver mining in the region .",
      "H\u00e1jek also explains the name of the town , although his etymology is now believed to be partially fancied , the basics of it is probably true , as the town name is derived from the name of a person , probably the site owner .",
      "From 1216 ( first written mention ) , the P\u0159\u00edbram estate was owned by the bishops of Prague and it soon received its walls . The town castle was built under Prague archbishop Arno\u0161t of Pardubice . During Hussite wars in the 15th century , P\u0159\u00edbram stood on the reformation side , but was captured and pillaged four times by Catholic aristocracy .",
      "Archbishop Zden\u011bk Zaj\u00edc of Hasenburk gave P\u0159\u00edbram town privileges , which were confirmed by King Ji\u0159\u00ed z Pod\u011bbrad in 1463 , and in 1496 P\u0159\u00edbram was named town by King Ladislaus II , as P\u0159\u00edbram was passed over to Czech kings hands . The economic state of the town however decreased as the rulers often impledged the town and temporary masters did not care about the town development .",
      "Modern history .",
      "Information about the silver and iron mining in P\u0159\u00edbram were furthered in mining books from late 16th century survived to present days . In 1579 Rudolf II promoted the reputation of P\u0159\u00edbram by naming it the Royal Mining City . The Thirty Years War had a large impact on P\u0159\u00edbram , lowering the population and causing violent recatholicization that was supported by the growing importance of Holy Mountain , nearby the pilgrimage site .",
      "Since the 17th century the mining boom was followed with the town growth . The town however gave the majority of its mining profit share over in favor of central Vienna government , which soon slowed the development of the town when the silver mining was at its peak at the end of the 18th century .",
      "Five major deep-mines are built in the 18th century in B\u0159ezov\u00e9 Hory near P\u0159\u00edbram , starting with the St . Adalbert mine ( ) . The P\u0159\u00edbram mining district became one of the most modern in Europe in the 19th century , which remained true until the 1920s . P\u0159\u00edbram built educational sites and became the seat of central mining authorities and the mining academy . The St . Mary mine ( ) fire in 1892 was a large-scale catastrophe , as 319 miners died . Although the real importance of P\u0159\u00edbram mines declined after 1900 , the towns reputation as the educational and cultural centre remained high .",
      "Region with strong partisan resistance was around P\u0159\u00edbram during World War II . Several prominent citizens participated in the resistance , and many were killed by Nazi occupiers . Student Anton\u00edn Sto\u010des , his father and P\u0159\u00edbrams gymnasium director Josef Luke\u0161 , were executed in T\u00e1bor in the 1942 days following the assassination of Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich . Their story was idealized in Jan Drdas fiction Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed princip ( ) . General Richard Tesa\u0159\u00edk , the Hero of the Soviet Union , or legionary Alois Laub , leader of the military resistance group Oliver , executed in Brandenburg in 1945 , were born in P\u0159\u00edbram .",
      "At the beginning of May 1945 , P\u0159\u00edbram spontaneously rose up against the occupiers , the Czech authority took formally the power , but the Wehrmacht unit threatened with declaration of martial law . After negotiations , the town was liberated by the Soviet partisan brigade Death of Fascism ( , ) led by Captain Yevgeny Antonovich Olesinsky . Although the majority of German forces had left the town before the liberation itself , P\u0159\u00edbrams surroundings are said to be the place where the last shots of the World War II were fired . German troops trying to leave Soviet zone over the demarcation line were met by partisan units and eventually fought Soviet Army , General von P\u00fcckler agreed to a surrender 12 May 1945 , four days after the V-E Day .",
      "In 1953 , the cities of P\u0159\u00edbram and B\u0159ezov\u00e9 Hory were merged - today B\u0159ezov\u00e9 Hory is part of P\u0159\u00edbram called P\u0159\u00edbram VI - B\u0159ezov\u00e9 Hory .",
      "The last epoch of P\u0159\u00edbram mining occurred since the 1950s , when the district was opened again for uranite mining , several mines around the town were opened . The industry was included into a program of penal labour that Communist Czechoslovak government used for persecution of regime objectors . Labor camps P\u0159\u00edbram-Vojna and P\u0159\u00edbram-Brod were run there 1949\u20131951 , holding up to 800 detainees . The new town quarter was built for more than a half of citizens ; B\u0159ezov\u00e9 Hory and several villages ( e.g . Zdabo\u0159 ) became part of the town , which population overcame 40,000 citizens .",
      "Located near to the Brdy military area , P\u0159\u00edbram was an important locality during the 1968 Occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact forces . The army command in P\u0159\u00edbram was labeled focus of contrarevolution in the Czechoslovak Army as it did not cooperate the occupation forces and harbored the Czechoslovak Television during its independent broadcasting . The rioting of P\u0159\u00edbram-Byt\u00edz crime prisoners and the strike of P\u0159\u00edbram miners were the other major events related to the August 1968 invasion .",
      "The 1989 Velvet Revolution influenced the town life as much as the mines closure .",
      "Politics and administration .",
      "P\u0159\u00edbram town assembly is the highest authority of the town . Authorities are elected during communal election every four years and has 25 members . The assembly elects the Town council of six members including the mayor and two vice-mayors . P\u0159\u00edbram is a center of the eponymous district and has a status of the municipality with extended agency .",
      "All town council seats are now occupied by the Czech Social Democratic Party ( \u010cSSD ) members and the SNK European Democrats ( SNK-ED ) , their minority coalition was enabled by the votes of Communists . Jan Konvalinka ( ANO 2011 ) is the current town mayor .",
      "P\u0159\u00edbram area of almost is divided into 18 town quarters , nine central numbered using Roman numerals , the others are usually the villages added to the town before in the second half of the 20th century like Brod , Byt\u00edz , Jerusalem , Lazec , \u017de\u017eice and others .",
      "Elections in P\u0159\u00edbram .",
      "The last time the town council was elected October 2006 . During the post parliamentary election period when there was no state government with Parliaments confidence and the situation was highly confrontational between the two strongest Czech parties \u2013 the Civic Democrats ODS and Social Democrats \u010cSSD .",
      "Both parties strengthened their position in the P\u0159\u00edbram council for the second elections in a row , while the Christian Democrats of the former mayor Josef Vacek lost both two remaining seats , Vacek himself did not act as the party leader , but he was unsuccessfully running for re-election .",
      "The result gave the Civic Democrats a chance to continue their coalition with the Social Democrats or to close a coalition deal with the SNK European Democrats , but they were not able to do so . After two weeks of negotiations , the minority coalition of Social Democrats and SNK European Democrats was approved by the Communists votes . The coalition broke later and it was substituted by a large majority coalition of Social Democrats and Civic Democrats .",

GT sold Humongous to its parent company , Infogrames ( later renamed Atari SA ) , in August 2005 , as a result of which the company was shut down a few months after . Infogrames transitioned the label to a new company , Humongous , Inc. , which continued publishing games under the Humongous label until 2013 , when it faced bankruptcy . As part of the bankruptcy agreement of the Atari SA subsidiary Atari , Inc. , Humongous , Inc . and Atari Interactive , Tommo acquired the Humongous brand and all of its assets , and went on to re-release some of its games into digital distribution channels in conjunction with Night Dive Studios .",
      "History .",
      "Formation ( 1992\u20131996 ) .",
      "Humongous Entertainment was formed by Shelley Day and Ron Gilbert in 1992 , then based in Woodinville , Washington . The name Humongous Entertainment was suggested by Gilberts ex-LucasArts colleague , Tim Schafer . It became known for creating four point-and-click adventure game series intended for young children , branded collectively as Junior Adventures , with the four series being the Putt-Putt series , the Freddi Fish series , the Pajama Sam series and the Spy Fox series . Despite all four series being developed and released in parallel , characters from one series do not formally cross over with ones in another and instead appear as cameos or Easter eggs in any of the three other series . The company became the third largest childrens educational-software company .",
      "In 1995 , Gilbert and Day established a company division , Cavedog Entertainment , in Seattle , set to develop games of alternative genres , and released Total Annihilation , a real-time strategy ( RTS ) game , in 1997 . This was followed by two expansion packs in 1998 , as well as a variation called plus an expansion pack in 1999 .",
      "Acquisitions , decline , dissolution ( 1996\u20132006 ) .",
      "On July 11 , 1996 , Humongous Entertainment was purchased by GT Interactive for . In November 1997 , Humongous Entertainment signed a five-year worldwide deal with Nickelodeon to develop games based on the Nick Jr . series , Blues Clues , making it the first and only time that Humongous has developed games based on a licensed character as opposed to its original characters . In November 1999 , GT Interactive was acquired by Infogrames and renamed it Infogrames , Inc . In 2000 , Humongous Entertainment released a One-Stop Fun Shop activity center game for each Junior Adventure series , with the exception of Spy Fox . The co-founders tried to buy Humongous Entertainment back from Infogrames , Inc. , using external funding , but the day of the planned purchase was the day of the dot-com collapse , wherefore the funding was pulled . The founders soon left Humongous , alongside many other key employees , and formed a new studio , Hulabee Entertainment , in 2001 . In June 2001 , Infogrames , Inc . laid off 82 personnel , over 40% of staff from Humongous Entertainment . In May 2003 , after Infogrames , Inc . purchased Hasbro Interactive\u2014which owned the rights to the Atari brand\u2014the company was renamed Atari , Inc . In August 2005 , facing financial struggles , Atari , Inc . sold Humongous Entertainment to majority stock holder Infogrames for , under the condition that all titles developed by Humongous Entertainment are released through March 31 , 2006 . No further game was completed by Humongous Entertainment in the given time , and the company was dissolved the day after . Infogrames then transitioned all assets and brands to a newly established company , Humongous , Inc. , not bound to any agreement from Atari , Inc. , which would go on to publish several titles under the Humongous name until 2009 , mainly with Majesco Entertainment . By that time , Majesco had released ports of the first installments of each Junior Adventure series , except Putt-Putt , to the Wii , taking advantage of the Wii Remotes point-and-click functionality , but their availability was greatly limited by a legal conflict concerning their development .",
      "Asset sale , brand revival ( 2013\u20132015 ) .",
      "Finding itself in a difficult financial situation , Infogrames ( then renamed Atari , SA ) , filed bankruptcy for three of its American subsidiaries , Atari , Inc. , Atari Interactive and Humongous , Inc . in 2013 . As part of the resolution proceedings , the Humongous brand and most game assets were transferred to Tommo on July 19 , 2013 . Furthermore , the Backyard Sports series was acquired by The Evergreen Group , and MoonBase Commander by Rebellion Developments . Using the trademark , Tommo re-launched the Humongous.com website in January 2014 , and , together with Night Dive Studios , went on to re-release several Humongous Entertainment titles under the Humongous Entertainment label into digital distribution channels Steam , between April 2014 and August 2015 .",

      "Hugh Scott",
      "Hugh Doggett Scott Jr . ( November 11 , 1900 \u2013 July 21 , 1994 ) was an American lawyer and politician . A member of the Republican Party , he represented Pennsylvania in the US House of Representatives from 1947 to 1959 and in the US Senate , from 1959 to 1977 . He served as Senate Minority Leader from 1969 to 1977 .",
      "Born and educated in Virginia , Scott moved to Philadelphia to join his uncles law firm . He was appointed as Philadelphias assistant district attorney in 1926 and remained in that position until 1941 . Scott won election to represent Northwest Philadelphia in the House of Representatives in 1940 . He lost re-election in 1944 but won his seat back in 1946 and served in the House until 1959 . Scott established a reputation as an internationalist and moderate Republican Congressman . After helping Thomas E . Dewey win the 1948 Republican presidential nomination , Scott held the position of Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1948 to 1949 . He also served as Dwight Eisenhowers campaign chairman in the 1952 presidential election .",
      "Scott won election to the Senate in 1958 , narrowly prevailing over Democratic Governor George M . Leader . He was a strong advocate for civil rights legislation and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 , 1960 , 1964 , and 1968 , as well as the 24th Amendment to the US Constitution , the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S . Supreme Court . He won election as Senate Minority Whip in January 1969 and was elevated to Senate Minority Leader after Everett Dirksens death later that year . As the Republican leader in the Senate , Scott urged President Richard Nixon to resign in the aftermath of the Watergate Scandal . Scott declined to seek another term in 1976 and retired in 1977 .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "The son of Hugh Doggett and Jane Lee ( n\u00e9e Lewis ) Scott , Hugh Doggett Scott was born on an estate in Fredericksburg , Virginia , that was once owned by George Washington . His grandfather served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War under General John Hunt Morgan , and his great-grandmother was the niece of President Zachary Taylor . After attending public schools in Fredericksburg , he studied at Randolph\u2013Macon College in Ashland , Virginia , from which he graduated in 1919 . He enrolled in the Student Reserve Officers Training Corps and the Students Army Training Corps during World War I .",
      "In 1922 , Scott earned his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law at Charlottesville , where he was a member of the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society and the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity . His interest in politics was established after he frequently attended committee hearings in the Virginia House of Delegates .",
      "Early political career .",
      "Scott was admitted to the bar in 1922 and then moved to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , where he joined his uncles law firm . Two years later , he married Marian Huntington Chase to whom he remained married until her death in 1987 . The couple had one daughter , Marian .",
      "Scott , who had become a regular worker for the Republican Party , was appointed assistant district attorney of Philadelphia in 1926 and served in that position until 1941 . He claimed to have prosecuted more than 20,000 cases during his tenure . From 1938 to 1940 , he served as a member of the Governors Commission on Reform of the Magistrates System .",
      "United States House of Representatives .",
      "In 1940 , after longtime Republican incumbent George P . Darrow decided to retire , Scott was elected to the US House of Representatives from Pennsylvanias 7th congressional district . The district was then based in Northwest Philadelphia . He defeated Democratic candidate Gilbert Cassidy by a margin of 3,362 votes . In 1942 , he was re-elected to a second term after defeating Democrat Thomas Minehart , a former member of the Philadelphia City Council and future Pennsylvania Treasurer ; Scott received nearly 56% of the vote .",
      "In 1943 , he became a member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati . In 1944 , Scott was defeated for re-election by Democrat Herb McGlinchey , losing by only 2,329 votes .",
      "Scott joined the United States Navy Reserve in 1940 . He served during World War II , and was posted to both Iceland with the Atlantic Fleet and the USS New Mexico with the United States Pacific Fleet . He was among US forces that entered Japan on the first day of post-war occupation , and was discharged with the rank of commander .",
      "In 1946 , Scott reclaimed his House seat , handily defeating McGlinchey by a margin of more than 23,000 vote by speaking out against both President Franklin Roosevelts betrayal at Yalta and communists in Washington , DC . He was reelected five times , and served until winning election to the U.S . Senate .",
      "During his tenure in the House , Scott established himself as a strong internationalist by voting in favor of the Lend-Lease Act of 1941 , foreign aid to both Greece and Turkey , and the Marshall Plan . He also earned a reputation as a moderate Republican by supporting public housing , rent control , and the abolition of the poll tax as well as other legislation sought by the Civil Rights Movement . From 1948 to 1949 , he served as chairman of the Republican National Committee ; he received the position after helping New York Governor Thomas E . Dewey obtain the Republican nomination in the 1948 presidential election . Facing staunch opposition from Ohio Senator Robert A . Taft , Scott barely survived a no-confidence ballot but still resigned as RNC chairman . He later served as campaign chairman for Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election .",
      "United States Senate .",
      "In 1958 , after fellow Republican Edward Martin declined to run for re-election , Scott was elected to the US Senate . He narrowly defeated his Democratic opponent , Governor George M . Leader , by a margin of 51 to 48 percent . Scott continued his progressive voting record in the Senate by opposing President Eisenhowers veto of a housing bill in 1959 and a redevelopment bill in 1960 . He voted to end segregationist Democratic senators filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 , and he later sponsored 12 bills to implement the recommendations of the Civil Rights Commission . A memorable quote from Scott came during the U-2 Incident in 1960 , when he said , We have violated the eleventh Commandment \u2014 Thou Shall Not Get Caught .",
      "In 1962 , Scott threatened to run for Governor of Pennsylvania if the Republican Party did not nominate the moderate Representative William W . Scranton over the more conservative Judge Robert E . Woodside , a former Pennsylvania Attorney General . He even supported Scranton as a more liberal alternative to conservative Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination in the 1964 presidential election . Scott also faced re-election in 1964 and overcame the national landslide for Democratic President Lyndon Johnson to defeat the state Secretary of Internal Affairs , Democrat Genevieve Blatt , by approximately 70,000 votes .",
      "Scott voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 . In 1966 , along with two other Republican Senators and five Republican Representatives , Scott signed a telegram sent to Georgia Governor Carl Sanders on the Georgia legislatures refusal to seat the recently elected Julian Bond in its state House of Representatives . The refusal , said the telegram , was a dangerous attack on representative government . None of us agree with Mr . Bonds views on the Vietnam War ; in fact we strongly repudiate these views . But unless otherwise determined by a court of law , which the Georgia Legislature is not , he is entitled to express them .",
      "Scott supported New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller for the Republican nomination in the 1968 presidential election . Scott was reelected again in 1970 , defeating Democratic State Senator William Sesler by a margin of 51 to 45 percent . Scott served until January 3 , 1977 and was elected Senate Minority Whip in January 1969 . After the death of Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen in September 1969 , Scott was narrowly elected Senate Minority Leader over Tennessee Senator Howard Baker ( Dirksens son-in-law ) , serving until 1977 .",
      "In 1967 , Scott held a Fellowship at Balliol College , Oxford , where he contributed regularly to Alan Montefiores politics seminar for postgraduates . Once , when he and Montefiore started talking at the same time , Scott carried on speaking with the amiable excuse : You can remember what you want to say longer than I can .",
      "Scott was Chairman of the Select Committee on Secret and Confidential Documents ( 92nd Congress ) . He wielded tremendous influence .",
      "Scott was displeased with the Nixon administration and believed that it was aloof , unapproachable , and contemptuous of him . Scott believed that he would be given a major role in setting administration policy but was disappointed when that did not occur . Actively assisting in the behind-the-scenes transition from the Nixon administration to the Ford administration in the months leading up to the resignation of President Richard Nixon , Scott sought assurance from Gerald Ford that Scott would be able to address Ford as Jerry even after Ford became President .",
      "Scott was one of the three Republican leaders in Congress to meet Nixon in the Oval Office of the White House to tell Nixon that he had lost support of the party in Congress , on August 7 , 1974 . The meeting came the day before Nixon would announce his resignation from the presidency . The delegation was led by senior party leader and Arizona Senator Goldwater and also included House Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes ( R-Arizona ) . The erosion of Nixons support had progressed after the June 1972 Watergate break-in .",
      "In 1976 , the Senate undertook an ethics inquiry into accusations that he had received payment from lobbyists for the Gulf Oil Corporation . Scott acknowledged having received $45,000 but claimed that they were legal campaign contributions .",
      "He did not run for re-election in 1976 and was succeeded by Republican John Heinz . The same year , he chaired the Pennsylvania delegation to the Republican National Convention .",
      "Later life .",
      "Scott was a resident of Washington , DC and then Falls Church , Virginia , until his death there in 1994 . He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery . His papers are held at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia .",

      "- Abstract : While their different public personas , political interests , and institutional duties led to occasional disagreement , President Richard Nixon and Senate Minority Leader Scott were not always unhappily tethered as evidenced by their stances on domestic and foreign issues throughout Nixons presidency , during 1968\u201374 . While he jousted with Nixon over racial policies and his Supreme Court nominations , including his choice of Judge Clement F . Haynsworth , Jr. , of South Carolina , Scott supported much of Nixons domestic agenda , applauded the presidents conduct of foreign affairs , backed his Vietnam policy , praised his invasion of Cambodia , publicly proclaimed Nixons innocence during the Watergate scandal , and endorsed President Gerald Fords pardon of his predecessor . The Nixon-Scott relationship is notable because it confirms scholars assumptions about Nixons hot-and-cold association with Congress and indicates that sparring between moderate Republicans like Nixon and Scott was on its way out .",

It was created in 1896 for Empress Alexandra Feodorovna . The egg currently resides in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts .",
      "Design .",
      "The egg was created by Faberges workmaster , Mikhail Evlampievich Perkhin ( Russian , 1860\u20131903 ) with miniatures by Johannes Zehngraf ( Danish , 1857\u20131908 ) It stands about 248 mm ( 9 3/4 in ) tall on its stand , with a diameter of 98 mm ( 3 7/8 in. ) The outer shell is rock crystal banded with emerald-green enameled gold studded with diamonds . On the apex of the egg is a Siberian emerald supported by an emerald-green enameled gold mount . This cabochon-style emerald is one of the largest gemstones Faberg\u00e9 used in any of the Imperial eggs . The eggs base sits on a plinth of rock crystal . The base consists of a colorfully enameled gold double spheroid which is circled twice with rose-cut diamonds . It has the monograms of the Tsarina , as the Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt before her marriage , and later as Alexandra Fedorovna , Empress of Russia . Each monogram is surmounted with a diamond crown of the respective royal house . These monograms form a continuous pattern around the base of the egg .",
      "Surprise .",
      "Inside the rock crystal egg is a gold support holding twelve miniature paintings . The paintings are of the various palaces and residences that were significant to the Empress . Each location holds a special memory for Nicholas and Alexandra in the early days of their courtship , as they had just been married two years prior , in 1894 .",
      "When the large cabochon emerald on the apex is depressed it engages a mechanism that rotates the miniatures inside the egg . A hook moves down and folds the framed pictures back , like the pages of a book , so two paintings can be fully seen at one time . Each miniature is framed in gold with an emerald on the apex . The frames are attached to a central fluted gold shaft which passes vertically through the egg .",

      "In 1909 , the egg was housed in the Empress study in the Winter Palace . The egg was seized by the Kerensky Provisional Government and moved to the Armory Palace of the Kremlin in Moscow along with approximately 40 other eggs . In 1930 , the Rock Crystal Egg was one of the ten Eggs sold by the Antikvariat ( Trade Department ) to the Hammer Galleries in New York City for 8000 rubles , or approximately $4000 U.S .

      "Erich Topp",
      "Erich Topp ( 2 July 1914 \u2013 26 December 2005 ) was the third most successful of German U-Boat commanders of World War II . He was a recipient of the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords of Nazi Germany . He sank 35 ships for a total of . After the war he served with the Federal German Navy , reaching the rank of Konteradmiral ( rear admiral ) . He later served in NATO .",
      "Early life and career .",
      "Topp was born in Hannover on 2 July 1914 . Topp joined the Reichsmarine on 8 April 1935 as a member of Crew 34 ( the incoming class of 1934 ) . He received his military basic training in the 2nd company in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the Baltic Sea in Stralsund ( 8 April 1934 \u2013 13 June 1934 ) . He was then transferred to the school ship Gorch Fock on 14 June 1934 , and to the light cruiser on 27 September 1934 . Under the command of Kapit\u00e4n zur See G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens , Topp sailed on Karlsruhes fourth training cruise . Karlsruhe left Kiel on 22 October 1934 . The ship sailed via Skagen , the Azores and Trinidad on the east coast of South America , passed the Cape Horn , up the west coast of South , Middle and North America to Vancouver . At Callao ( 25 January \u2013 6 February 1935 ) they joined in the 400-year celebration of Peru . Karlsruhe returned to Kiel on 15 June 1935 , travelling through the Panama Canal to Houston , Charlestown and Vigo , Spain .",
      "Following his journey on Karlsruhe , Topp attended the main cadet course at the Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik ( 30 June 1935 \u2013 29 June 1936 ) . During this time frame at the naval academy , he advanced in rank to F\u00e4hnrich zur See ( officer cadet ) on 1 July 1935 . Starting on 30 June 1936 , he underwent a number of specialized weapons training courses for cadets at various naval schools . On 16 October 1936 , he was again transferred to Karlsruhe , staying onboard until 31 March 1937 . The next day , he was promoted to Leutnant zur See ( Second Lieutenant ) and took a torpedo training course which he completed on 17 April . On 18 April , he was yet again posted to Karlsruhe , serving as an adjutant until 4 October 1937 .",
      "On 5 October 1937 , Topp started his U-boat training at the U-boat school in Neustadt in Holstein before he became an instruction officer at the naval non-commissioned officer training department in Friedrichsort , a borough of Kiel , on 2 June 1938 . Topp was then posted to the Wegener Flotilla on 26 September 1938 . There , he was appointed 1st watch officer on under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Herbert Sohler . On 1 April 1939 , Topp was promoted to Oberleutnant zur See ( sub-lieutenant ) .",
      "National Socialism .",
      "In May 1933 , Topp joined the Nazi Party and in 1934 also joined the Allgemeine-SS . Topp took the Hitler oath , convinced it was the right thing to do . To the beginning of the war at least , his peers regarded Topp as a Nazi . Topp made the acquaintance of Martin Bormann , Hitlers personal secretary and head of the Nazi Party Chancellery . Bormann married the sister of Topps crew mate , Walter Buch . Topp was close enough to be invited to Bormanns residence in Berchtesgaden . Topps political outlook was not shared by his uncle . His aunt through marriage , Anna Topp , was Jewish . During the Nazi reign she was sent to and survived the Theresienstadt Ghetto . In his memoirs Topp claimed not to have believed in Nazi ideology . One analyst wrote , the contrasts and Topps individual course make obvious the limitations of any quantitative study [ of his political convictions ] .",
      "Topp came to terms with the Nazi regime and its crimes postwar . He entered into heated arguments with former comrades over the cause for which they fought . Topp was particularly critical of Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz , commander-in-chief of U-boats and later the Kriegsmarine . After the war , Topp expressed his view that the German naval command , and his superior Karl D\u00f6nitz , knew of the Holocaust . Topp referenced D\u00f6nitzs commitment to National Socialism , admiration for Hitler , and his presence at the Posen speeches . Topp was critical of D\u00f6nitzs pretensions to have been an apolitical soldier . Topp said of D\u00f6nitz , that his failure to do anything about it comes very close to a passive toleration of these insane crimes . Few former U-boat commanders were as vocal in attacking D\u00f6nitzs character . His aunts experiences in the ghetto from 1943 may have been a factor . D\u00f6nitz confronted Topp personally when the latter called upon him . He purportedly greeted Topp with a question , I understand you think I should have been executed ? He presented Topp with his accusation , underlined , and a letter from Samuel Eliot Morison , the official historian of the United States Navy , which accepted D\u00f6nitzs defence that he knew nothing of the Nazi crimes . It was Morison who told D\u00f6nitz of Topps accusations , or doubts , as Topp later claimed they were .",
      "World War II .",
      "World War II commenced following the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 . U-46 , under the command of Sohler , had already been at sea since 19 August , returning to port on 15 September . Topp sailed on three further patrols on U-46 ( 3 October \u2013 7 November 1939 , 19 December 1939 \u2013 10 January 1940 and 11 March \u2013 23 April 1940 ) . During these patrols , U-46 sank one ship of on 17 October and another ship of on 21 December . For his service on U-46 , Topp was awarded the U-boat War Badge ( ) on 7 November 1939 and the Iron Cross 2nd Class ( ) in January 1940 . On 1 May 1940 , he was transferred to the 1st U-boat Flotilla .",
      "Command of U-57 .",
      "After eight war patrols under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Claus Korth , command of of the 1st U-boat Flotilla was passed to Topp on 5 June 1940 . Topps fifth war patrol began in Kiel on 11 July 1940 and was destined for the North Atlantic , into the North Channel , and The Minch . Because the Gruppenhorchger\u00e4t , a hydrophone array , was experiencing technical difficulties , Topp took U-57 to port for repairs . U-57 arrived in Bergen on 15 July , departed again that day only to return to Bergen on 20 July . Two days later , U-57 was able to begin its patrol . The Befehlshaber der U-Boote ( BdU\u2014supreme commander of the U-boat arm ) credited Topp with the sinking three ships of of shipping . On 7 August , U-57 arrived in Lorient , France .",
      "On 14 August 1940 , U-57 departed from Lorient on its tenth war patrol . Again Topp led U-57 into the North Atlantic , the North Channel and the Hebrides . On this patrol , Kretschmer sank three ships of , and damaged another ship of . On 3 September 1940 , U-57 collided with the Norwegian vessel Rona near the lock at Brunsb\u00fcttel and sank . Following the loss of U-57 \u2014 the boat was later raised and used for training purposes \u2014 Topp was awarded Iron Cross 1st Class ( ) and initially remained with 1st U-boat Flotilla . On 4 November , he was sent to Blohm & Voss , the shipbuilding works in Hamburg , for construction training of , a Type VIIC U-boat .",
      "Transfer to U-552 .",
      "On 4 December 1940 , Topp took command of U-552 and commissioned the U-boat into the 7th U-boat Flotilla . Following sea trials and training , Topp , with Leutnant zur See Siegfried Koitschka as his second watch officer , took U-552 on its first war patrol on 13 February 1941 . The patrol which was destined for the North Atlantic west of Ireland began in Kiel . That day , they headed for Brunsb\u00fcttel where they stayed one day . The following day , U-552 made a stopover at Cuxhaven before leaving for Heligoland on 15 February . After three days at Heligoland , Topp took the boat into the North Atlantic . U-552s first patrol ended in Saint-Nazaire , France on 16 March 1941 . On this patrol , Topp sank two ships of .",
      "The second patrol on U-552 began on 7 April 1941 from Saint-Nazaire and targeted the shipping routes in the North Atlantic , south of Iceland . On this patrol , the BdU credited Topp with the sinking of three ships and one escort totaling . The patrol ended on 6 May , again in Saint-Nazaire . In reality , Topp sank three ships totaling , and damaged one ship of which was then sunk by ( Adalbert Schnee ) . The third ship sunk during Topps second patrol in command of U-552 , was the troopship S.S . Nerissa ( 5,583 GRT , 207 casualties and 84 survivors ) on 30 April 1941 about 140 nautical miles west of the North Channel . This sinking resulted in the third largest loss of life for a ship sunk by U-boats in the approaches to the British Isles during the Second World War .",
      "On 25 May , Topp took U-552 on its third war patrol . The next day , U-552 returned to Saint-Nazaire before heading for North Channel on 3 June . The BdU assumed that Topp sank three ships of and he was awarded the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross ( ) on 20 June 1941 . This patrol ended on 2 July in Saint-Nazaire . Later analysis revealed that the true tonnage sunk accumulated to . One of the ships was the Norfolk . The vessel carried mail an steel plates among 4,000 tons of general cargo . Captain Frederick Lougheed and 69 men were saved ; one man was lost .",
      "Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Harro Schacht was Topps commander in training on U-552s fourth war patrol . The patrol , which began on 18 August and ended on 26 August in Saint-Nazaire , resulted in the sinking of one ship of . This ship had previously been damaged by ( Reinhard Suhren ) . Following this patrol , Topp was promoted to Kapit\u00e4nleutnant ( Captain Lieutenant ) on 1 September 1941 . The fifth war patrol took U-552 into the North Atlantic , patrolling southeast of Greenland . Topp left Saint-Nazaire on 4 September and sank three ships of . U-552 returned to Saint-Nazaire on 5 October .",
      "Reuben James and Second Happy time .",
      "The next patrol began on 25 October and ended on 26 November 1941 in Saint-Nazaire . This was also Koitschkas last war patrol as first watch officer on U-552 . On U-552s sixth war patrol into the North Atlantic , east of Grand Banks of Newfoundland , Topp sank the destroyer on 31 October 1941 , the first United States Navy warship to be lost in World War II while it escorted Convoy HX 156 . The torpedo struck a forward magazine , blowing the ship apart . All of her officers and over 100 of the crew went down with the ship . The destruction of the Reuben James facilitated a worsening of already rapidly deteriorating diplomatic relations between Nazi Germany and the still nominally neutral United States of America . President Franklin D . Roosevelt used the incident to shift public opinion toward a confrontational stance with the European Axis powers . Support for the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s gradually eroded . On 13 November 1941 amendments to the act allowed for the arming of US merchant ships , their operation in the war zone , and active assistance to the British Empire to increase the tonnage available to it . Hitler and the Nazi leadership wished to keep the US neutral and the order to minimise contact at sea remained in force , at least until Operation Barbarossa had destroyed the Soviet Union . Roosevelt did not publicly mention the destroyer was escorting a British convoy , was not flying the Ensign of the United States , and was in the process of dropping depth charges on another U-boat when it was engaged and sunk .",
      "On 11 December 1941 , Hitler declared war on the United States . D\u00f6nitz ordered immediate offensive operations off the East Coast of the United States . Codenamed Operation Drumbeat ( Unternehmen Paukenschlag ) , the U-boat fleet inflicted the largest naval defeat on the United States Navy in history . Though few in number at the beginning\u2014just five\u2014the U-boats pressed home attacks close to the shore , from Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico . The American failure to initialise a blackout , ship captains insistence on following peace-time procedures , and lack of effective naval defences contributed to high losses . 397 ships were sunk during Drumbeat . The Germans termed this period , the Second Happy Time . Topp crossed the Atlantic and joined Wolfpack Zieten .",
      "Oberleutnant zur See Albrecht Brandi joined Topps crew as a commander in training on U-552s seventh war patrol . The patrol to the West Atlantic , Grand Banks of Newfoundland , and Nova Scotia started on 25 December in Saint-Nazaire . Topp sank three ships totaling before returning to Saint-Nazaire on 27 January 1942 . Topp experienced mechanical problems with his torpedoes . On 15 January he expended four on the small merchant ship Dayrose from a range of 800 metres before a fifth sank it . Topp signalled BdU about the incident . Topp experienced the same problems in the sinking of Frances Salman , five miles south of Cape Race . Repeated failures were psychologically unnerving . Unable to load the spare torpedoes from deck stowage due to icing and inclement weather , BdU called him home .",
      "The eighth war patrol took U-552 to West Atlantic and to the East Coast of the United States . Topp left Saint-Nazaire on 7 March , returning on 27 April . On this patrol , he sank seven ships with a total tonnage of . While at sea , Topp received the message on 11 April that he had been awarded the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( ) . He was the 87th member of the Wehrmacht to be so honoured . On 11 April , Karl D\u00f6nitz also awarded him the U-boat War Badge with Diamonds ( ) .",
      "Topps sinking of the has cast a shadow on his conduct in action . When he spotted the coastal steamer off Chincoteague , Virginia on 3 April 1942 , he surfaced U-552 , overtook it from astern , and , without offering the Captain the chance to surrender , attacked it with his deck gun from 600 yards , firing a total of 93 rounds . Captain Bill Webster was killed in the shelling . Atwaters civilian Merchant Marine crew of 27 suffered 24 lost lives during the attack . According to one account , when United States Coast Guard Cutter number 218 Legare appeared , it found the ship sunk with only several feet of its mast still visible . Bodies were seen , including one in a lifeboat riddle with machine gun holes . There is no direct evidence he machine-gunned defenseless crewmen , and nothing in Topps otherwise stellar career or postwar actions suggest he was capable of such an act .",
      "Topps ninth war patrol on U-552 went to the North Atlantic , west of Spain . Leaving Saint-Nazaire on 9 June , Topp sank five ships totalling before returning to port ten days later . Topp formed part of a strong wolf pack against Convoy HG 84 . Topp engaged the convoy west-northwest of A Coru\u00f1a . Topp achieved all his successes on this patrol against HG 84 . On his tenth and last war patrol on U-552 , Topp sank two ships of and damaged two further of . Topp had left Saint-Nazaire on 4 July and returned from the North Atlantic on 13 August . Upon his return , he was awarded the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( ) on 17 August . He was the 17th member of the Wehrmacht to be so honored . That day , he also received a preferential promotion to Korvettenkapit\u00e4n ( Corvette Captain ) and D\u00f6nitz presented him an honorary dagger of the Kriegsmarine with Diamonds .",
      "Ashore .",
      "Command of U-552 was passed on to Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Klaus Popp . Topp officially remained with the 7th U-boat Flotilla until 4 November when he was appointed chief of the 27th U-boat Flotilla , a training flotilla based in Gotenhafen ( now Gdynia , Poland ) . In August 1944 , Topp was appointed head of the department charged with introducing the Type XXI submarines into service , the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged . In this position , he was promoted to Fregattenkapit\u00e4n ( Frigate Captain ) on 1 December 1944 .",
      "On 23 March 1945 , he was appointed commander of in the 4th U-boat Flotilla , and commander of in the 11th U-boat Flotilla on 26 April . On 20 May 1945 , Topp was taken prisoner of war in Krager\u00f8 , Norway . He was released on 17 August 1945 . Topps boat , U-2513 , was tested by the United States Navy . American reports concluded at twelve knots submerged speed she is quieter than our best fleet submarines at six...up to ten knots she is extremely quiet . The same report concluded at least seven ships were required to carry out a search for the XXI submarine .",
      "Later life and Bundesmarine .",
      "On 4 June 1946 , he started at the Technical University of Hannover , studying architecture , and graduated in 1950 with a degree in engineering . He also served as technical advisor for the 1957 film Sharks and Little Fish .",
      "On 3 March 1958 , Topp joined West Germanys navy , at the time named the Bundesmarine ( Federal Navy ) , holding the rank of Fregattenkapit\u00e4n . His first assignment was with the F\u00fchrungsstab der Marine ( Navy Staff ) . On 16 August 1958 , he served with the NATO Military Committee in Washington , D.C. , initially as a naval speaker , later as the chief-of-staff of the German delegation in Washington . During this assignment , he was promoted to Kapit\u00e4n zur See ( captain at sea/captain ) on 1 November 1959 . On 1 January 1962 , Topp was transferred to the position of commander of the Bundesmarines ( amphibious forces ) , a position he held until 30 September 1963 . In parallel , on 1 November 1962 , he was made acting commander of , serving in this capacity until 1 December 1962 .",
      "Topp was then appointed chief-of-staff of the ( Fleet Command ) on 1 October 1963 . On 1 July 1965 , he headed the sub command department with F\u00fchrungsstab der Marine in the Federal Ministry of Defence . There , Topp was promoted to Flottillenadmiral ( flotilla admiral ) on 15 November 1965 . On 1 October 1966 , Topp was named deputy Inspector of the Navy and at the same time became the chief of the F\u00fchrungsstab der Marine in the Federal Ministry of Defence . In this role , Topp was promoted to Konteradmiral ( Counter Admiral ) on 21 December 1966 . Topp held this position until 30 September 1969 . He then continued to serve with Inspector of the Navy until his retirement on 31 December 1969 . For his service with the Bundesmarine , Topp was awarded the Commanders Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ( ) on 19 September 1969 .",
      "In 1968 , Topp had been considered as head of the Plans & Policy department with the Allied Forces Northern Europe ( AFNORTH ) in Kols\u00e5s , Norway which at the time was headed by the German Konteradmiral Heinrich Erdmann . The Supreme Allied Commander Europe ( SACEUR ) , US General Lyman Lemnitzer , had originally approved this nomination . In order to not unnecessarily stress the German-Norwegian relationship , Topp had sunk four Norwegian vessels in World War II , Lemnitzer later decided against Topp and appointed Konteradmiral Friedrich Guggenberger instead .",
      "After retiring from the Bundesmarine , for a few years Topp was a technical advisor to the German shipyard HDW AG . His service as a NATO advisor was loosely portrayed ( as Commodore Wolfgang Schrepke ) in the 1965 movie The Bedford Incident . His memoirs The Odyssey of a U-Boat Commander : The Recollections of Erich Topp was published in 1992 . When Topp was asked in 1996 by publisher/historian Theodore P . Savas to contribute a Foreword for a collection of essays on German U-boat commanders , he instead submitted a contribution about his close friend Engelbert Endrass , who was lost with his crew and boat off Gibraltar in late December 1941 . Topp had privately penned the piece about their friendship on his next patrol to the east coast of America , but had never submitted it for publication . The essay was translated from German and footnoted by Dr . Eric Rust , and appeared as the opening chapter in Silent Hunters : German U-boat Commanders of World War II ( 1997 , 2003 , 2005 ) . Savas also recruited Topp to serve as the technical adviser for the 2001 submarine simulation computer game Silent Hunter II , and a series of interviews with him appears in the game . He was interviewed on World War II submarine operations for the Nova ( TV series ) special Hitlers Lost Sub , which detailed the efforts of a team of divers , led by John Chatterton and Richie Kohler to identify an unknown German U-boat wreck 65 miles off the coast of New Jersey ; the wreck was identified as .",
      "A large oil painting of his close deceased comrade Endrass hung in his home after the war up until the time of his death . In his front room overlooking the Rhine River was the top of the periscope from U-552 , which immediately after the war some of his crewman had managed to remove from the captured boat and pass to him as a keepsake . Topp died on 26 December 2005 , in S\u00fc\u00dfen at the age of 91 ; he was survived by two sons , Peter Kay ( 1945-2015 ) and Michael ( b . 1950 ) , and five grandchildren .",

      "Southern Military District ( , Milo S ) , originally I Military District ( ) was a Swedish military district , a command of the Swedish Armed Forces that had operational control over Southern Sweden , for most time of its existence corresponding to the area covered by the counties of Malm\u00f6hus , Kristianstad ( now joined as Sk\u00e5ne County ) , Blekinge , Kronoberg , J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping and Kalmar . The headquarters of Milo S were located in Kristianstad .",
      "History .",
      "Milo S was created in 1966 along with five other military districts as part of a reorganisation of the administrative divisions of the Swedish Armed Forces . It can be seen as the successor of the I Military District ( I . milit\u00e4romr\u00e5det ) created in 1942 , but that did not have the same tasks as Milo S . The military district consisted of the land covered by the above-mentioned counties , with the exception of a small part of northern Kalmar County which instead was part of the Eastern Military District ( Milo \u00d6 ) until 1983 when the whole countys area was incorporated into Milo S . In 1993 , the number of military districts of Sweden was decreased to three , and as a consequence of that , Western Military District ( Milo V ) was merged with Milo S to form a new southern military district . In 2000 , these last three military districts were disbanded and the command for the whole of Sweden was placed at the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters , in accordance with the Defence Act of 2000 .",

As a child , she was fascinated with the Chinese arts of paper cutting of silhouette puppetry , even building her own puppet theatre so that she could put on shows for her family and friends .",
      "As a teenager , Reiniger developed a love of cinema , first with the films of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s for their special effects , then the films of the actor and director Paul Wegener , known today for ( 1920 ) . In 1915 , she attended a lecture by Wegener that focused on the fantastic possibilities of animation . Reiniger eventually convinced her parents to allow her to enroll in the acting group to which Wegener belonged , the Theatre of Max Reinhardt . She began by making costumes and props and working backstage . She started making silhouette portraits of the various actors around her , and soon she was making elaborate title cards for Wegeners films , many of which featured her silhouettes .",
      "Adulthood and success .",
      "In 1918 , Reiniger animated wooden rats and created the animated intertitles for Wegeners Der Rattenf\u00e4nger von Hameln ( The Pied Piper of Hamelin ) . The success of this work got her admitted into the Institut f\u00fcr Kulturforschung ( Institute for Cultural Research ) , an experimental animation and shortfilm studio . It was here that she met her future creative partner and husband ( from 1921 ) , Carl Koch , as well as other avant-garde artists including Hans C\u00fcrlis , Bertolt Brecht , and Berthold Bartosch .",
      "The first film Reiniger directed was Das Ornament des verliebten Herzens ( The Ornament of the Enamoured Heart , 1919 ) , a five-minute piece involving two lovers and an ornament that reflects their moods . The film was very well received , and its success opened up many new connections for Reiniger in the animation industry .",
      "She made six short films over the next few years , all produced and photographed by her husband , including the fairytale animation Aschenputtel ( 1922 ) . These shorts were interspersed with advertising films ( the Julius Pinschewer advertising agency innovated ad films and sponsored a large number of abstract animators during the Weimar period ) and special effects for various feature films\u2014most famously a silhouette falcon for a dream sequence in Part One of Die Nibelungen by Fritz Lang . During this time , she found herself at the centre of a large group of ambitious German animators , including Bartosch , Hans Richter , Walter Ruttmann and Oskar Fischinger .",
      "In 1923 , she was approached by Louis Hagen , who had bought a large quantity of raw film stock as an investment to fight the spiraling inflation of the period . He asked her to do a feature-length animated film . There was some difficulty that came with doing this , however . Reiniger is quoted as saying We had to think twice . This was a never heard of thing . Animated films were supposed to make people roar with laughter , and nobody had dared to entertain an audience with them for more than ten minutes . Everybody to whom we talked in the industry about the proposition was horrified . The result was The Adventures of Prince Achmed , completed in 1926 , one of the first animated feature films , with a plot that is a pastiche of stories from One Thousand and One Nights . Although it failed to find a distributor for almost a year , once premiered in Paris ( thanks to the support of Jean Renoir ) , it became a critical and popular success . Because of this delay , however , The Adventures of Prince Achmeds expressionistic style did not quite fit with the realism that was becoming popular in cinema in 1926 . Reiniger uses lines that can almost be called colorful to represent the films exotic locations . Today , The Adventures of Prince Achmed is thought to be one of the oldest surviving feature-length animated films , if not the oldest . It is also considered to be the first avant-garde full-length animated feature .",
      "Reiniger , in devising a predecessor to the multiplane camera for certain effects , preceded Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney by a decade . Above her animation table , a camera with a manual shutter was placed in order to achieve this . She placed planes of glass to achieve a layered effect . The setup was then backlit . This camera setup was later invented simultaneously and innovated in cel animation . Reiniger wrote instructions on how to construct her trick-table in her book , Shadow puppets , shadow theatres , and shadow films . In addition to Reinigers silhouette actors , Prince Achmed boasted dream-like backgrounds by Walter Ruttmann ( her partner in the Die Nibelungen sequence ) and Walter T\u00fcrck , and a symphonic score by Wolfgang Zeller . Additional effects were added by Carl Koch and Berthold Bartosch .",
      "Following the success of Prince Achmed , Reiniger was able to make a second feature . Doktor Dolittle und seine Tiere ( Doctor Dolittle and his Animals , 1928 ) was based on the first of the English childrens books by Hugh Lofting . The film tells of the good Doctors voyage to Africa to help heal sick animals . It is currently available only in a television version with new music , voice-over narration and the images playing at too many frames per second . The score of this three-part film was composed by Kurt Weill , Paul Hindemith and Paul Dessau .",
      "A year later , Reiniger co-directed her first live-action film with Rochus Gliese , Die Jagd nach dem Gl\u00fcck ( The Pursuit of Happiness , 1929 ) , a tale about a shadow-puppet troupe . The film starred Jean Renoir and Berthold Bartosch and included a 20-minute silhouette performance by Reiniger . Unfortunately , the film was completed just as sound came to Germany and release of the film was delayed until 1930 to dub in voices by different actors\u2014the result being disappointing .",
      "Reiniger attempted to make a third animated feature , inspired by Maurice Ravels opera Lenfant et les sortil\u00e8ges ( The Child and the Bewitched Things , 1925 ) , but was unable to clear all of the individual rights to Ravels music , the libretto ( by the novelist Colette ) , and an unexpected number of copyright holders . When Ravel died in 1937 the clearance became even more complex and Lotte finally abandoned the project , although she had designed sequences and animated some scenes to convince potential backers and the rights-holders .",
      "Reiniger worked on several films with British poet , critic , and musician Eric Walter White , who wrote an early book-length essay on her work .",
      "Flight from Germany and later life .",
      "With the rise of the Nazi Party , Reiniger and Koch decided to emigrate ( both were involved in left-wing politics ) , but found that no other country would give them permanent visas . As a result , the couple spent the years 1933\u20131944 moving from country to country , staying as long as visas would allow . With the release of sound film , Reiniger and her husband began to work with music in relation to animation . They worked with film-makers Jean Renoir in Paris and Luchino Visconti in Rome . They managed to make 12 films during this period , the best-known being Carmen ( 1933 ) and Papageno ( 1935 ) , both based on popular operas ( Bizets Carmen and Mozarts Die Zauberfl\u00f6te ) . When World War II commenced they stayed with Visconti in Rome until 1944 , then moved back to Berlin to take care of Reinigers sick mother . Under the rule of Hitler , Reiniger was forced to make propaganda films for Germany . One of these films is called ( The Golden Goose , 1944 ) . She had to work under stringent and limiting conditions to please the German state , which is why some of her work in this time period may appear creatively stifled .",
      "In 1949 , Reiniger and Koch moved to London , where she made a few short advertising films for John Grierson and his General Post Office Film Unit ( later to be renamed the Crown Film Unit ) . While she was living in London in the early 1950s she became friends with Freddy Bloom , the chair of the National Deaf Childrens Society and editor of quarterly magazine called TALK , who asked her to design a logo . Reiniger responded by cutting out silhouettes of four children running up a hill . Freddy Bloom was amazed at her skill with the scissors\u2014in a few moments she created about four different silhouettes of the children from black paper . One of them was used as cover design on the magazine TALK from 1956 . The logo was used until the 1990s , when a design company was invited to revamp it . The result was a very minor modification , but this new design was dropped a few years later.<In the early 1950s she was working at Beconsfield studios in Buckinghamshire.>",
      "With Louis Hagen Jr . ( the son of Reinigers financier of Prince Achmed in Potsdam ) , they founded Primrose Productions in 1953 and , over the next two years , produced more than a dozen short silhouette films based on Grimms Fairy Tales for the BBC and Telecasting America . Reiniger also provided illustrations for the 1953 book King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table by Roger Lancelyn Green .",
      "After a period of seclusion after her husbands death in 1963 , renewed interest in her work resulted in Reinigers return to Germany . She later visited the United States , and began making films again soon after . She made three more films , the last of which , Die vier Jahreszeiten , was completed the year before she died .",
      "Reiniger was awarded the of the Deutscher Filmpreis in 1972 ; in 1979 she received the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany . Reiniger died in Dettenhausen , Germany , on 19 June 1981 , just after her 82nd birthday .",
      "Art style .",
      "Reiniger had a distinct art style in her animations that was very different from other artists in the time period of the 1920s and the 1930s , particularly in terms of characters . In the 1920s especially , characters tended to rely on facial expressions to express emotions or action , while Reinigers characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions . She also utilized the technique of metamorphosis often in her animations . This focus on transformation greatly benefits her tendency to work with fairytale stories . The Adventures of Prince Achmed specifically adapts fantastic elements to take advantage of animation to show things that could not be shown in reality . Reiniger considered animations separation from the laws of the material plane to be one of the greatest strengths of the medium .",
      "Because of this , Reinigers characters are not usually biologically correct , but they are able to express a fluidity which is very important to her style of expressionism . Although there are other animators in that time period that used these techniques , Reiniger stands out because she is able to accomplish this style using cutout animation . Reinigers figures resemble stop-motion animation in the way that they move .",
      "Influence .",
      "Reinigers black silhouettes would become a popular aesthetic to reference in films and art . Although all subsequent makers of animated fairy tales could be said to have been influenced by Reiniger , Bruno J . B\u00f6ttge is probably the one who has made the most explicit references to her work .",
      "Disneys Fantasia uses Reinigers style in the beginning of the scene where Mickey Mouse is in the same shot as the live-action musicians , as well as in The Princess and the Frog during the musical number Friends on the Other Side .",
      "Disney would also use a multipleplane camera in its own movies , such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , based on the technology that Reiniger originally developed .",
      "Starting with the silhouette format in the 1989 television series Cin\u00e9 si , French animator Michel Ocelot employs many of the techniques created by Reiniger , along with others of his own invention , in his silhouette film Princes et princesses .",
      "Bram Stokers Dracula briefly included a silhouetted scene in its opening a homage to early cinema technique like Reinigers .",
      "The animated series South Park uses a paper cut-out style reminiscent of Reinigers .",
      "Reinigers cut-out animation style was utilized in the credits of the 2004 film Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events .",
      "In the 2010 film , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 , animator Ben Hibon used Reinigers style of animation in the short film titled The Tale of the Three Brothers .",
      "The animated series Steven Universe paid homage to the style of Reinigers films in the episode The Answer .",
      "Legacy .",
      "The municipal museum in T\u00fcbingen holds much of her original materials and hosts a permanent exhibition , The World in Light and Shadow : Silhouette , shadow theatre , silhouette film . The Filmmuseum D\u00fcsseldorf also holds many materials of Lotte Reinigers work , including her animation table , and a part of the permanent exhibition is dedicated to her . Collections relating to her are also held at the BFI National Archive .",
      "On June 2 , 2016 , Google celebrated Reinigers 117th birthday with a Google Doodle about her .",

      "Bal des d\u00e9butantes",
      "Le Bal des D\u00e9butantes , also known simply as le Bal ( or , previously , the Crillon Ball ) , is a debutante ball and fashion event held annually in November that brings together 20\u201325 girls aged 16 to 22 from about a dozen countries .",
      "Starting in 1992 , it has been organised by Oph\u00e9lie Renouard as a couture event by invitation . The young women don gowns from haute couture and couture designers , as well as foreign fashion houses . They all wear jewelry from the same jeweler . The d\u00e9butantes usually come from famous families .",
      "The event raises money for charity ; the most recent editions have supported two organizations . Since 2009 , le Bal has supported , which provides education for girls in Southeast Asia . Since 2015 it has also supported Seleni , a non-profit that finances research in healthcare for adolescent mothers .",
      "In 2005 , Forbes cited it as one of the worlds 10 hottest parties .",
      "Fashion houses .",
      "The ball introduces to its d\u00e9butantes the world of high fashion while creating an impression of it to the rest of the world . It can also be deemed as an important opportunity for fashion houses to achieve brand exposure .",
      "For example , in 2008 , French actor Jean Rocheforts daughter Cl\u00e9mence , made her debut wearing a Nina Ricci gown . Anna Cleveland van Ravenstein , on the other hand , had been modeling for Chanel for years before Uncle Karl [ Lagerfeld ] helped her pick out a vintage gown for le Bal .",
      "Some couture houses have produced special gowns for the event , for instance Carolina Herrera in 2003 for Diana Mellon , and , in 2014 , Danish designer Jesper Hovring for Viola Mikkelsen . In 2018 , the Indo-French fashion house Lecoanet Hemant made a gown for Princess Ananya Raje Scindia of Gwalior . Jet Lis daughter Jane Li was dressed by Dior in 2019 .",
      "The Event .",
      "Planning and preparations include inviting the d\u00e9butantes and their cavaliers and meetings with the debs and their families .",
      "From 1992 to 2012 , le Bal was organized at the H\u00f4tel de Crillon . The H\u00f4tel Raphael was the hotel of le Bal in 2013 and 2014 and the event was held in the Palais de Chaillot in 2015 , overlooking the Eiffel Tower . Le Bal was held at the hotel The Peninsula Paris in 2016 and 2017 , and in 2018 and 2019 at the Shangri La Hotel in Paris .",
      "Friday , or the eve of le Bal , is when the d\u00e9butantes come together for the first time . The makeup and hair styling sessions start at 9:00am . Then , the d\u00e9butantes don their dresses , long gloves , shoes , and jewels , and the individual and group photo sessions last for the rest of the day . On Friday evening , the d\u00e9butantes fathers and cavaliers take part in a waltz class with two teachers .",
      "The d\u00e9butantes have sessions with By Terry for makeup and Alexandre de Paris for hair .",
      "The d\u00e9butantes are introduced in alphabetical order on the arms of their cavaliers by journalist and author St\u00e9phane Bern . Then the dinner is served . After dinner , the d\u00e9butantes who are the most followed by the media open le Bal , followed by all of the fathers with their daughters .",
      "Opening dance .",
      "Each year since 2005 , there has been a d\u00e9butante who opens the dancing with a waltz .",

      "This opening dance is followed by a waltz with all of the fathers and d\u00e9butantes . The fathers then cede their daughters to the cavaliers , and the waltz is replaced with contemporary music with a live band . The debs then return their dresses and their jewels . The d\u00e9butantes and their cavaliers finish the evening out clubbing .",
      "The debutantes .",
      "The criteria for invitation are an attractive appearance , intelligence , and famous parents . They often come from families known in entertainment , business , or politics .",
      "As le Bal is also a couture event , the gowns are fashion show dresses and le Bals team endeavors to find the most suitable ones .",
      "From 2000 to 2003 , le Bal welcomed a winner from a contest held by the French magazine Jalouse each year . Each one was chosen based on a submitted application .",
      "Majority of the participants must familiarize themselves with wearing haute couture dresses , trading common teen fashion items for heels , tiaras and haute couture gowns worth up to \u00a330,000 each .",
      "In interviews , the d\u00e9butantes usually speak of the pleasure of wearing couture dresses , the charity aspect of the event , and the opportunity to meet girls from different countries .",
      "The cavaliers .",
      "Each d\u00e9butante is escorted by a cavalier . He may be by a young man of her own choosing , such as a brother , cousin , friend , or boyfriend . However , nearly half of the d\u00e9butantes , particularly those travelling from abroad dont bring their own cavaliers ; they rely instead on the organizers of le Bal to find a cavalier . As claimed by the organizer , Renouard , choosing the cavalier on their ages , the language they speak , their heights and possibly their backgrounds usually produces an optimal match for the d\u00e9butantes .",
      "Media coverage .",
      "Coverage often emphasizes the cachet of the event and its elegance . It has been claimed that Le Bal has really maintained its exclusivity ; all the top designers participate , and there have never been any sleazy photographs of the d\u00e9butantes ."

      "Vista House",
      "Vista House is a museum at Crown Point in Multnomah County , Oregon , that also serves as a memorial to Oregon pioneers and as a comfort station for travelers on the Historic Columbia River Highway . The site , situated on a rocky promontory , is above the Columbia River on the south side of the Columbia River Gorge . The octagonal stone building was designed by Edgar M . Lazarus in the style of Art Nouveau , and completed in 1918 after nearly two years of construction .",
      "In 2000 , restoration on the building began , and lasted five years . The Vista House is located within the Corbett locality , and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
      "History .",
      "Construction .",
      "The Vista House was designed by Edgar M . Lazarus , a renowned Oregon architect . With its high-grade marble interior and brass fixtures , some Oregonians at the time derided it as the $100,000 Outhouse during its construction . The initial funds for the project , allocated by the public , had totaled $3,812.35 . According to an itemized list published by the Oregon Historical Society , the building itself eventually cost approximately $70,000 , with an additional $9,000 for the accompanying rock wall ; $8,000 for paving and gradation ; $6,000 to the architect ; and $3,000 for other miscellaneous costs .",
      "The original idea for an observatory at the site came from Samuel Lancaster , the consulting engineer for the Columbia River Highway . Lancaster proposed an observatory from which the view both up and down the Columbia could be viewed in silent communion with the infinite . Construction of the Vista House began December 29 , 1916 , and was completed in 1918 and dedicated May 5 , 1918 . The dedication was overseen by Frank Branch Riley of Portland .",
      "Lancaster also suggested the name Vista House . The Vista House Association was established in 1974 to raise money for the project , composed of 52 Portland-area leaders . Funding subscriptions failed to raise sufficient money , and most of the cost of construction was paid by Multnomah County . Construction was supervised by John B . Yeon .",
      "Architectural design .",
      "Lazarus design incorporates elements of the Jugendstil , the German interpretation of Art Nouveau which had been popular in Europe in the late 19th century up to 1910 . The building is essentially a domed rotunda in diameter with an octagonal plan on a diameter base which houses toilets and a gift shop . The rotunda is high . Stairs lead from the rotunda to an elevated viewing platform at the base of the dome . The exterior is gray sandstone , with a green tile roof . The interior is extensively finished in marble , even in the toilets . The dome interior has bronze lining . The clerestory windows feature opalescent glass in a simple tracery pattern , with similar colored glass at the tops of the windows at the main level .",
      "Restoration efforts .",
      "The building is a popular tourist stop for drivers on the Historic Columbia River Highway . The building was refurbished and the interior restored to its 1916 appearance ; it reopened in 2005 after five years of restoration work . The roof was completely rebuilt with new tiles and an underlying membrane . Exterior restoration was complete by 2002 . Interior work comprised finish repair and replacement , upgrading the sewer system , and the installation of a geothermal heat pump system . The restoration also made Vista House accessible to the handicapped with a disappearing lift between levels . From the top of Vista House , which is accessible by stairs , one can view Portland and Vancouver , Washington to the west . Beacon Rock , on the Washington side of the gorge , is visible to the east .",
      "Vista House is owned by the Oregon Department of Transportation . It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 5 , 1974 . Crown Point was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1971 . Vista House is a major contributing structure in the Columbia River Highway National Historic Landmark ."

      "Henri Becquerel",
      "Antoine Henri Becquerel ( ; 15 December 1852 \u2013 25 August 1908 ) was a French engineer , physicist , Nobel laureate , and the first person to discover evidence of radioactivity . For work in this field he , along with Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie ( Marie Curie ) and Pierre Curie , received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics . The SI unit for radioactivity , the becquerel ( Bq ) , is named after him .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early life .",
      "Becquerel was born in Paris , France into a wealthy family which produced four generations of physicists : Becquerels grandfather ( Antoine C\u00e9sar Becquerel ) , father ( Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel ) , and son ( Jean Becquerel ) . Henri started off his education by attending the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand school , a prep school in Paris . He studied engineering at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and the \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es . In 1874 , Henri married Lucie Zo\u00e9 Marie Jamin , who would die while giving birth to their son , Jean . In 1890 he married Louise D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Lorieux .",
      "Career .",
      "In Becquerels early career , he became the third in his family to occupy the physics chair at the Mus\u00e9um National dHistoire Naturelle in 1892 . Later on in 1894 , Becquerel became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways before he started with his early experiments . Becquerels earliest works centered on the subject of his doctoral thesis : the plane polarization of light , with the phenomenon of phosphorescence and absorption of light by crystals . Early in his career , Becquerel also studied the Earths magnetic fields .",
      "Becquerels discovery of spontaneous radioactivity is a famous example of serendipity , of how chance favors the prepared mind . Becquerel had long been interested in phosphorescence , the emission of light of one color following a bodys exposure to light of another color . In early 1896 , there was a wave of excitement following Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgens discovery of X-rays on 5 January . During the experiment , R\u00f6ntgen found that the Crookes tubes he had been using to study cathode rays emitted a new kind of invisible ray that was capable of penetrating through black paper . Learning of R\u00f6ntgens discovery from earlier that year during a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences caused Becquerel to be interested , and soon began looking for a connection between the phosphorescence he had already been investigating and the newly discovered x-rays of R\u00f6ntgen , and thought that phosphorescent materials , such as some uranium salts , might emit penetrating X-ray-like radiation when illuminated by bright sunlight .",
      "By May 1896 , after other experiments involving non-phosphorescent uranium salts , he arrived at the correct explanation , namely that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself , without any need for excitation by an external energy source . There followed a period of intense research into radioactivity , including the determination that the element thorium is also radioactive and the discovery of additional radioactive elements polonium and radium by Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie and her husband Pierre Curie . The intensive research of radioactivity led to Becquerel publishing seven papers on the subject in 1896 . Becquerels other experiments allowed him to research more into radioactivity and figure out different aspects of the magnetic field when radiation is introduced into the magnetic field . When different radioactive substances were put in the magnetic field , they deflected in different directions or not at all , showing that there were three classes of radioactivity : negative , positive , and electrically neutral .",
      "As often happens in science , radioactivity came close to being discovered nearly four decades earlier in 1857 , when Abel Ni\u00e9pce de Saint-Victor , who was investigating photography under Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul , observed that uranium salts emitted radiation that could darken photographic emulsions . By 1861 , Niepce de Saint-Victor realized that uranium salts produce a radiation that is invisible to our eyes . Niepce de Saint-Victor knew Edmond Becquerel , Henri Becquerels father . In 1868 , Edmond Becquerel published a book , La lumi\u00e8re : ses causes et ses effets ( Light : Its causes and its effects ) . On page 50 of volume 2 , Edmond noted that Niepce de Saint-Victor had observed that some objects that had been exposed to sunlight could expose photographic plates even in the dark . Niepce further noted that on the one hand , the effect was diminished if an obstruction were placed between a photographic plate and the object that had been exposed to the sun , but \u2026 dun autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 , laugmentation deffet quand la surface insol\u00e9e est couverte de substances facilement alt\u00e9rables \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re , comme le nitrate durane \u2026 ( .. . on the other hand , the increase in the effect when the surface exposed to the sun is covered with substances that are easily altered by light , such as uranium nitrate .. . ) .",
      "Experiments .",
      "Describing them to the French Academy of Sciences on 27 February 1896 , he said :",
      "One wraps a Lumi\u00e8re photographic plate with a bromide emulsion in two sheets of very thick black paper , such that the plate does not become clouded upon being exposed to the sun for a day . One places on the sheet of paper , on the outside , a slab of the phosphorescent substance , and one exposes the whole to the sun for several hours . When one then develops the photographic plate , one recognizes that the silhouette of the phosphorescent substance appears in black on the negative . If one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen pierced with a cut-out design , one sees the image of these objects appear on the negative .. . One must conclude from these experiments that the phosphorescent substance in question emits rays which pass through the opaque paper and reduce silver salts .",
      "But further experiments led him to doubt and then abandon this hypothesis . On 2 March 1896 he reported :",
      "I will insist particularly upon the following fact , which seems to me quite important and beyond the phenomena which one could expect to observe : The same crystalline crusts [ of potassium uranyl sulfate ] , arranged the same way with respect to the photographic plates , in the same conditions and through the same screens , but sheltered from the excitation of incident rays and kept in darkness , still produce the same photographic images . Here is how I was led to make this observation : among the preceding experiments , some had been prepared on Wednesday the 26th and Thursday the 27th of February , and since the sun was out only intermittently on these days , I kept the apparatuses prepared and returned the cases to the darkness of a bureau drawer , leaving in place the crusts of the uranium salt . Since the sun did not come out in the following days , I developed the photographic plates on the 1st of March , expecting to find the images very weak . Instead the silhouettes appeared with great intensity .. . One hypothesis which presents itself to the mind naturally enough would be to suppose that these rays , whose effects have a great similarity to the effects produced by the rays studied by M . Lenard and M . R\u00f6ntgen , are invisible rays emitted by phosphorescence and persisting infinitely longer than the duration of the luminous rays emitted by these bodies . However , the present experiments , without being contrary to this hypothesis , do not warrant this conclusion . I hope that the experiments which I am pursuing at the moment will be able to bring some clarification to this new class of phenomena .",
      "Late career .",
      "Later in his life in 1900 , Becquerel measured the properties of Beta Particles , and he realized that they had the same measurements as high speed electrons leaving the nucleus . In 1901 Becquerel made the discovery that radioactivity could be used for medicine . Henri made this discovery when he left a piece of radium in his vest pocket and noticed that he had been burnt by it . This discovery led to the development of radiotherapy which is now used to treat cancer . Becquerel did not survive much longer after his discovery of radioactivity and died on 25 August 1908 , at the age of 55 , in Le Croisic , France . His death was caused by unknown causes , but was reported that he had developed serious burns on his skin , likely from the handling of radioactive materials .",
      "Honors and awards .",
      "In 1889 , Becquerel became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences . In 1900 , Becquerel won the Rumford Medal for his discovery of the radioactivity of uranium and he was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour . The Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities awarded him the Helmholtz Medal in 1901 . In 1902 , he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society . In 1903 , Henri shared a Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre Curie and Marie Curie for the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity . In 1905 , he was awarded the Barnard Medal by the U.S . National Academy of Sciences . In 1906 , Henri was elected Vice Chairman of the academy , and in 1908 , the year of his death , Becquerel was elected Permanent Secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences . During his lifetime , Becquerel was honored with membership into the Accademia dei Lincei and the Royal Academy of Berlin . Becquerel was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ( ForMemRS ) in 1908 . Becquerel has been honored with being the namesake of many different scientific discoveries . The SI unit for radioactivity , the becquerel ( Bq ) , is named after him . There is a crater named Becquerel on the Moon and also a crater named Becquerel on Mars . The uranium-based mineral becquerelite was named after Henri ."

Ephron said she wrote the part of Sally simulating an orgasm into the script per Meg Ryans suggestions . Additionally , the comment \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having\u201d said by a deli patron ( played by Rob Reiners real life mother Estelle Reiner ) watching the scene unfold nearby , was an idea from Billy Crystal .

      "St Lukes Anglican Church , Liverpool",
      "St Lukes Anglican Church is a heritage-listed Anglican church at Elizabeth Drive , Liverpool , Sydney , New South Wales , Australia . It was designed by Francis Greenway and built from 1818 to 1820 by James Smith . The property is owned by the Anglican Parish of Liverpool and is the oldest still existing Anglican church in Australia . It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 .",
      "History .",
      "Commissioned by Governor Lachlan Macquarie and designed by Francis Greenway , St Lukes Church was built in 1818\u20131819 as part of Macquaries establishment plan for the town of Liverpool . It was the smallest of the three major church designs commissioned by Macquarie from Greenway , the others being St James Church in Sydney and St Matthews Anglican Church in . A rectory was built about the same time but was replaced in 1840 .",
      "The site for Liverpool was marked out by Macquarie in 1810 . St Lukes was one of the original public buildings for the town . Its foundation stone was laid in 1818 . Its original builder Nathaniel Lucas died at an early stage and the job was taken over by James Smith . Rev . Robert Cartwright was the first Minister and the first service was held on St . Lukes Day , 18 October 1819 . Governor Macquarie attended a service in December 1820 . The building was not fully completed until the early 1820s . A rectory and school building , since demolished , were built close by .",
      "The oldest extant associated building on the site is the church hall , part of which dates from the 1840s .",
      "Rev . James Walker , described by William Woolls as one of the most learned men who ever came to the colonies , was an Oxford MA , had been chaplain at George Town , Van Diemens Land , before William Broughton appointed him to the new incumbency of Marsfield and the headmastership of The Kings School in 1843 . Walker had studied botany in Europe , but neither published , wrote , described any species , assembled any collection , or performed any task by which posterity is able to judge the quality of any botanical labour he undertook . Walkers stay in Parramatta was not long . He left in 1847 to become the rector of St . Lukes at Liverpool . It was from the Rev . Walker , Woolls said that he had first imbibed a taste for Australian botany . As a consequence , Woolls would earn for himself a place among the distinguished Australian botanists of the 19th century .",
      "The interior was completed in 1824 . Various additions and modifications were made to the church over the years . The chancel was added in 1857 , and the porch on the north side , formerly supported by four timber columns , was enclosed in 1860 . The vestries were added in the 1890s . A gallery was added at an unknown date , but was later removed . Greenways original portico on the north side was replaced by a brick porch in the 1870s but this , in turn , was replaced by a replica of the original portico in 1923 .",
      "An oversight was noticed during the 1956 centenary of consecration when it was seen that the church had not been consecrated in 1856 .",
      "The church was subject to a major restoration between 1975 and 1978 .",
      "Description .",
      "St Lukes Anglican Church is a Georgian brick church with tower , portico and additional chancel and vestries , set in open grounds in the centre of Liverpool .",
      "The clock in the tower is rare in Australia , being one of three Thwaites & Reed ( UK ) clocks in Australia , sent ( gifted ) by King George III ( one in Parramatta at the Parramatta Female Factory one in Hobart ) .",
      "The grounds contain some recent paving , but is otherwise mainly open and grassed , with mature lemon scented gums ( Corymbia citriodora ) , stringybarks ( Eucalyptus crebra ) , bloodwoods ( Corymbia sp. ) , and a kurrajong ( Brachychiton populneum ) .",
      "The church was reported to be in good condition as of 8 April 1998 .",
      "Heritage listing .",
      "St Lukes Anglican Church is evidence of Governor Macquaries initiatives in opening up settlement in New South Wales . It is one of the three oldest surviving Anglican churches in Australia , and a fine example of Francis Greenways public architecture in New South Wales . It is widely regarded with St James Church , Sydney and St Matthews Anglican Church , Windsor as a foundation colonial church .",
      "The clock in the tower is a Thwaites & Reed clock , one of five sent as a gift from King George IV ( the others being in the Parramatta Female Factory , St . Johns Parramatta , St . Matthews Windsor and in Hobart ) .",
      "St Lukes Anglican Church Group , as part of Macquaries original survey of Liverpool , demonstrates the history of the early settlement of the city and is a physical link to the character of the early township . It also demonstrates the history of the Anglican Church from the early establishment of the Colony from which period it has been a centre for local worship . The group is associated with many key Colonial figures , including the Architect Francis Greenway and is representative of his early colonial architectural style . Located within the heart of Liverpool the group is a historic , aesthetically pleasing landmark in an otherwise modernised city centre . It is one of only three surviving early Anglican churches in the country . There is the potential to gain more information on the site from further architectural , archaeological and documentary research .",
      "St Lukes Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 ."

      "Lothar von Trotha",
      "General Adrian Dietrich Lothar von Trotha ( 3 July 1848 \u2013 31 March 1920 ) was a German military commander during the European new colonial era . As a brigade commander of the East Asian Expedition Corps , he was involved in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China , commanding troops which made up the German contribution to the Eight-Nation Alliance . He later served as governor of German South West Africa and Commander in Chief of its colonial forces , in which role he suppressed a native rebellion during the Herero Wars . He was widely condemned for his brutality in the Herero Wars , particularly for his role in the genocide that led to the near-extermination of the Herero .",
      "Family .",
      "Lothar von Trotha belonged to a prominent Saxon noble family . He was married twice ; on 15 October 1872 he married Bertha Neumann , who died in 1905 . Following his retirement from the service , on 19 May 1912 , he married Lucy Goldstein-Brinckmann ( 1881\u20131958 ) , a second marriage for both , Lucy came from a family of converted Jews living in Frankfurt ; in London . Trotha had two sons , who died without descendants .",
      "Career .",
      "Born in Magdeburg , the capital of the Province of Saxony , Trotha joined the Prussian Army in 1865 and fought in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars , for which he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class . He married Bertha Neumann on 15 October 1872 .",
      "He was commander of the Lauenburgisches J\u00e4ger Bataillon Nr . 9 for two years in Ratzeburg before he was deployed to Africa in 1894 .",
      "Colonial service .",
      "In 1894 Trotha was appointed commander of the colonial forces in German East Africa and was ruthlessly successful in suppressing uprisings there , including the Wahehe Rebellion . While temporarily posted to Imperial China as Brigade Commander of the East Asian Expedition Corps , he was involved in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion . On 3 May 1904 he was appointed Commander in Chief of German South West Africa and was directed to crush the native Herero rebellion .",
      "In German South West Africa .",
      "Trotha arrived in South West Africa on 11 June 1904 , when the war against the Herero had been raging for five months . The German command up to that time had not had much success against the Herero guerrilla tactics . Initially , he too suffered losses .",
      "In October 1904 General von Trotha devised a new battle plan to end the uprisings by the Herero . At the Battle of Waterberg , he issued orders to encircle the Herero on three sides so that the only escape route was into the waterless Omaheke-Steppe , a western arm of the Kalahari Desert . The Herero fled into the desert and Trotha ordered his troops to poison water holes , erect guard posts along a 150-mile line and shoot on sight any Herero , be they man , woman or child , who attempted to escape . To make his attitude to the Herero absolutely clear , Trotha then issued the Vernichtungsbefehl , or extermination order :",
      "I , the great general of the German soldiers , send this letter to the Hereros . The Hereros are German subjects no longer . They have killed , stolen , cut off the ears and other parts of the body of wounded soldiers , and now are too cowardly to want to fight any longer . I announce to the people that whoever hands me one of the chiefs shall receive 1,000 marks , and 5,000 marks for Samuel Maherero . The Herero nation must now leave the country . If it refuses , I shall compel it to do so with the long tube ( cannon ) . Any Herero found inside the German frontier , with or without a gun or cattle , will be executed . I shall spare neither women nor children . I shall give the order to drive them away and fire on them . Such are my words to the Herero people .",
      "He further gave orders that :",
      "This proclamation is to be read to the troops at roll-call , with the addition that the unit that catches a captain will also receive the appropriate reward , and that the shooting at women and children is to be understood as shooting above their heads , so as to force them to run [ away ] . I assume absolutely that this proclamation will result in taking no more male prisoners , but will not degenerate into atrocities against women and children . The latter will run away if one shoots at them a couple of times . The troops will remain conscious of the good reputation of the German soldier .",
      "Trotha defended his policies later in his life . It was and is my policy to use force with terrorism and even brutality . An undisclosed German soldier was reported to have said of the massacres ...the death rattle of the dying and the shrieks of the mad...they echo in the sublime stillness of infinity .",
      "Trothas tactics were in marked distinction to that of the Herero leaders , who were , in the main , careful to ensure that only soldiers were attacked .",
      "Trothas methods caused a public outcry which led the Imperial Chancellor Bernhard von B\u00fclow to ask William II , German Emperor , to relieve Trotha of his command . This , however , was too late to help the Herero , as the few survivors had been herded into concentration camps and used as labour for German businesses , where many died of overwork , malnutrition or disease . Prior to the uprisings , there were estimated to be 80,000 Herero . The 1911 census records 15,000 .",
      "Trothas troops also routed the Nama . On 22 April 1905 he sent a message to the Nama , suggesting they surrender , and mentioning the fate of the Herero .",
      "Approximately 10,000 Nama died during the fighting , the remaining 9,000 were confined to concentration camps .",
      "On 19 November 1905 Lothar von Trotha returned to Germany and was appointed as an infantry general in 1910 . He died of typhoid fever ( bilious fever ) on 31 March 1920 in Bonn .",
      "Legacy .",
      "In 1933 , the Nazi authorities had named a street in Munich as von Trotha Stra\u00dfe . In 2006 the Munich city council officially decided to change the name of this street to Herero Stra\u00dfe in honour of the generals victims .",
      "Otjiwarongo , Namibia has a street named after von Trotha , since long before independence . In 2016 , calls to rename this street surfaced , and the municipality promised to initiate the renaming in 2017 .",
      "As General von Trotha has no living descendants , some of his distant relations traveled to Omaruru in October 2007 by invitation of the local Herero chiefs and publicly apologised for his actions . Wolf-Thilo von Trotha , a member of the family , said , We , the von Trotha family , are deeply ashamed of the terrible events that took place 100 years ago . Human rights were grossly abused that time .",
      "On 16 August 2004 the German government under Gerhard Schr\u00f6der officially apologized for the genocide , but rejected calls to pay reparations to the descendants of the Herero and Nama . We Germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by Germans at that time , said Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul , Germanys development aid minister . In addition , she admitted the massacres were equivalent to genocide . The two countries have generally had a good relationship since and Germany has tailored economic and political packages for the people of Namibia .",
      "In May 2021 , the German government officially recognized the genocide and agreed to pay \u20ac1.1 billion over 30 years to fund projects in communities that were impacted by the genocide ."

      "Daniel Cottier",
      "Daniel Cottier ( 1838\u20131891 ) was an artist and designer born in Anderston , Glasgow , Scotland . His work was said to be influenced by the writing of John Ruskin , the paintings of the Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the work of William Morris . He painted allegorical figures in the Pre-Raphaelite style of Rossetti and Sir Edward Burne-Jones . Cottier is considered to be an important influence on Louis Comfort Tiffany and also is credited with introducing the Aesthetic movement to America and Australia .",
      "Cottier was interested in glass , furniture , ceramic manufacture , and interior design . His art furnishing business opened branches in Edinburgh , Glasgow and London between 1864 and 1869 , and then in 1873 he opened more branches in New York , Sydney and Melbourne . In the United States he is seen as a harbinger of aestheticism\u2026.and a profound influence on American decoration . And the same can be said of Scotland where he also exported the Aesthetic Movement to Scotland via his many professional and business contacts which he had made during his training and early career in Glasgow , Edinburgh and Aberdeen . So , by the time he moved to London in 1869 , Cottier was already part of an influential and avart-garde group of designers\u2014many of them also expatriate Scots\u2014who were to establish the Aesthetic Movement in England .",
      "Family Life .",
      "Daniel Cottier was born in 1838 , the son of Margaret McLean ( 1807 - 1885 ) and Daniel Cottier ( 1761 - 1843 ) , a master mariner . In the Census of 1841 , he is recorded with his family in Carrick Street , off the Broomielaw in Glasgow . By 1851 , he was working as an apprentice coach painter , living in North Woodside Road . In 1861 , he was boarding in Francis Street , St Pancras , London , working as a glass designer . In 1866 , he married Marion Millar Field , of Edinburgh , and in 1867 , their daughter , Isabella was born . They had four children , Archibald ( 1868 ) who died of whooping cough aged 20 months , William ( 1869 ) , Alexander and Margaret .",
      "Training .",
      "His training began as an apprentice to glazing and decorating firm in Glasgow in the 1850s , first with the firm of David Keir ( 1802\u201365 ) , then with John Cairney & Co ( 1828\u201365 ) . Cairneys circle included the architect and designer Alexander Greek Thomson ( 1817\u201375 ) , who was of international stature and one of the most original interpreters of the Greek Revival style . When Thomson was designing a building , he included coloured decoration , furniture and carpets in his drawings . His ornamentation and colour schemes also drew from Egyptian , Assyrian , and Persian cultures . Cottier in all probability came into contact , whilst an apprentice at Cairneys , with this unified eclecticism of Aesthetic Movement interiors of the 1870s .",
      "Cottier subsequently worked for the stainer James Ballantine in Edinburgh , and attended evening classes at the Trustees Academy , at which Ornamental Design was taught . Around 1859 he went to London , where he may have worked for the stained glass makers , Ward & Hughes , while attending evening classes at the Working Mens College at 31 Red Lion Square in the East End . Here he heard lectures given by the critic John Ruskin ( 1819\u20131900 ) and received drawing lessons from the artist Ford Madox Brown ( 1821\u201393 ) . Cottier could not have been closer to the Pre-Raphaelites or to the stirrings of the Aesthetic Movement : in 1861 William Morris ( 1834\u201396 ) opened his decorating and furnishing partnership across from the College , at 8 Red Lion Square . This may have exposed Cottier to the colour theories being developed by Morris , whose subtle and resonant tertiary hues were beginning to replace the archaeologically inspired mid-century primaries favoured by designers such as Thomson .",
      "In 1862 Cottier returned to Scotland to accept an appointment as manager of Field & Allan , a firm of slaters , glaziers and decorators based in Edinburgh and Leith ( 1797\u20131910 ) . Here he oversaw the glazing and decoration of Peddie and Kinnears Pilrig Parish Church , Leith ( c . 1862\u201363 ) . The surviving geometric glass cycle , bold and vigorous , was based on medieval grisaille work . It shows that by now Cottier had developed a keen sense of colour harmony , heavily reliant on the juxtaposition of contrasting primary or tertiary colours .",
      "After managing Field & Allan for two years , Cottier felt sufficiently confident to open his own business in Edinburgh aged 26 . He shared the top floor of 24 George Street with the architects Campbell Douglas and J . J . Stevenson . Cottier persuaded Andrew Wells ( 1845\u20131915 ) , his talented young assistant at Field & Allan , to join the new venture , together with Stephen Adam ( 1848\u20131910 ) from Ballantine & Co , and Charles Gow ( 1830\u20131891 ) . However , Cottiers connection with Field & Allan did not end completely : he married Marion , the late William Fields daughter , in Edinburgh on 15 June 1866 .",
      "Cottier and Company .",
      "At the 1867 Paris International Exhibition , Cottiers armorial window received a prize , and was praised as magnificent \u2026superb harmony of colours \u2026the finest ornamental window in the Exhibition . Encouraged by his growing success , in 1869 he moved the centre of his activities to London where , at 2 Langham Place , in partnership with Brydon , Wallace and John Bennett , he established Cottier and Company , which advertised as art furniture makers , mural decorators , and glass and tile painters . Cottier may have been drawn to London by the artistic community of expatriate Scots who had settled there , referred to as the London brethren . However , Cottier & Cos order books continued to be dominated by commissions in Scotland , and the studio expanded . Around 1871 Norman McLeod Macdougall ( 1852\u20131939 ) followed Cottier to London , where he became the chief glass painter and latterly designer . Cottier also began to visit Europe as he developed an interest in art dealing , which brought him into contact with Vincent van Gogh and Dutch artist , Matthew Maris ( 1839\u20131917 ) , who arrived in London to work for Cottier around 1872 . Maris , who accompanied him on visits to Norway and elsewhere , has been credited as the designer of some of Cottiers most successful windows of the 1870s . Certainly , the figures on a window such as the Musician Angels at St Machars Cathedral , Aberdeen ( 1873 ) , assume the strong contraposto poses which often appear in Mariss drawings . Maris also painted panels for Cottier , but as he found the watery consistency of glass paints made them difficult to use , he later explained that the only things that exist by my hand ( from Cottiers studio ) I painted with oil colours against the light .",
      "Van Gogh visited Cottiers London showroom in 1876 and there he recalled seeing , Sketches for two church windows . In the middle of one was a portrait of a middle-aged lady\u2014oh , such a noble face\u2014with the words Thy will be done . Elsewhere van Gogh noted , When there is style in a drawing he ( Cottier ) likes it well enough .",
      "As well as capitalising on a taste for all things Aesthetic in Britain , Cottier helped to establish the Aesthetic Movement abroad . In 1873 he opened a New York branch at 144 Fifth Avenue . In New York , Boston and elsewhere , Cottier & Co supplied ecclesiastical and domestic stained glass imported from the London workshop , which came to employ over a hundred men . He also supplied a variety of other goods , from gasoliers to Oriental Carpetings , as well as decorating interiors and dealing in pictures and antiques , and Cottiers taste in Aesthetic furnishings and modern paintings spread across the States as far as Portland , Oregon . He encouraged native artists such as Albert Pinkham Ryder ( 1847\u20131917 ) . Cottier remained an active designer on several American project between 1873\u20139 .",
      "In the 1880s Cottier collaborated with the stained glass artists Louis Comfort Tiffany ( 1848\u20131933 ) and John La Farge ( 1835\u20131910 ) . An important window made in about 1877 for the main hall of the Newport , Rhode Island , house of William Sherman ( 1843\u20131912 ) , formerly attributed to La Farge , is now considered to be the work of Cottier .",
      "Cottiers transatlantic experiences may have crossed over into his Scottish commissions , such as the Baptism of Christ in Paisley Abbey , Renfreshire ( c . 1880 ) which features an unusually bold exercise in depicting water-reeds blowing in the wind which seems to anticipate the landscape glass that Tiffany later developed in America . Cottier played a part in the strong late-nineteenth century ties between progressive Scottish and American glass , a trend which later resulted in American-developed techniques , particularly the exploration of streaky and opalescent glass , influencing the glass produced by the Glasgow School in the 1890s .",
      "In 1873 Cottier began to export the Aesthetic Movement to Australia with the opening of a branch in Sydney in partnership with John Lamb Lyon ( 1835\u20131916 ) , a fellow Scot with whom he had trained in Glasgow and London . Cottier made at least three trips to Australia between 1873 and 1890 , but Lyon largely ran the business there . Cottiers contribution to the Australian branch was to supply Lyon with his talented assistants , Gow and Wells , who acted as its chief designers from the mid-1870s to the mid-1890s . Under the direction of Lyon and Wells , the firm of Cottier , Lyon & Co decorated a number of important private residences , churches , and public buildings , all in the latest London style , with windows initially imported from the London workshop .",
      "Death .",
      "As a result of his business interests abroad , Cottier became increasingly known as an art dealer . He began to amass a large private collection of paintings , apparently to supply a legacy for his family , as his recurrent rheumatic fever made him ineligible for life insurance . Cottier died of a heart attack on April 15 , 1891 , aged 53 while visiting Jacksonville , Florida for health reasons . He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx , New York City . His firm survived in New York as picture dealers until 1915 .",
      "Legacy .",
      "By the time of his death , Cottier had undoubtedly contributed as much to the propagation of the Aesthetic Movement in Britain as he had abroad . Stephen Adam left Cottier & Co in 1870 to establish his own firm in Glasgow together with David Small ( 1846\u20131927 ) . For the next two decades Adam & Small capitalised on the demand which Cottier had created for Aesthetic glass by producing a stream of confident windows dominated by Adams figure drawings , which were based on Hart and Moores Neo-Classical style . In 1873 Adam collaborated with Wells , shortly before he left for Australia , on the decoration and glazing of Belhaven Parish Church , Glasgow . Adams glass at Belhaven borrowed heavily from the repertoire which he had learned from Cottier , including Japanese-style foliage , quarries and sunflowers , with figurative panels based on Millais Parables , which may have been adapted from cartoons of identical windows produced in Cottiers studio .",
      "Cottier emerges as an important figure in pioneering the Aesthetic Movement in Britain , in areas beyond the glass-painting with which he is most often associated . He was a talented colourist and ornamentalist . He oversaw the production of a range of glass , furniture , ceramics and interior schemes which , incorporating the designs of Godwin , Talbert , Moyr , Smith , Moore and others , testify to his position in avant-garde London design circles on the 1870s .",
      "Prudhoe Hall ( built 1868\u201370 ) and the Catholic Church of our Lady and St Cuthbert in Prudhoe ( built 1890\u201391 , but incorporating the Cottier windows from an earlier smaller chapel built 1868\u201370 ) have some of Cottiers earliest stained glass . Why did Matthew Liddell commission Daniel Cottier to design the stained glass windows in both the main hall and the original chapel ? His architect , Archibald Dunn , presumably would have been impressed by the fact that Cottier had recently won a prize for the superb harmony of colours in his armorial window at the 1867 Paris International Exhibition . Indeed , Cottier has referred to his Paris prize in the graphite border of the large window in the main hall of Prudhoe Hall .",
      "The stained glass in the small original chapel , which was opened on 19 October 1870 , was eventually incorporated in the enlarged church of 1891 and then subsequently moved again a mile into the town of Prudhoe in 1904-5 , when the Liddell family moved away from the area and could no longer support the Catholic mission , which Matthew Liddell had begun in 1870 . The black-and-white photographs of the first chapel at Prudhoe Hall in Father Zielinskis book , The Church That Moved , clearly show exactly the same windows containing the Cottier glass that have been retained in the larger church that replaced it . This means that the Cottier windows have been moved twice from their original site , and this would explain the necessity for so much extra remedial lead-work within some of the panes of glass , presumably repairing damage caused by two removals and two re-installations .",
      "The small windows at Prudhoe Hall depicting idyllic naturalistic scenes of a rising sun over a river are especially beautiful and seem to have a strong similarity to the work of Louis Comfort Tiffany . Made around 1870 , they pre-date by ten years or more the collaboration between Cottier and Tiffany in the 1880s in America . The swaying reeds in particular would seem to suggest that Cottier may well have been a significant influence on Tiffany before Tiffany returned the compliment as it were , and Cottier brought some of his ideas back into his own artistic creations in Scotland .",
      "There are several Cottier stained glass windows and a decorative interior scheme situated in Glasgows West End which are cared for by Four Acres Charitable Trust ( FACT ) . FACT was founded in 1983 and acquired Cottiers Theatre , then Dowanhill Church , in 1984 . The former Dowanhill Church , built in 1865 by William Leiper ( 1839-1916 ) and is an internationally important Category \u2018A\u2019 listed building due to its decorative scheme designed by Cottier . The Theatre also contains several stained glass windows by Cottier including Miriam and David ( 1867 ) and a rose window . FACT works to return important redundant Victorian buildings to a meaningful use and restore them in accordance with the highest conservation standards .",
      "Four fine examples of his work may be found in Holy Trinity Church , Nice , France .",

      "Central European University",
      "Central European University ( CEU ) is a private research university accredited in Austria , Hungary , and the United States , with campuses in Vienna and Budapest . The university is known for its strength in the social sciences and humanities , low student-faculty ratio , and international student body . A central tenet of the universitys mission is the promotion of open societies , as a result of its close association with the Open Society Foundations . CEU is one of eight members comprising the CIVICA Alliance , a group of European higher education institutions in the social sciences , humanities , business management and public policy , such as Sciences Po ( France ) , The London School of Economics and Political Science ( UK ) , and the Stockholm School of Economics ( Sweden ) .",
      "CEU was founded in 1991 by hedge fund manager , political activist , and billionaire philanthropist George Soros , who provided it with an $880 million endowment , making the university one of the wealthiest in Europe , especially on a per-student basis . The university was founded in Central Europe because of a perceived need for an independent and international university for the region , in light of the fall of the Socialist Bloc and concomitant democratisation .",
      "The university is composed of 13 academic departments and 17 research centers , in addition to the School of Public Policy and the Doctoral School of Political Science , Public Policy and International Relations . CEUs alumni include notable politicians , academics , and activists , such as former President of Georgia , Giorgi Margvelashvili and L\u00edvia J\u00e1r\u00f3ka , the first Romani woman ever elected to the European Parliament . CEU was the highest-ranked university in Hungary before it was forced to leave the country .",
      "On 3 December 2018 , CEU announced it would cease operations in Budapest and relocate to Vienna after the Hungarian governments refusal to sign an agreement allowing the university to continue operations in Hungary .",
      "This withdrawal is the result of a long legal battle between the university and Viktor Orb\u00e1ns government , and is set in the wider context of contemporary Hungarian politics . This situation has invited discourse regarding academic freedom in Hungary , and spurred widespread protests in favour of CEU . On 6 October 2020 , the European Court of Justice ruled that the Lex CEU was incompatible with European Union law .",
      "History .",
      "History of the CEU , 1989\u20132017 .",
      "CEU evolved from a series of lectures held at the IUC in Dubrovnik , Yugoslavia , ( now Croatia ) . In the Spring of 1989 , as historical change was gathering momentum in the region the need for a new , independent , international university was being considered . The minutes of the gathering held in April 1989 records a discussion among scholars such as Rudolf Andorka , , M\u00e1rton Tardos , Istv\u00e1n Tepl\u00e1n , Tibor V\u00e1mos and Mikl\u00f3s V\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi from Budapest , William Newton-Smith and Kathleen Wilkes from Oxford , Jan Havranek , Michal Illner and Ji\u0159\u00ed Ko\u0159alka from Prague , Krzysztof Michalski and W\u0142odzimierz Siwi\u0144ski from Warsaw . In 1989\u20131990 , a serious attempt was undertaken to establish Central European University in the Slovak capital of Bratislava . But it fell through , due to nationalist politicians opposition .",
      "The University was founded in 1991 in response to the fall of the Socialist Bloc . The founding vision was to create a university dedicated to examining the contemporary challenges of open societies and democratization . The initial aim was to create a Western-modeled yet distinctly Central European institution that would foster inter-regional cooperation and educate a new corps of regional leaders to help usher in democratic transitions across the region . CEU was set up in Budapest , Prague , and Warsaw . It was originally located mostly in Prague , but because of political and financial conflict between its founder and [ the ] Czech government , represented by then premier minister Vaclav Klaus , it was moved to Budapest .",
      "In its second decade , CEU broadened its focus from regional to global , with a special emphasis on democracy promotion and human rights around the world . It has since developed a distinct academic approach , combining regional studies with an international perspective , emphasizing comparative and interdisciplinary research in order to generate new scholarship and policy initiatives , and to promote good governance and the rule of law . CEU has extended its outreach and financial aid programs to certain areas of the developing world .",
      "CEU began the regions first masters degree programs in gender studies and environmental sciences . The CEU Center for Media , Data and Society is the leading center of research on media , communication , and information policy in the region .",
      "On 14 October 2007 George Soros stepped down as Chairman of CEU Board . Leon Botstein ( President of Bard College , New York ) , who had previously served as the Vice-Chair of the Board , was elected as new Chairman for a two-year term . George Soros is a Life-CEU Trustee and serves as Honorary Chairman of the Board .",
      "On 1 August 2009 Rector Yehuda Elkana was succeeded by human rights leader and legal scholar John Shattuck . On 5 May 2016 , it was announced that Michael Ignatieff would succeed Shattuck , becoming the fifth president and rector of the university . Ignatieffs inauguration took place at the Universitys new auditorium on 21 October 2017 .",
      "CEU and the Amendment to the National Higher Education law .",
      "The announcement and CEUs initial reactions .",
      "On 28 March 2017 , Hungarian Minister of Human Resources Zolt\u00e1n Balog , also responsible for education , submitted a bill to Parliament to amend Act CCIV of 2011 on National Higher Education . The bill aims to introduce new regulations for foreign-operating universities , several of which affect CEU . Notably , such universities could only operate if the Hungarian government has an agreement with the universitys other country of operation ( concerning CEU , the agreement is between the State of New York and the city of Budapest ) . In addition , universities operating outside of the European Union should have a campus in their other country of operation , where comparable degree programs would be offered ( in 2017 it was not the case for CEU ) . Furthermore , both existing and new non-EU academic staff would be required to apply for working permits . This requirement is seen by critics as placing CEU at a particular disadvantage , given that it relies largely on non-EU faculty . Finally , the law would also prohibit both the American and Hungarian entities from sharing the same name .",
      "CEU issued a statement expressing its opposition to the bill , noting that these amendments [ to Act CCIV of 2011 on National Higher Education ] would make it impossible for the University to continue its operations as an institution of higher education in Budapest , CEUs home for 25 years , and that CEU is in full conformity with Hungarian law .",
      "The same day , the pro-government news website Origo.hu published an article asserting that CEU , to which it referred as Soros University ( George Soros being its founder and main benefactor , and also known as an opponent of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party ) , operated unlawfully in Hungary , citing regulatory infractions . The article also referred to a report prepared by Hungarys Educational Authority , which revealed that 28 universities , including CEU , were being investigated for operating unlawfully in Hungary . CEU issued a statement in response to the article , claiming the allegations of cheating and regulatory infractions constituted defamations and libel , and threatened to sue the website if the article was not corrected .",
      "On 29 March 2017 , Michael Ignatieff , the President and Rector of CEU and Pro-Rector for Hungarian Affairs Zsolt Enyedi and Pro-Rector for Social Sciences and Humanities \u00c9va Fodor held a press conference . Ignatieff said , among other things , that the legislation tabled by the Hungarian government relating to higher education is targeted and discriminatory , attacks the CEU , and is an unacceptable assault on our academic freedom , and the academic freedom of Hungarian higher education in general . Later , Ignatieff and Enyedi met Secretary of State for Education L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Palkovics . CEU issued a statement thereafter , calling for the government to withdraw this legislation and enter into negotiations to find a solution .",
      "On 31 March 2017 , Viktor Orb\u00e1n stated in an interview to public radio that the future of Soros University ( referring to George Soros , founder and main benefactor of CEU ) depended on US-Hungarian talks . He said that CEU was cheating by awarding both Hungarian and American degrees , despite not operating abroad . This was a breach of Hungarian regulations , which gave an unfair advantage to CEU over the other 21 foreign universities in Hungary . In response to those claims , CEU issued a statement rejecting the suggestion that it was cheating and in breach of Hungarian regulations . Indeed , according to CEU , no laws in effect required universities such as CEU to also operate in their countries of origin . However , Szilard Nemeth , vice chairman of Fidesz was more blunt , stating that civil society groups with funding from Soros should be swept out of Hungary .",
      "Media reactions .",
      "According to Marc Santora of The New York Times , Mr . Orban has long viewed the school as a bastion of liberalism , presenting a threat to his vision of creating an illiberal democracy , and his desire to shut it down was only deepened by its association with Mr . Soros , a philanthropist who was born in Hungary . [ He ] has spent years demonizing Mr . Soros , a Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary , accusing him of seeking to destroy European civilization by promoting illegal immigration , and often tapping into anti-Semitic tropes .",
      "Zack Beauchamp of Vox wrote that The university was a casualty of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s turn toward authoritarianism , his development of a quietly repressive system that I\u2019ve termed soft fascism . CEU , a university dedicated to liberal principles and founded by Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros , posed a threat to Orb\u00e1ns ideological project . So he put in place a set of characteristically sneaky regulations aimed at forcing out CEU without needing to formally ban them , eventually crushing the universitys ability to operate .",
      "Griff Witte of The Washington Post commented that [ CEU ] has become the prime target of Orbans campaign to dismantle Europes multicultural , tolerant liberalism and cement a culture that is unapologetically Christian , conservative and nationalist .",
      "Author Tibor Fischer expressed his support for the legislation passed on the initiative of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1ns government , which affects CEU as well as all other Hungarian universities . Fischer defended Orban against charges of antisemitism , indicating that the government introduced Holocaust education into schools , passed a Holocaust denial law and...financed Son of Saul , a film about Auschwitz that [ went on to win ] an Oscar . He specified that he opposes the practice whereby the CEU , being registered in New York City , can issue a diploma accredited in the United States but without actually operating a campus in America within the provisions of the law as every other Hungarian campus , a situation that he named as CEU students getting a double bubble .",
      "Expressions of support for CEU .",
      "On the same day , the United States government ( Trump administration ) released a statement expressing concern about the proposed legislation , which would negatively affect or even lead to the closure of Central European University ( CEU ) in Budapest , and urging the Hungarian government not to take any legislative action that would compromise CEUs operations or independence .",
      "Hungarys ombudsman for educational rights Lajos Aary-Tamas called the amendment to the Higher Education Law discriminatory against CEU , and said that during his 17 years in office he had never received any complaint about CEUs legal status . Hungarian EU Commissioner for Education , Culture , Multilingualism and Youth Tibor Navracsics , and former President of Hungary L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00f3lyom also expressed support .",
      "Academics and academic institutions from Hungary , Latvia , Poland , Russia , Romania , Germany , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom , the United States , and other countries have expressed support for CEU . CEU itself has started a campaign of support , with the slogans #aCEUvalvagyok Central European University in Hungarian and #IstandwithCEU Central European University in English . The campaign uses social media to call on supporters to express their solidarity to CEU and write to Hungarian representatives .",
      "On 2 April 2017 , a protest was held in the form of a walk from Budapests Corvinus University to Parliament , passing by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University and CEU . The demonstration brought together thousands of protesters according to Reuters , with protest speeches held by both CEU and foreign academics and activists , and was broadcast live on Facebook by H\u00edr TV .",
      "In the wake of the new Hungarian legislation , the Czech minister of Finance Andrej Babi\u0161 proposed the CEU be moved to Prague , Czech Republic , offering particular buildings in the centre of the city that the university might use .",
      "Legal action by CEU and acceleration of the legislative procedure .",
      "On 3 April 2017 , CEU submitted a legal memorandum to the Hungarian Parliament , raising substantial issues about the legality and constitutionality of the proposed amendment to Act CCIV of 2011 on national higher education , and pledged to continue to contest this law using all available legal means in Hungary and in the EU .",
      "On the same day , the Hungarian parliament decided to debate and vote on the draft bill the following day , after a request by Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semj\u00e9n , also head of the Christian Democrats , the junior party in the government coalition . Semj\u00e9n said his request was justified by government interests to pass the law early .",
      "Withdrawal from Hungary and government reaction .",
      "On 3 December 2018 the university announced it would relocate the majority of its operations to Vienna in September 2019 , after the Hungarian governments refusal to sign an agreement allowing it to continue teaching its US-accredited programs in Hungary . Less than one fifth of CEUs programs , that are locally accredited , would remain in Budapest . The university retains accreditation as a Hungarian university and has sought to continue teaching and research activity in Budapest as long as possible , with current students completing their studies in Budapest .",
      "After failing to promote a deal between the US and Hungary that would keep the CEU in Budapest , US Ambassador to Budapest , David Cornstein said on 30 November that the whole issue had to do with [ Orban and Soros ] . It had nothing to do with academic freedom or civil liberties .",
      "Academics .",
      "As of 2019 , 1217 students were enrolled in the university , of which 962 were international students , making the student body the fourth most international in the world . CEU offers doctoral programmes in thirteen different subjects and masters programmes in thirty-seven different subjects , in addition to two interdisciplinary bachelors programmes . All programmes at CEU have a heavy research focus , and all courses are delivered in small , seminar-style classes , emphasising the low student-faculty ratio .",
      "Rankings .",
      "To date , as an exclusively postgraduate university , CEU has not been eligible for general world university rankings . However , two new bachelors degree programs were introduced in the 2020-2021 academic year , and this should soon be reflected in new ranking tables .",
      "Regardless of this limitation due to the intentionally small size and specialised nature of the university , CEU has consistently performed well in subject rankings produced by various leading publishers , and all courses at the university are highly competitive .",
      "The university is ranked 25th worldwide in the field of politics and international studies , 14th worldwide for academic reputation in the same subject , 35th worldwide for philosophy , 66th worldwide for sociology in the 2021 QS World University Rankings . On the same ranking system , the University is also ranked for history ( 51-100 ) , social policy and administration ( 51-100 ) , legal studies ( 101\u2013150 ) , arts and humanities ( 118 ) economics ( 151\u2013200 ) , and social sciences ( 180 ) . Additionally , despite its small and young programs of fewer than a hundred students , the Economics department of the university was recently ranked eighth in Europe by the European Research Council ( ERC ) , based on research excellence .",
      "CEUs Business Analytics Programme is ranked as the 16th best in Europe by the QS Masters in Business Analytics Rankings 2019 , and",
      "the university offers the thirteenth best MBA program in Europe , according to the QS TOPMBA survey 2012 . In this survey , CEUs Business School is consistently placed among the twenty best business schools in Europe .",
      "According to a study published by German newspaper Die Zeit , the CEU Department of Political Science is among the top five political science departments in Europe .",
      "CEUs Department of Legal Studies was ranked first in Central Europe by the Czech newspaper , Lidov\u00e9 noviny . The survey included Austrian , Czech , German , Hungarian , Polish , and Slovak universities .",
      "A recent report prepared by the Magyar Rektori Konferencia stated that CEU faculty has the highest number of international publications per capita ( recorded in the Web of Science ) among Hungarian universities . The same applies to the amount of research support grants received in the framework of EUs Sixth and Seventh Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development . In the recent round of the European Research Council Starting Investigator Grant \u2013 the most prestigious grant for young researchers in Europe \u2013 Central-East European countries received a total of eight grants . Of the three that came to Hungary ( the highest number of among C/EE countries ) , two were awarded to CEU faculty .",

      "Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel",
      "Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel is a Spanish mission in San Miguel , San Luis Obispo County , California . It was established on July 25 , 1797 by the Franciscan order , on a site chosen specifically due to the large number of Salinan Indians that inhabited the area , whom the Spanish priests wanted to evangelize .",
      "The mission remains in use as a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey . After being closed to the public for six years due to the 2003 San Simeon earthquake , the church reopened on September 29 , 2009 . Inside the church are murals designed by Esteban Munras .",
      "The mission was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and was named to a National Historic Landmark in 2006 . Of Californias missions , it is one that retains more than most of its layout and buildings , including a portion of its neophyte village .",
      "History .",
      "Father Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n and Father Buenaventura Sitjar founded the mission on July 25 , 1797 , making it the sixteenth California mission . Its location between Mission San Luis Obispo and Mission San Antonio de Padua provided a stop on the trip that had previously taken two days .",
      "A temporary wooden church was built with living quarters . The site was chosen as it was close to a Salinan Indian village called Vahca . In 1798 the small chapel was replaced . From 1816 to 1818 a new church was constructed with a tile roof and courtyard .",
      "Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel land was sold off after the Mexican secularization act of 1833 . The William Reed family lived in the buildings until 1848 , when they were murdered by a band of thieves . The killers were tracked down by a posse in the foothills of Santa Barbara . Two thieves died in the ensuing battle , and the other three were tried and executed by firing squad . Upon secularization , the mission began to decay . Padre Abella , the last Franciscan at San Miguel , died in July , 1841 .",
      "In 1859 the U.S . government returned the mission to the Catholic Church . But with the buildings in poor condition , no priests were assigned to the mission ; buildings were rented to some small businesses . In 1878 the Church reactivated the mission , and Rev . Philip Farrelly took up residence as First Pastor of Mission San Miguel . In 1928 the mission was returned to the Franciscan Padres , the same group who had founded the mission in 1797 .",
      "Features .",
      "- The Mission Arcade , a series of 12 arches , is original . The variety of shapes and sizes was planned and the Mission was known for this arcade .",
      "- The first chapel on the site was replaced within a year of its construction by a larger adobe chapel , which burned in the 1806 fire .",
      "- The current mission church was built between 1816 and 1818 . It is 144 long , wide , and high .",
      "- The cemetery adjacent to the church holds the remains of 2,249 Native Americans listed in the Missions burial records .",
      "- The painted walls inside the church are the original artwork by artist Esteban Munras and other Salinan artists .",
      "Mission bells .",
      "Bells were vitally important to daily life at any mission . The bells were rung at mealtimes , to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services , during births and funerals , to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary , and at other times ; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells .",
      "Associated structures .",
      "The Rios-Caledonia Adobe was built in 1835 just south of the San Miguel Mission as a home for the overseer of Mission lands . This historic site is well preserved with the original Inn and Stagecoach stop now a museum and small gift shop . A building was added in 1930 that is now a unique history research library . The grounds are maintained by San Luis Obispo County Parks with picnic sites and restrooms available .",
      "The Historic Rios-Caledonia Adobe is a California Historical Landmark ( #936 ) and is listed on the National Park Service\u2019s National Register of Historic Places ( #71000190 ) ."

      "William Dwight Whitney",
      "William Dwight Whitney ( ; February 9 , 1827June 7 , 1894 ) was an American linguist , philologist , and lexicographer known for his work on Sanskrit grammar and Vedic philology as well as his influential view of language as a social institution . He was the first president of the American Philological Association and editor-in-chief of The Century Dictionary .",
      "Life .",
      "William Dwight Whitney was born in Northampton , Massachusetts on February 9 , 1827 . His father was Josiah Dwight Whitney ( 1786\u20131869 ) of the New England Dwight family . His mother was Sarah Williston ( 1800\u20131833 ) of Easthampton , Massachusetts .",
      "Whitney entered Williams College at fifteen , graduating in 1845 . He continued studying and worked at a bank in Northampton for several years . He was at first interested in natural sciences , and assisted his older brother Josiah Whitney on a geological survey of the Lake Superior region in 1849 , having charge of the botany , the barometrical observations and the accounts . On this expedition , he began the study of Sanskrit in his leisure hours . Around this time Whitney was living at Yale University in Connecticut .",
      "In 1850 , Whitney left the United States to study philology , and especially Sanskrit , in Germany . There , he spent his winters at Berlin studying under Franz Bopp and Albrecht Weber , and his summers were devoted to research under Rudolph von Roth at T\u00fcbingen . It was during his time in Germany that Whitney began a major life project , preparation of an edition and translation of the Atharva-veda .",
      "He gained wide reputation for his scholarship in the field . In 1853 , Yale University offered Whitney a position as Professor of Sanskrit , a position made just for him and the first of its kind in the United States . It was not until 1861 , however , that he received his doctoral degree from the University of Breslau . He also taught modern languages at the Sheffield Scientific School , and served as secretary to the American Oriental Society from 1857 until he became its president in 1884 . The American Philosophical Society elected Whitney to membership in 1863 .",
      "On August 28 , 1856 , Whitney married Elizabeth Wooster Baldwin . She was the daughter of Roger Sherman Baldwin , US Senator and Governor of the State of Connecticut .",
      "They had six children :",
      "1 . Edward Baldwin Whitney was born August 16 , 1857 , became Assistant US Attorney General , and had son mathematician Hassler Whitney .",
      "2 . Williston Clapp Whitney was born April 2 , 1859 but died March 11 , 1861 .",
      "3 . Marian Parker Whitney was born February 6 , 1861 , became a professor of German at Vassar College and trustee of Connecticut College for Women",
      "4 . Roger Sherman Baldwin Whitney was born January 6 , 1863 , but died January 17 , 1874 .",
      "5 . Emily Henrietta Whitney was born August 29 , 1864 .",
      "6 . Margaret Dwight Whitney was born November 19 , 1866 .",
      "He died at his home , on Whitney Avenue , on June 7 , 1894 .",
      "Career .",
      "Whitney revised definitions for the 1864 edition of Websters American Dictionary , and in 1869 became a founder and first president of the American Philological Association . In the same year he also became Yales professor of comparative philology . Whitney also gave instruction in French and German in the college until 1867 , and in the Sheffield scientific school until 1886 . He wrote metrical translations of the Vedas , and numerous papers on the Vedas and linguistics , many of which were collected in the Oriental and Linguistic Studies series ( 1872\u201374 ) . He wrote several books on language , and grammar textbooks of English , French , German , and Sanskrit .",
      "His Sanskrit Grammar ( 1879 ) is notable in part for the criticism it contains of the Ashtadhyayi , the Sanskrit grammar attributed to Panini . Whitney describes the Ashtadhyayi as containing the facts of the language cast into the highly artful and difficult form of about four thousand algebraic-like rules ( in the statement and arrangement of which brevity alone is had in view at the cost of distinctness and unambiguousness ) .",
      "In his Course in General Linguistics in the chapter on the Immutability and Mutability of the Sign , Ferdinand de Saussure credits Whitney with insisting on the arbitrary nature of linguistic signs .",
      "The linguist Roman Jakobson ( Jakobson 1965 , 23-4 ) remarks that Whitney exerted a deep influence on European linguistic thought by promoting the thesis of language as a social institution . In his fundamental books of the 1860s and 1870s , language was defined as a system of arbitrary and conventional signs . This doctrine was borrowed and expanded by Ferdinand de Saussure , and it entered into the posthumous edition of his Course , adjusted by his disciples C . Bally and Albert Sechehaye ( 1916 ) . The teacher declares : On the essential point it seems to us that the American linguist is right : language is a convention , and the nature of the sign that is agreed upon remains indifferent . Jakobson writes , Arbitrariness is posited as the first of two basic principles for defining the nature of the verbal sign : The bond uniting the signifier with the signified is arbitrary . The commentary points out that no one has controverted this principle but it is often easier to discover a truth than to assign to it the appropriate place .",
      "Although he suffered from a heart ailment in his later years , he was editor-in-chief of the first edition of the respected Century Dictionary , which appeared from 1889 to 1891 .",

      "Tommy Bolin",
      "Thomas Richard Bolin ( August 1 , 1951 \u2013 December 4 , 1976 ) was an American guitarist and songwriter who played with Zephyr ( from 1969 to 1971 ) , The James Gang ( from 1973 to 1974 ) , and Deep Purple ( from 1975 to 1976 ) , in addition to maintaining a notable career as a solo artist and session musician .",
      "Musical career .",
      "Early years .",
      "Tommy Bolin was born in Sioux City , Iowa , United States , and began playing with a band called The Miserlous before he was asked to join another band called Denny and The Triumphs , in 1964 at the young age of thirteen . The band included Dave Stokes on lead vocals , Brad Miller on guitar and vocals , Bolin on lead guitar , Steve Bridenbaugh on organ and vocals and finally Denny Foote on bass & Brad Larvick on drums . They played a blend of rock and roll , R&B and the pop hits of the moment , and when bassist Denny Foote left the band to be replaced by the drummers brother George Larvick Jr , they changed their name and became A Patch of Blue . An album was released in 1969 , Patch of Blue Live ! from two 1967 concerts in Correctionville , Iowa and in Sioux City . In 1969 , the band was inducted in the Iowa Rock & Roll Hall of Fame .",
      "Bolin moved to Boulder , Colorado , in his late teens and then played in a band called American Standard ( with future songwriting collaborator Jeff Cook ) before joining Ethereal Zephyr , a band named after a train that ran between Denver and Chicago . When record companies became interested , the name was shortened to Zephyr . This band included Bolin on lead guitar , David Givens on bass , and Givens wife Candy Givens on vocals . The band had begun to do larger venues , opening for more established acts such as Led Zeppelin . Their second album , entitled Going Back to Colorado , featured a new drummer , Bobby Berge , who would pop up from time to time in musician credits in album liner notes from Bolins later projects .",
      "In 1972 , the 20-year old Bolin formed the fusion jazz-rock-blues band Energy . Unable to secure a record contract , the band never released an album during Bolins lifetime . However , several recordings have been released posthumously . Bolin briefly reunited with David and Candy Givens in a band called the 4-Nikators , after which he took nearly a year off from music . During this time , he wrote close to a hundred songs .",
      "James Gang and Billy Cobham .",
      "Stuck between the musical direction he wanted to pursue and a nearly-empty bank account , 1973 found Bolin replacing Domenic Troiano , who had replaced Joe Walsh , in the James Gang . He recorded two James Gang records : Bang in 1973 and Miami in 1974 . Bolin wrote or co-wrote all but one song on these two albums .",
      "In between the two James Gang albums , Bolin played on Mahavishnu Orchestra member Billy Cobhams solo album Spectrum , which included Bolin on guitar , Cobham on drums , Leland Sklar on bass and Jan Hammer ( also of Mahavishnu Orchestra ) on keyboards and synthesizers .",
      "After the Miami tour , Bolin wanted out of the James Gang . He went on to do session work for numerous rock bands and also with a number of jazz artists including Alphonse Mouzons album Mind Transplant , considered easily one of the best fusion recordings of all time by AllMusic reviewer Robert Taylor . He also toured with Carmine Appice and The Good Rats . At the start of 1975 , Bolin was a guest studio guitarist for Canadian band Moxy during the recording of their debut album , on which Bolin contributed guitar solos for six songs .",
      "First solo album and Deep Purple .",
      "Later in 1975 , Bolin signed with Nemperor records to record a solo album . Bolin was encouraged and coached by The Beach Boys to do his own vocals on this album as well . Session players on this record included David Foster , David Sanborn , Jan Hammer , Stanley Sheldon , Jeff Porcaro , Phil Collins and Glenn Hughes ( uncredited due to contractual reasons ) . During the recording of this album , he was contacted by Deep Purple .",
      "After Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple , the band had a meeting and discussed whether to disband or try to find a replacement , and chose the latter option . David Coverdale had been listening to the Billy Cobham LP Spectrum , on which Bolin was lead guitarist for four songs . He decided he wanted Bolin in Deep Purple , and invited him over for a jam . He jammed with the band for four hours and the job was his . The band then relocated to Munich , Germany , to begin work on Come Taste the Band . Bolin wrote or co-wrote seven of the records nine tracks , including the instrumental Owed to G , which was a tribute to George Gershwin . Come Taste the Band was released in October 1975 , and Australian , Japanese and US tours ensued . Bolins solo album Teaser was released in November , but his obligations to Deep Purple meant he could not support his own album with a tour .",
      "While the Come Taste the Band album sold moderately well and revitalized Deep Purple for a time , the concert tours had many low points . Audiences expected Bolin to play solos that sounded like Blackmores , but the guitarists styles were very different . Bolins issues with hard drugs plus fellow band member Glenn Hughes cocaine addiction , also led to several below-par concert performances . One such concert in Tokyo came after Bolin had passed out and fell asleep on his left arm for eight hours . At showtime , he was only able to play simple chords in a bar fashion , with keyboardist Jon Lord having to play many of the guitar parts on the organ . Unfortunately , this concert was recorded for a live album called Last Concert in Japan . Despite pleas by band members to not release the album , it came out in Japan and found its way into the UK and the US . A better concert recording by this Deep Purple lineup was made in Long Beach , California in early 1976 , and released in 1995 as .",
      "The Tommy Bolin Band and second solo album .",
      "After Deep Purple disbanded in March 1976 , Bolin was free to form the Tommy Bolin Band and he hit the road while making plans for a second solo album . The Tommy Bolin Band had a rotating cast of players which included Narada Michael Walden , Mark Stein , Norma Jean Bell , Reggie McBride , Jimmy Haslip , Max Carl Gronenthal and eventually Bolins younger brother Johnnie Bolin on drums .",
      "By mid-1976 , CBS Records signed Bolin and he began to record Private Eyes , his second and last solo record , in June . The album was released in September , and a supporting tour ensued .",
      "Death .",
      "Bolins tour for Private Eyes would be his final live appearances . He opened for Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck . In his final show , he opened for Beck on December 3 , 1976 in Miami , and encored with a rendition of Post Toastee . He also posed for his last photo , sitting backstage with Jeff Beck after the show , which appeared in Rolling Stone . The article in Rolling Stone stated , Just before Bolins final concert , Jon Marlowe of The Miami News , after an interview with the guitarist , told him , Take care of yourself , to which Tommy replied , Ive been taking care of myself my whole life . Dont worry about me . Im going to be around for a long time . ( Issue No . 230 ; page 14 ) . Hours later , Bolin died from an overdose of heroin and other substances , including alcohol , cocaine and barbiturates . He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Sioux City , Iowa .",
      "Personal life .",
      "He was the first child in the family of Richard Bolin and Barbara Joseph . Bolins father Richard was of Swedish descent and his mother Barbara was the daughter of Lebanese immigrants from Ferzol , Lebanon . His maternal grandfather Abraham Abe Joseph was a recording musician in Lebanon before immigrating to the USA . The Bolin estate has about 15 records of his grandfather in the safe vault . He had two younger brothers named Johnnie ( drummer with Black Oak Arkansas ) and Rick ( a singer ) .",
      "In a 1975 article , Bolin called himself an entirely self-taught guitarist who plays by ear , stating , I only ever had four lessons . I don\u2019t know any scales at all . I know what to play , but don\u2019t know any scales because I never bothered to learn any .",
      "Tributes .",
      "In 2008 , a book titled Touched By Magic : The Tommy Bolin Story by author Greg Prato was released , which featured all-new interviews with former bandmates , family members , and friends of Bolin , which recounted his entire life story . The same year , a photo of Bolin was used for the front cover for the book Gettin Tighter : Deep Purple 68\u201376 , by author Martin Popoff .",
      "In 2010 , several well-known artists gathered to create a tribute album titled Mister Bolins Late Night Revival , a compilation of 17 previously unreleased tracks written by the guitar legend . The CD includes works by HiFi Superstar , Doogie White , Eric Martin , Troy Luccketta , Jeff Pilson , Randy Jackson , Rex Carroll , Rachel Barton , Derek St . Holmes , Kimberley Dahme , and The 77s . A percentage of the proceeds from this project will benefit the Jackson Recovery Centers .",
      "Producer Greg Hampton ( who has previously worked on such archival Bolin releases as Whips and Roses ) co-produced ( with Govt Mule leader Warren Haynes ) a tribute to Bolin , , which was released in 2012 , and featured contributions from Brad Whitford , Nels Cline , John Scofield , Myles Kennedy , Derek Trucks , Steve Morse , and Peter Frampton , among many others .",

      "Rainier Brewing Company",
      "Rainier Brewing Company ( 1878\u20131999 ) was a Seattle , Washington , company that brewed Rainier Beer , a popular brand in the Pacific Northwest of the United States . Although Rainier was founded in 1884 , the Seattle site had been brewing beer since 1878 . The beer is no longer brewed in Seattle , nor is the company owned locally . In the late 1990s , the company was sold to Strohs , then to Pabst Brewing Company , though Miller contract brews most of Pabsts beers . The brewery was closed by Pabst in 1999 and sold .",
      "The brewery itself is a well-known fixture in the south end of town , adjacent to I-5 just north of the Spokane Street Viaduct . The plant is also home to the Tullys Coffee headquarters , Bartholomew Winery , Red Soul Motorcycle Fabrications , as well as artist lofts , band practice spaces , and a recording studio . The trademark red neon R that sat atop the building was replaced with a green T built by Western Neon , when Tullys was using the plant to roast coffee . The neon R is now on display at Seattles Museum of History and Industry which was refurbished by local Seattle sign company Western Neon . The green T was removed on September 30 , 2013 by Tullys , and a red neon replica R , built by Western Neon , returned to the top of the brewery on October 24 , 2013 . The brand is currently owned and operated by Pabst Brewing Company . In Canada , it is brewed and distributed by Sleeman Breweries as Rainier Lager .",
      "History .",
      "Origins .",
      "The original brewery dates all the way back to 1854 when A.B . Rabbeson opened Washington Brewery , which was Seattle\u2019s first commercial brewing company . In 1872 , Rabbeson renamed his brewery Seattle Brewery . They launched Rainier beer in 1878 and would produce and distribute Rainier for the next decade . Concurrently , John Kopp and Andrew Hemrich founded Seattle Brewing and Malting in 1883 . In 1888 , Rabbeson sold his brewery , along with the Rainier brand , to Kopp and Hemrich .",
      "The Prohibition era .",
      "Kopp and Hemrich produced Rainier beer in Washington until 1916 , when the state of Washington enacted its own prohibition , 4 years before the 18th amendment enacted the nationwide prohibition . During this time they opened a brewery in San Francisco where they brewed Rainier beer until 1920 when the 18th amendment was ratified . The company survived prohibition by producing a variety of different nonalcoholic products .",
      "Post-Prohibition relaunch .",
      "Following the repeal of the Prohibition , the brewery was purchased by Lethbridge , Alberta brewers Fritz and Emil Sick , who then repurchased the Rainier brand and began brewing Rainier in 1935 . The brewery went through several names , such as Sicks Seattle Brewing and Malting and Sicks Rainier Brewing Company , during the 1935\u20131977 period .",
      "After Rainier Brewing Company resumed producing Rainier Beer after the end of Prohibition and its advertisements became ubiquitous in the Seattle-Tacoma area , a rumor began circulating that the brewerys owner , Emil Sick , had bribed a Washington state committee with free beer to name the local mountain Rainier . This , however , is an urban legend and can still be heard today among Tacoma residents who preferred the alternate name of Mount Tacoma . Sick did , however , purchase the local baseball team and named them the Seattle Rainiers for this purpose .",
      "Sicks also brewed Rainier at a branch brewery in Spokane , which closed in 1962 .",
      "Creative packaging .",
      "From 1952 to 1964 , Rainier came packaged in a series of decorative beer cans known as the Rainier Jubilee Series . First in the series were a set of Christmas cans marketed in late 1952 and again in late 1953 ; these cans are rare and highly collectible today . The Christmas cans proved such a success that Rainiers use of decorative Jubilee Series cans continued for over a decade , with thousands of different designs . Most of these are not as rare and collectible as the Christmas cans , but the reindeer cans ( which were sold only in Alaska ) , and the first pull tab Jubilee cans ( made only in the last couple of years of the Jubilee Series ) are also considered rare .",
      "Other brands of beer brewed by Sicks Rainier Brewing during this time included Rheinlander and Sicks Select . Later , the Rainier brewery would also take over brewing Heidelberg beer after its brewery in Tacoma , Washington , closed . Each of these brands ( as well as rival Northwest brands Lucky Lager , Olympia , and Blitz-Weinhard ) were once staples in the Pacific Northwest beer market , but starting in the 1960s and 1970s began losing market share to the major national brands .",
      "1970s and 1980s advertising campaigns .",
      "During the 1970s , Rainier ran a number of memorable television ads in the Pacific Northwest , largely conceived by Seattle designer Terry Heckler , assisted by several of his staff , especially Ed Leimbacher , writer/producer for Rainier print , radio and TV for a dozen years . Sound man Joe Hadlock of Bear Creek Studio joined the colleagues of Heckler Bowker for 14 years of creating noise and music for these advertisements .",
      "Some of these surrealist advertisements noted by Seattle Magazine included the Running of the MFRs ( Mountain Fresh Rainiers ) ( a parody of Running of the Bulls featuring bottles with legs ) , and frogs that croaked Rainier Beer ( a motif appropriated many years later by Budweiser ) . Mickey Rooney appeared in several TV ads , most notably a parody of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonalds Indian Love Call from the 1936 MGM film Rose Marie . Mickey was dressed in a Mountie costume alongside his wife Jan as they sang . ( Most airings of this commercial ended with Rooney pouring a bottle of Rainier into her proffered glass , but occasionally a version was aired in which he poured the beer into her cleavage. ) A commercial ad featured a motorcycle that revved Raiiiiiiiii-nieeeeeeeer-Beeeeeeeer while zooming by along a mountain road was notable in the late 1970s and early 1980s . A version of this commercial that played on radio featured the sounds of different brands of motorcycles making the Rainier Beer revving sound. )",
      "Other ads featured a Lawrence Welk double ( played by actor Pat Harrington , Jr. ) leading his band in The Wunnerful Rainier Waltz , complete with bubble machine and soloists blowing on beer bottles ; and a performance of a parody of the song Youre the Tops while thousands of Rainier bottle caps fell like dominoes in a giant R frame . ( The whole commercial was reportedly shot on the first take , a great relief since it took all day to set up. ) Rainier also produced humorous posters such as a National Beergraphic parody of a National Geographic Magazine cover depicting tourists encountering an MFR in the forest , and a Flash Gordon/Star Wars poster , Fresh Wars , that recalled the bar scene in [ [ Star Wars ( film ) |Star Wars : Episode 4 ] ] . There were even costumed MFRs that made promotional appearances at supermarkets during this period .",
      "Several commercials were parodies of movies , TV shows and famous spokespeople of the time . For example , a couple made references to popular [ [ Saturday Night Live ] ] skits : one with a [ [ Gilda Radner ] ] lookalike in her role as Roseanne Roseanneadanna in a",
      "[ [ Weekend Update ] ] skit for Rainier Lite commercial ; another had characters called the R-Heads , which was a reference to the [ [ Coneheads ] ] , with Rainier R logos on the top of their heads . Two commercials featured a Tarzan character where his yell is Raaaiiinn-iiieeer! . A commercial featured a silhouette of [ [ Alfred Hitchcock ] ] who would morph into a beer bottle . Another commercial featured a [ [ John Houseman ] ] imitator when Houseman at the time was a spokesperson for [ [ Morgan Stanley Wealth Management|Smith Barney ] ] . Another series of commercials featured a [ [ Lee Iacocca ] ] impersonator walking through stacks of beer cans . One final series of commercials was the [ [ John Rambo|Rambo ] ] like character called R-bo , played by [ [ Dan Roland ] ] . The R-bo commercials were filmed in three parts ; only two of those commercials aired , however . The third commercial was never seen , because Rainier Brewery was bought out by another brewing company which did not choose to continue the campaign .",
      "Demise .",
      "In 1977 the brewery was sold to [ [ G . Heileman Brewing Company ] ] , and passed through several more hands before finally winding up owned by [ [ Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst ] ] , which closed it in 1999 . The Rainier brand was sold to General Brewing Company , which moved production to the Olympia brewery in nearby [ [ Tumwater , Washington ] ] . The [ [ Olympia Brewing Company ] ] closed in 2003 . Rainier Beer is now brewed under contract in [ [ Irwindale , California ] ] .",
      "In 1999 , [ [ Sleeman Breweries ] ] of [ [ Guelph , Ontario ] ] , a division of [ [ Sapporo Breweries ] ] , acquired Stroh Canada which owned the Canadian rights to a folio of brands , including Rainier . Sleeman then became the Canadian manufacturer and distributor .",
      "In 1987 , Rainier was awarded a silver medal by the [ [ Great American Beer Festival ] ] in the category of Best American Light Lager . The [ [ GABF ] ] recognized Rainier again in 1990 , 1998 , and 2000 with the gold medal for Best American-Style Lager as well as silver medals in the same category in 2003 and 2005 . Both Rainier Light and Rainier Ice have received medals , in their respective categories , from the GABF .",

      "The red Rainier R logo has become an icon of the Rainier Brewing Company , dating back to the 1900s . The logo has gone through a few redesigns , having adopted the current R logo since the 1950s . Before that , the logo contained baseball style word mark with the R logo , shown in early 1900s advertisements up until the 1950s . After that , the word mark changed to go with the revised R logo , and it is still being used today . In 1953 , a large red neon R logo sign was created and placed atop the brewery . After Tullys leased the brewery in 2000 , they replaced the iconic R with a green neon Tullys T sign . The original red R sign was sold to the [ [ Museum of History & Industry ( MOHAI ) ] ] , in which it is now on display at its new location at [ [ South Lake Union , Seattle ] ] . On September 18 , 2013 , Tullys ( under new owners ) decided to replace the green T with a replica of the red R sign . The green T sign was removed on September 30 , 2013 , and the new red R sign was installed on October 24 , 2013 . The replica R sign is different from the original R sign ; along with the new R having lights on both sides , the new sign is made of lighter [ [ aluminium ] ] , and it has [ [ Light-emitting diode|LED ] ] lights , requiring them to only replace the lights every five to seven years .",

      "Samuel Selvon ( 20 May 1923 \u2013 16 April 1994 ) was a Trinidad-born writer , who moved to London , England , in the 1950s . His 1956 novel The Lonely Londoners is groundbreaking in its use of creolised English , or nation language , for narrative as well as dialogue .",
      "Life and work .",
      "Samuel Dickson Selvon was born in San Fernando in the south of Trinidad , the sixth of seven children . His parents were Indian : his father was a first-generation Christian Tamil immigrant from Madras and his mother was a Christian Anglo-Indian . His maternal grandfather was Scottish and his maternal grandmother was Indian . He was educated at Naparima College , San Fernando , before leaving at the age of 15 to work . He was a wireless operator with the local branch of the Royal Naval Reserve from 1940 to 1945 during the Second World War . Thereafter , he moved north to Port of Spain , and from 1945 to 1950 , worked for the Trinidad Guardian as a reporter and for a time on its literary page . In this period , he began writing stories and descriptive pieces , mostly under a variety of pseudonyms , including Michael Wentworth , Esses , Ack-Ack , and Big Buffer . Much of this early writing is to be found in Foreday Morning ( eds Kenneth Ramchand and Susheila Nasta , 1989 ) .",
      "Selvon moved to London , England , in 1950 , where he took menial jobs eventually working as a clerk for the Indian Embassy , while writing in his spare time . His short stories and poetry appeared in various publications , including the London Magazine , New Statesman , and The Nation . In London he also worked with the BBC , producing two television scripts , Anansi the Spiderman , and Home Sweet India .",
      "Selvon was a fellow in creative writing at the University of Dundee from 1975 until 1977 . In the late 1970s Selvon moved to Alberta , Canada , and found a job teaching creative writing as a visiting professor at the University of Victoria . When that job ended , he took a job as a janitor at the University of Calgary in Alberta for a few months before becoming writer-in-residence there . He was largely ignored by the Canadian literary establishment , with his works receiving no reviews during his residency .",
      "On a return trip to Trinidad Selvon died of respiratory failure due to extensive bronchopneumonia and chronic lung disease on 16 April 1994 at Piarco International Airport ; his ashes were subsequently interred at the University of the West Indies cemetery , St Augustine , Trinidad .",
      "Selvon married twice : in 1947 to Draupadi Persaud , with whom he had one daughter , and in 1963 to Althea Daroux , with whom he had two sons and a daughter .",
      "Writing .",
      "Selvon is best known for his novels The Lonely Londoners ( 1956 ) and Moses Ascending ( 1975 ) . His novel A Brighter Sun ( 1952 ) , detailing the construction of the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway in Trinidad through the eyes of young Indian worker Tiger , was a popular choice on the CXC English Literature syllabus for many years . Other notable works include the collection of stories Ways of Sunlight ( 1957 ) , Turn Again Tiger ( 1958 ) and Those Who Eat the Cascadura ( 1972 ) . During the 1960s and 1970s , Selvon converted several of his novels and stories into radio scripts , broadcast by the BBC , which were collected in Eldorado West One ( Peepal Tree Press , 1988 ) and Highway in the Sun ( Peepal Tree Press , 1991 ) .",
      "The Lonely Londoners , like most of Selvons later work , focuses on the migration of West Indians to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s , and tells , mostly in anecdotal form , the daily experience of settlers from Africa and the Caribbean . Selvon also illustrates the panoply of different subcultures that exist within London , as with any major city , due to class and racial boundaries . In many ways , his books are the precursors to works such as White Teeth ( 2000 ) by Zadie Smith and The Buddha of Suburbia ( 1990 ) by Hanif Kureishi . Selvon explained :",
      "When I wrote the novel that became The Lonely Londoners , I tried to recapture a certain quality in West Indian everyday life . I had in store a number of wonderful anecdotes and could put them into focus , but I had difficulty starting the novel in straight English . The people I wanted to describe were entertaining people indeed , but I could not really move . At that stage , I had written the narrative in English and most of the dialogues in dialect . Then I started both narrative and dialogue in dialect and the novel just shot along .",
      "Selvons papers are now at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas , Austin , USA . These consist of holograph manuscripts , typescripts , book proofs , manuscript notebooks , and correspondence . Drafts for six of his 11 novels are present , along with supporting correspondence and items relating to his career .",
      "Awards and legacy .",
      "Selvon was awarded two Guggenheim Fellowships ( in 1955 and 1968 ) , an honorary doctorate from Warwick University in 1989 , and in 1985 the honorary degree of DLitt by the University of the West Indies . In 1969 he was awarded the Trinidad & Tobago Hummingbird Medal Gold for Literature , and in 1994 he was ( posthumously ) given another national award , the Chaconia Medal Gold for Literature . In 2012 he was honoured with a NALIS Lifetime Achievement Literary Award for his contributions to Trinidad and Tobagos literature .",
      "On what would have been his 95th birthday , 20 May 2018 , Selvon was honoured with a Google Doodle .",

      "Young Girl with a Flower Basket",
      "Young Girl with a Flower Basket ( French : Fillette \u00e0 la corbeille fleurie or Jeune fille nue avec panier de fleurs or Fillette nue au panier de fleurs or Le panier fleuri ) is a 1905 oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso from his Rose Period . The painting depicts a Parisian street girl , named Linda , whose fate is unknown . It was painted at a key phase in Picassos life , as he made the transition from an impoverished bohemian at the start of 1905 to a successful artist by the end of 1906 . The painting is listed as one of the most expensive paintings , after achieving a price of $115 million when it was sold at Christies on 8 May 2018 . It is currently the third highest selling painting by Picasso .",
      "Background .",
      "After achieving some early success in 1901 , Picasso was still a struggling artist by 1905 , living in penury in Montmartre . The work was painted at the new studio that he took on the top floor of the dilapidated building at 13 rue Ravignan , which the poet Max Jacob termed Le Bateau-Lavoir . The Cirque M\u00e9drano was situated nearby at the foot of Montmartre , and Picasso was inspired by the harlequins and saltimbanques , clowns , jugglers and other acts , making the transition from his bleak Blue Period to his more optimistic Rose Period .",
      "Young Girl with a Flower Basket was created in the autumn of 1905 , after Picasso returned to Paris from spending six weeks painting in the countryside in Holland . The experience of his Dutch trip was also coupled with a renewed Parisian interest in classical art , which had great influence on Picassos work during that year . The art historian Alfred H . Barr , Jr . remarked on the influence of classicism on Picasso during this period.During the second half of the year [ Picasso\u2019s ] work began to assume a classic breadth and repose . Such paintings\u2026reveal the new style , more objective in feeling , more studied in pose , broadly and more solidly modeled , simpler in color . Picasso\u2019s youthful classicism is informal , fresh , unacademic.. . During this brief moment in his youth he was able to hold in delicate , intuitive balance the human and the ideal , the personal and the traditional.Later in 1905 , Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9 introduced Picasso to the collectors Gertrude Stein and Leo Stein and they became friends , buying Femme au bras lev\u00e9 ( 1905 ) direct from the artist . Picasso completed Portrait of Gertrude Stein in 1906 . The acquisitions by the Steins were to mark the beginnings of Picassos commercial success , and by the end of 1906 his works were being bought by the influential art dealer Ambroise Vollard .",
      "Description .",
      "The subject of the painting is a young girl who was working as a flower seller , but also probably as a teenage child prostitute . She is depicted naked , save for pink ribbons in her dark hair and a necklace , and she is holding a basket of red flowers , all painted with simplified lines and flattened blocks of colour . Her silhouette against the blue background appears awkward and her expression is troubled . The painting is signed Picasso on the upper right corner , and again signed , dated and inscribed Picasso 1905 13 Rue Ravignan on the reverse . It measures .",
      "According to Christie\u2019s , Picasso referred to the girl as Linda , which translates as pretty , which could have been a nickname . Her identity and life story remain a mystery . It was reported by John Richardson in his exhibition catalogue for the Late Picasso exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London in 1988 ( p . 340 ) , based on the writings of Jean-Paul Crespelle , that the subject was called Linda la Bouqueti\u00e8re , from the Place du Tertre , and she worked outside the Moulin Rouge . She also worked as an artists model ; in addition to Picasso , she was painted by Kees van Dongen and Amedeo Modigliani .",
      "Picassos painting of Linda displays elements of Egyptian art and classicism . Picasso was greatly inspired by the work of the French Neoclassical painter Ingres . This influence can be seen in the awkward side silhouette of the girl , which is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian art . However , the portrait of the girl is realistic rather than an idealised image of a goddess . Her figure is conveyed using simple curves and minimal detail , yet her face is given a more realistic expression .",
      "Many of Picassos paintings of this period combine conflicting elements of innocence and experience . In Young Girl with a Flower Basket , the stark contrast between the whiteness of the childs skin and the bright red colour of the flowers in her basket has been considered to be a juxtaposition of chastity and sexuality and of innocence and corruption . Picassos classical rendering of Linda was designed to convey an aura of purity that contrasts starkly with the harsh reality of her existence . An earlier pen and ink sketch suggests Picasso originally planned to paint the girl in a white dress , as if attending her first communion , with the red flowers symbolising the blood of the Eucharist . This theme is also exhibited in Gar\u00e7on \u00e0 la pipe , the subject of which was described by Picasso as an evil angel . Like Lindas basket of red flowers , he wears a garland of roses to symbolise the blood of the Eucharist . Both paintings describe the transition from youth to maturity and innocence to experience .",
      "Significance and legacy .",
      "Young Girl with a Flower Basket has been described as a , masterpiece , depicting a statuesque nude with a melancholy expression . The art historian John Richardson described the subject as a sultry looking gamin , while the paintings former owner , Gertrude Stein complained that the girl has feet like a monkey .",
      "Gertrude eventually learned to appreciate the painting , describing it in 1909 as , a solid thing , a charming thing , a lovely thing , a perplexing thing , a disconcerting thing , a simple thing , a clear thing , a complicated thing , an interesting thing , a disturbing thing , a repellent thing , a very pretty thing .",
      "Marc Porter , Chairman of Christie\u2019s America , summarised the paintings significance and legacy.Picasso , the greatest artist of the 20th century , saw our future in 1905 when he painted Fillette \u00e0 la corbeille fleurie . She represents the themes that Picasso would wrestle with for his life \u2014 love , sex , beauty , tenderness , violence \u2014 and all that defines humanity . In this masterpiece , Picasso reveals his singular brilliance in a timeless , mesmerising goddess gazing on the universe .",
      "Provenance .",
      "Picasso sold the painting to the Galerie du Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle run by art dealer near the gallery of Ambroise Vollard . Sagot drove a hard bargain . He originally offered 700 francs for three works - this painting , and two works in gouache made in the Netherlands . Picasso initially refused , but desperate for money he returned to take up Sagots offer a few days later . Sagot cannily cut his offer to 500 francs , which Picasso also refused . Forced by his poverty to return to Sagot again some days later , the work was eventually sold for just 75 francs , and put up for sale in Sagots gallery as La fleur du pav\u00e9 ( The flower of the cobblestones ) .",
      "It became the second of three Rose period paintings acquired by the collectors Gertrude Stein and Leo Stein . The Stein siblings had been living in Paris from 1903 , and began collecting contemporary artworks in 1904 , buying works by C\u00e9zanne , Gauguin and Renoir from Ambroise Vollard . Sagot sold Picassos Famille dacrobates avec singe ( 1905 ) to Leo Stein , and the couple later acquired Fillette \u00e0 la corbeille fleurie . The Steins quarrelled about this second purchase , as Leo wanted it but Gertrude did not ; in the end Gertrude relented and they bought it for 150 francs . In time , Gertrude came to appreciate the painting and later acquired Leos share . In 1938 , Gertude Stein wrote that it was painted at the great moment of the harlequin period , full of grace and delicacy and charm .",
      "After Gertrude Stein died , the painting was retained by her estate , and then sold in 1968 to the Syndicate of the Museum of Modern Art in New York , but quickly resold later that year to David Rockefeller and Peggy Rockefeller . After David Rockefellers death in 2017 , it was sold at Christies on 8 May 2018 with other works from the Rockefeller collection , achieving a sale price of $115 million ."

      "Volvo 9700",
      "The Volvo 9700 is a range of coaches manufactured by Volvo . It was introduced in 2001 as a replacement for the Carrus Star and Vector/Regal models . There are three main models in different heights ; 9700S ( 3.42 m ) , 9700H ( 3.61 m ) and 9700HD ( 3.73 m ) . The 9700S is only available in the Nordic countries . In addition there is the stripped down 9500 and the 9900 with theater seating . The coaches come in a variety of lengths up to 15 metres , depending on models and markets . Volvo 9700 is currently sold in most of Europe and North America ( including Canada , United States and Mexico ) . In 2015 , the Volvo 9800 was launched as a replacement for the Mexican market , followed by the double-decker 9800DD in March 2018 .",
      "First generation ( 2001\u201307 ) .",
      "Carrus had for many years great success in the Nordic countries with the Star model range descending from the Delta Star and also the Vector/Regal model range from Ajokki . After Carrus was acquired by Volvo in 1998 the models also came available in other European countries under a variety of different names like Volvo 7450 and 7550 . In 2001 Volvo gathered all the different models to one name , Volvo 9700 , and on one single platform , the Volvo TX , inheriting most of the visual characteristics from the Star models . Serial production of 9700H and 9700HD started in the summer of 2001 , while 9700S came into production in the autumn . All three heights were built by Carrus Oy Delta in Lieto , while Carrus Oy Ajokki in Tampere only built 9700H and 9700S . In 2003 production also started at Volvo Polska Sp . z o.o . in Wroc\u0142aw , Poland , where only 9700H and 9700HD are built . Ever since the start the plants in Finland have served the Nordic markets , while the Wroc\u0142aw plant has served the rest of Europe , including the UK . As always there has been a few exceptions to this rule for various reasons .",
      "For the Nordic markets they were fitted on both B12B ( rear-engine ) and B12M ( mid-engine ) chassis , with both configurations proving to be nearly equally popular . The B12M being the most popular among old Volvo customers , while the B12B became the choice for new customers . Many customers who earlier had their Carruses built on Scania or Mercedes-Benz chassises chose to become Volvo customers to still be able to get their coach body of choice . In the Wroc\u0142aw plant they were built on B12B only . Even if not being a general offer , a small batch of 9700S were built on B7R chassis in 2004 for a Finnish operator . Also a very small number of the first generation 9700 were built on B9R chassis , but this may have been entirely for testing .",
      "There is also a difference between the Finnish-built and the Polish-built 9700s when it comes to lengths . While they build it to just about any custom length in Finland , those built in Poland are limited to a set of standard lengths ; 12 m , 13 m , 13.8 m and 15 m . From the beginning the Nordic 9700S and 9700H were available as two-axle between 12.0 m and 13.7 m , and as tri-axle up to 15.0 m . However , in 2003 the European Union and European Economic Area limited the maximum length of a two-axle vehicle to 13.5 m , also affecting these models . The 9700HD as a tri-axle came in lengths between 13.0 m and 15.0 m , and as a two-axle they came in lengths around 12 m and a super-short 10.32 m , which was only available on the mid-engine B12M chassis .",
      "In 2004 the model received a minor facelift . That year the Finnish plants were renamed ; the Tampere plant became Volvo Bus Finland Oy Tampere Factory and the Lieto plant became Volvo Bus Finland Oy Turku Factory . Turku being the nearest city to Lieto .",
      "- Non-Volvo chassis , Star 503/603",
      "In 2001 and 2002 , the body model was also available on other chassises as the Carrus Star 503 ( 9700H ) and Star 603 ( 9700HD ) in Finland , Sweden and Norway . A handful of Star 503 were built on Scania K114EB/K124EB and Scania K114IB/K124IB chassis . In Norway they were all sold as Scania Classic . Two Star 503 were built on Mercedes-Benz OC500RF for Norwegian operator TIRB . Only two Star 603 are known to have been built on Scania chassis . A K124EB 6x2 to Norway in summer of 2001 and a K124EB 4x2 to Finland in early 2002 .",
      "Second generation , NG ( 2006\u201313 ) .",
      "The Volvo 9700 NG , also known as 9700 New/Next Generation was revealed in the autumn of 2006 . All new styling , but still the same main shape from the previous 9700 and the decades-old Carrus Star . In 2007 , the 9700 NG was awarded the title Coach of the Year 2008 by European bus journalists . On 1 October 2008 , Volvo closed their operations in Finland . The Tampere plant closed and the Lieto plant was sold back to Finnish investors , mostly related to Carrus , so in a way it was sold back . The new name became Carrus Delta Oy . All 9700s for the Nordic markets are still licence-built at the Lieto plant .",
      "The B12B was still the chassis of choice from the Wroc\u0142aw plant , until late 2009 when Euro V emission requirements were enforced , and all but the 340 hp engines were gone . The higher power outputs were replaced with the new B13R chassis . For the Nordic markets things changed a bit more . The B12M , which was quite popular , was no longer available . The B13R became the obvious replacement for the 9700H and 9700HD models , but the tall-standing B13R would not fit in the 9700S model , so until the introduction of the B11R in 2011 , the 9700S could only be delivered with 340 hp ( B12B ) or 380 hp ( B9R ) . Before 2009 420 hp was quite common with both B12B and B12M .",
      "Third generation , UG ( 2012\u201318 ) .",
      "The Volvo 9700 UG , also known as 9700 Upgrade , was first revealed in November 2012 for the Nordic markets , and the production at the plant in Finland was all changed to UG by early 2013 . For the rest of the European markets , the new generation was postponed to the introduction of the Euro VI compliant chassis models in the autumn . The new generation got new styling details both in the front and the rear end , including new shape of the rear window and new side mirror arms . On the inside Volvo have developed all new seats , giving better side support than the previous ones . They are also a lot thinner , saving some space for legroom . While the Nordic markets got these while still on Euro V/EEV level , they got them also on B9R and B13R chassis , the rest of Europe got them only on B8R and B11R , which are the current offerings .",
      "Fourth generation ( 2018\u2013 ) .",
      "The fourth generation 9700 was unveiled in May 2018 . It is similar to the Mexican 9800 , and is built in the same European plants as the sibling , the new 9900 .",
      "A double decker version of the fourth generation 9700 , the 9700DD , was launched in February 2020 and uses Volvo B11RLE chassis , a variant of B11R . It was first launched with the height of 4,25",
      "m ; a lower , 4 m-height version was launched a year later .",
      "Alternative versions .",
      "Volvo 9700 as brucks .",
      "The 9700 is also available as a bruck , with a large integrated cargo compartment at the rear end of the bus , sold only in Norway , Sweden and northern parts of Finland . The cargo compartment usually has a cargo door on the passenger side and a hydraulic cantilever tail lift . The size of the cargo compartment compared to the passenger section may vary by the customers needs , and some are even fitted with a refrigerated section . In the old days this type of bus was offered by many coachbuilders in the Nordic countries , built on front- or mid-engined chassises , but for the last decade or so Volvo has had very little competition , except for a few double-deckers on Scania chassis , bodied by either Helmark Carosseri or Van Hool . However the brucks are not very common anymore , after the mid-engined B12M chassis was taken out of production in 2009 . A rear-engine chassis makes worsened weight distribution and raised floor height at the rear , which results in less cargo capacity . Only a handful have been built on B12B and B11R since then . Also this type of route is not as common as it used to be , as it is considered cheaper to just buy a normal bus or minibus and have a separate cargo route . There are also fewer bus companies into cargo transport than there used to be a few years ago .",
      "Volvo 9500 .",
      "The Wroc\u0142aw-built Volvo 9500 was introduced as a low-price alternative at IAA Hannover in 2010 , and is essentially a stripped down 9700H NG . At launch it was only available in a single 12.3-metre configuration and without the possibility for a wheelchair lift , which meant that it could not be used in route traffic in all of the EU and EEA countries . This was both to keep the price down , and to avoid it competing with the more costly 9700 models , but after a few years Volvo changed their mind and released a version with wheelchair lift too . From the start it was only built on the B9R chassis , which got replaced by the Euro VI compliant B8R chassis in 2013 . To differentiate the 9500 from the other models , it has simpler-looking headlights , much like those on the Indian Volvo 9400 , but in the same colour as the rest of the bus . And while the rest of the European 9700 models have been upgraded to third generation , the 9500 is still built as the second generation .",
      "Volvo 9900 .",
      "While the first generation of Volvo 9900 introduced in 2001 had many similarities to the 9700 , it was technically a separate construction and was built by Dr\u00f6gm\u00f6ller ( Volvo Busse Deutschland GmbH ) in Heilbronn , Germany . When the second generation was introduced in 2007 , it became a full member of the 9700 family and has since then been built in Poland .",
      "Localized adaptions across the world .",
      "Mexico .",
      "Volvo Buses de M\u00e9xico , S.A . in Tultitl\u00e1n offered a range of 9700 models . Earlier they offered Volvo 9300 ( B9R ) and 9700 ( B12B ) , resembling the 1st . generation European 9700S and 9700HD . They have also offered second generation 9700s . Currently they offer the American version known as 9700 US/CAN and the new model 9800 built on B13R chassis .",
      "Volvos 1st Generation was known as 9700 TX , thanks to the B12B chassis ( known as TX )",
      "Although second generation was built in two platforms ( B12B ( TX ) and B13R ( PX ) ) , two variations came : Luxury and Select . Third generation was presented in 2013 , known as 9700 Grand . This was specially designed for Mexico , and was sold in B13R chassis . Luxury and Select versions were still available , but now known as Grand S for Select , and Grand L for Luxury . In Mexico , 9700s replacement is the new Volvo 9800 .",
      "USA & Canada .",
      "Through Volvos Prevost network , the Volvo 9700 has been available as a 45 ( 13.7 m ) tri-axle coach in North America since 2009 . The North American 9700 differs from all other 9700 models with its split windscreen . The model is also available in Mexico , where it is manufactured . Another difference is the removed door that separated the passenger cabin from the drivers area . Most Volvo coaches in Mexico add a door in the bus to keep the passengers within the designated area .",
      "China .",
      "Volvos Chinese subsidiary Xian Silver Bus Corporation ( jointly owned with Xian Aircraft Industrial Corporation ) offer a range of 9700-derived coaches ; Volvo 9300 ( B7R ) , Volvo 9600 ( B9R ) and Volvo 9800 ( B12M ) .",
      "India .",
      "Volvo Buses India Pvt Ltd in Hosakote , near the city of Bengaluru , started production of the Volvo B7R bi-axle coaches since 2000 . At present , they offer the Volvo 9400 range . In addition to the standard 12 m 9400 ( B7R or B9R chassis ) , they offer since 2012 also the 13.7 m tri-axle 9400XL ( B9R 6x2 chassis ) and the luxurious 14,5 m tri-axle 9400PX ( B11R 6x2 chassis ) .The 9400PX is provided with a steerable tag axle to help it handle tight corners.The latter being the first on the new light-weight Volvo PX platform .",
      "There is also a Volvo 9100 ( built on the Volvo B7R chassis ) , dubbed Asia Bus , which appears to be the low-price alternative in the Indian luxury coach markets . Being the low cost alternative , the bus lacks certain features possessed by the top notch 9400 family . But still manages to provide the same quality and comfort one gets in the 9400s .",

      "Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Holt mich hier raus! , also known colloquially as the Dschungelcamp ( Jungle Camp ) , is a German reality television show , based on the British reality television show Im a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! . The show is produced by ITV Studios Germany and began airing on 9 January 2004 on RTL , and until now have been broadcast 14 seasons . The format sees a group of ten to twelve celebrities , who have usually already appeared on television , live for up to two weeks in a so-called jungle camp in Australia under constant surveillance by television cameras . The aim of the participants is to win the favor of the audience and to stay in the camp for as long as possible in order to be crowned as King or Queen . Since season 13 ( 2019 ) , the winner has also received a prize of \u20ac100,000 .",
      "The show is hosted since the first season by Sonja Zietlow and since season 7 together with Daniel Hartwich , replacing the deceased Dirk Bach . The health and wellbeing of the celebrities and crew is looked after by Medic Bob McCarron and his team from EMS .",
      "In summer of 2015 , a spin-off show with the title Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Lasst mich wieder rein ! ( Im a Star - Let me in again! ) was aired . Brigitte Nielsen won the show and qualified for the following season of the original show .",
      "On 2021 , due the COVID-19 pandemic a new season wasnt aired , but on 15 January 2021 will begin airing a spin-off show with the name Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Die gro\u00dfe Dschungelshow ( Im a Star - The Great Jungle Show ) . In 15 live episodes , the first Campmate for the 2022 anniversary season , is to be found among new prominent applicants . Production takes place in the Nobeo studios in H\u00fcrth-Efferen .",
      "Since 2018 , the events of the show have been discussed in the spin-off show Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Die Stunde danach ( Im a Star - The Hour After ) , moderated by Angela Finger-Erben .",
      "Production .",
      "The German version of the show ran at irregular intervals from 2004 and has been broadcast annually from mid-January since 2011 . Sonja Zietlow and Dirk Bach moderated until the sixth season . After Bachs death , Daniel Hartwich became the second presenter from the seventh season . The moderation texts are written by Micky Beisenherz and Zietlows husband Jens Oliver Haas . In the German and English versions of the show , the paramedic Bob McCarron alias Dr . Bob is responsible for the medical care of the participants , he and his three assistants are in charge . Life in the camp is continuously filmed by cameras . Remarkable scenes are shown every evening in a television broadcast , mostly accompanied by humorous remarks by the moderator duo , who ironically comment on the level of awareness of the contestants .",
      "From the second to the fourth season , RTL broadcast a four-hour special program on Saturdays and Sundays in the afternoons with lots of background information , summaries of the day and films that were not shown in the main show . The name of the show was Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Holt mich hier raus ! \u2013 Spezial , which was moderated by Markus Lanz ( second season ) , Leonard Diepenbrock ( third season ) and Daniel Hartwich ( fourth season ) . In each of the first three seasons , one week after the final broadcast , Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Holt mich hier raus ! \u2013 Das gro\u00dfe Wiedersehen ( The Big Reunion ) broadcast , with all participants as guests and Frauke Ludowigas as moderator . Since the fourth season there has been a reunion of all contestants in the tree house one day after the finale . Here Sonja Zietlow and Dirk Bach and then Daniel Hartwich took over the moderation .",
      "Filming location .",
      "Like in the British and the 2003 American versions , also the german version is produced in Springbrook National Park , near Murwillumbah , New South Wales , Australia . The leaseholder of the area is the British production company Independent Television , formerly Granada Television , which extensively redesigned and built on the previously open area and equipped it with camera and sound technology . During the filming in particular , the area is shielded by military uniformed guards .",
      "The two spin-off shows Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Lasst mich wieder rein ! and Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Die gro\u00dfe Dschungelshow were not filmed in Australia , but were filmed in the Nobeo studios in H\u00fcrth-Efferen .",
      "Format .",
      "Dschungelpr\u00fcfungen .",
      "Dschungelpr\u00fcfungen ( Bushtucker trials ) are used in the show to allow the contestants to gain food and treats for camp . One contestant , sometimes two or rarely more than one contestant , has to pass a trial every day . These trials usually consist of overcoming scary or repulsive situations , for example by having to prepare smaller animals or parts of animals ( e.g . testicles ) , or eat them dead or alive . In addition , in most exams , contestants are awarded e.g . Maggots , beetles and spiders showered or otherwise confronted with them . Since 2020 , RTL and the production company announced that eating trials will no longer contain live bugs . Other trials are dexterity exercises that must be carried out safely at great heights , above or below water . The contestant must collect red or yellow stars during the trial . For each star collected , there is a food ration for the camp residents . The number of stars that can be earned usually corresponds to the current number of camp residents . Every task can be canceled with the exclamation Ich bin ein Star \u2013 Holt mich hier raus! , whereby the contestant loses the stars earned . According to the broadcaster , the basic supply is only guaranteed by 70 grams of rice and beans per person and day . In the first half of the relay , the examinee will be contacted by phone or SMS elected by the spectators , in the second half and partly on the first day the participants determine it themselves through a secret vote . On the last day , all 3 finalists have to compete in a jungle test , where they can earn 5 stars for the last dinner . The first three stars stand for one dish of the course for which the candidate is competing ( starters , main dishes or desserts ) , the fourth for their own drink , and the fifth for a personal goodie ( for example an additional drink ) .",
      "In seasons 10 and 11 , the contestants temporarily competed in two teams ; only the winning team received the food rations they won . In season 12 there were exams for the first time in which the contestant or contestants could only earn all or no star .",
      "Schatzsuche .",
      "On some days a treasure chest is hidden in the forest that the contestants have to recover . The contestants usually go on a treasure hunt in pairs , solve a task and bring the treasure chest to the camp . There the chest is opened , in which there is usually a quiz question with two possible answers . If the contestants answer the task correctly , there is a prize such as candy , beer or spices ; if they answer incorrectly , there is a useless consolation prize , for example a CD . Less often there is a win immediately after solving the task , for example with the task Die dunkle H\u00f6hle ( The dark cave ) .

      "Ludwig Mond",
      "Ludwig Mond ( 7 March 1839 \u2013 11 December 1909 ) was a German-born chemist and industrialist who took British nationality . He discovered an important , previously unknown , class of compounds called metal carbonyls .",
      "Education and career .",
      "Ludwig Mond was born into a Jewish family in Kassel , Germany . His parents were Meyer B\u00e4r ( Moritz ) Mond and Henrietta Levinsohn . After attending schools in his home town , he studied chemistry at the University of Marburg under Hermann Kolbe and at the University of Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen but he never gained a degree . He then worked in factories in Germany and the Netherlands before coming to England to work at the factory of John Hutchinson & Co in Widnes in 1862 . He worked in Utrecht for the firm of P . Smits & de Wolf from 1864 to 1867 and then returned to Widnes . Here he formed a partnership with John Hutchinson and developed a method to recover sulphur from the by-products of the Leblanc process , which was used to manufacture soda ash .",
      "In 1872 Mond got in touch with the Belgian industrialist Ernest Solvay who was developing a better process to manufacture soda ash , the ammonia-soda or Solvay process . The following year he went into partnership with the industrialist John Brunner to work on bringing the process to commercial viability . They established the business of Brunner Mond & Company , building a factory at Winnington , Northwich . Mond solved some of the problems in the process that had made mass production difficult , and by 1880 he had turned it into a commercially sound process . Within 20 years the business had become the largest producer of soda ash in the world .",
      "Mond continued to research new chemical processes . He discovered nickel carbonyl , a previously unknown compound and the first-discovered in the class of metal carbonyls , which could be easily decomposed to produce pure nickel from its ores through the Mond process . He founded the Mond Nickel Company to exploit this . Ores from nickel mines in Canada were given preliminary enrichment there and then shipped to Monds works at Clydach , near Swansea , Wales for final purification .",
      "Honours and benefactions .",
      "Mond supported scientific societies and , with Henry Roscoe , helped to expand the small Lancashire Chemical Society into the nationwide Society of Chemical Industry of which he was elected president in 1888 . He was elected to the Royal Society in 1891 . Abroad , he was elected to membership of the German Chemical Society , the Societ\u00e0 Reale of Naples , and the . He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Padua , Heidelberg , Manchester and Oxford and was awarded the grand cordon of the Order of the Crown of Italy .",
      "He was a benefactor to a number of scientific organisations including the Royal Society , the Italian Accademia dei Lincei and the Royal Institution of Great Britain . In his will he left bequests to the town of Kassel and to a number of Jewish charities . In his later years he had built up a collection of old master paintings and he left the greater proportion of these to the National Gallery , London . His wife left a large collection of materials relating to German literature to Kings College , London .",
      "The Royal Society of Chemistry awards the Ludwig Mond Award in his honour . A statue of him , designed by \u00c9douard Lant\u00e9ri ( 1912 ) , stands in front of the former Brunner Mond offices in Winnington , flanked by a statue of Brunner .",
      "Family and personal .",
      "In October 1866 Mond married his cousin Frida L\u00f6wenthal ( 1847\u20131923 ) in her native town of Cologne . They soon moved to England and had two sons , Robert and Alfred . In 1880 he took British nationality . While he was establishing his business the family lived at Winnington and in 1884 they moved to London . From the early 1890s on , he spent most of his winters in Rome at his home there . This home , the Palazzo Zuccari , was first leased and then ( 1904 ) bought in the name of his wifes friend Henriette Hertz , who developed it into a study centre for the history of art now called Bibliotheca Hertziana . He died in his London home , The Poplars , Avenue Road , near Regents Park . Although he had never practised any religion he was buried with Jewish rites at St Pancras cemetery where his sons erected a mausoleum . His estate was valued at \u00a31 million ."

      "Lana Turner",
      "Lana Turner ( ; born Julia Jean Turner ; February 8 , 1921June 29 , 1995 ) was an American actress . Over the course of her nearly 50-year career , she achieved fame as both a pin-up model and a film actress , as well as for her highly publicized personal life . In the mid-1940s , she was one of the highest-paid actresses in the United States , and one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayers ( MGM ) biggest stars , with her films earning the studio more than $50 million during her 18-year contract with them . Turner is frequently cited as a popular culture icon of Hollywood glamour and a screen legend of classical Hollywood cinema .",
      "Born to working-class parents in northern Idaho , Turner spent her childhood there before her family relocated to San Francisco . In 1936 , when Turner was 15 , she was discovered while purchasing a soda at the Top Hat Malt Shop in Hollywood . At the age of 16 , she was signed to a personal contract by Warner Bros . director Mervyn LeRoy , who took her with him when he transferred to MGM in 1938 . She soon attracted attention by playing the role of a murder victim in her film debut , LeRoys They Wont Forget ( 1937 ) , and she later moved into supporting roles , often appearing as an ing\u00e9nue .",
      "During the early 1940s , Turner established herself as a leading lady and one of MGMs top stars , appearing in such films as the film noir Johnny Eager ( 1941 ) ; the musical Ziegfeld Girl ( 1941 ) ; the horror film Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde ( 1941 ) ; and the romantic war drama Somewhere Ill Find You ( 1942 ) , one of several films in which she starred opposite Clark Gable . Turners reputation as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her critically acclaimed performance in the noir The Postman Always Rings Twice ( 1946 ) , a role which established her as a serious dramatic actress . Her popularity continued through the 1950s in dramas such as The Bad and the Beautiful ( 1952 ) and Peyton Place ( 1957 ) , the latter for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress .",
      "Intense media scrutiny surrounded the actress in 1958 when her teenage daughter Cheryl Crane stabbed Turners lover Johnny Stompanato to death in their home during a domestic struggle . Her next film , Imitation of Life ( 1959 ) , proved to be one of the greatest commercial successes of her career , and her starring role in Madame X ( 1966 ) earned her a David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actress . Turner spent most of the 1970s and early 1980s in semi-retirement , making her final film appearance in 1980 . In 1982 , she accepted a much-publicized and lucrative recurring guest role in the television series Falcon Crest , which afforded the series notably high ratings . In 1992 , Turner was diagnosed with throat cancer and died of the disease three years later at age 74 .",
      "Life and career .",
      "1921\u20131936 : Early life and education .",
      "Lana Turner was born Julia Jean Turner on February 8 , 1921 , at Providence Hospital in Wallace , Idaho , a small mining community in the Idaho Panhandle region . She was the only child of John Virgil Turner , a miner from Montgomery , Alabama of Dutch descent , and Mildred Frances Cowan from Lamar , Arkansas , who had English , Scottish and Irish ancestry . Mildred was four days shy of her own 17th birthday when she gave birth to her only child . Lanas parents had first met while 14-year-old Mildred , the daughter of a mine inspector , was visiting Picher , Oklahoma with her father , who was inspecting local mines there . John was 24 years old at the time , and Mildreds father objected to the courtship . Shortly after , the two eloped and moved west , settling in Idaho .",
      "The family lived in Burke , Idaho at the time of Turners birth , and relocated to nearby Wallace in 1925 , where her father opened a dry cleaning service and worked in the local silver mines . As a child , Turner was known to family and friends as Judy . She expressed interest in performance at a young age , performing short dance routines at her fathers Elks chapter in Wallace . At age three , she performed an impromptu dance routine at a charity fashion show in which her mother was modeling .",
      "The Turner family struggled financially , and relocated to San Francisco when she was six years old , after which her parents separated . On December 14 , 1930 , her father won some money at a traveling craps game , stuffed his winnings in his left sock , and headed for home . He was later found bludgeoned to death on the corner of Minnesota and Mariposa Streets , on the edge of San Franciscos Potrero Hill and the Dogpatch District , with his left shoe and sock missing . His robbery and homicide were never solved , and his death had a profound effect on Turner . I know that my fathers sweetness and gaiety , his warmth and his tragedy , have never been far from me , she later said . That , and a sense of loss and of growing up too fast .",
      "Turner sometimes lived with family friends or acquaintances so that her impoverished mother could save money . They also frequently moved , for a time living in Sacramento and throughout the San Francisco Bay Area . Following her fathers death , Turner lived for a period in Modesto with a family who physically abused her and treated her like a servant . Her mother worked 80 hours per week as a beautician to support herself and her daughter , and Turner recalled sometimes living on crackers and milk for half a week .",
      "While baptized a Protestant at birth , Turner attended Mass with the Hislops , a Catholic family with whom her mother had temporarily boarded her in Stockton , California . She became thrilled by the ritual practices of the church , and when she was seven , her mother allowed her to formally convert to Roman Catholicism . Turner subsequently attended the Convent of the Immaculate Conception in San Francisco , hoping to become a nun . In the mid-1930s , Turners mother developed respiratory problems and was advised by her doctor to move to a drier climate , upon which the two moved to Los Angeles in 1936 .",
      "1937\u20131939 : Discovery and early films .",
      "Turners discovery is considered a show-business legend and part of Hollywood mythology among film and popular cultural historians . One version of the story erroneously has her discovery occurring at Schwabs Pharmacy , which Turner claimed was the result of a reporting error that began circulating in articles published by columnist Sidney Skolsky . By Turners own account , she was a junior at Hollywood High School when she skipped a typing class and bought a Coca-Cola at the Top Hat Malt Shop located on the southeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and McCadden Place . While in the shop , she was spotted by William R . Wilkerson , publisher of The Hollywood Reporter . Wilkerson was attracted by her beauty and physique , and asked her if she was interested in appearing in films , to which she responded : Ill have to ask my mother first . With her mothers permission , Turner was referred by Wilkerson to the actor/comedian/talent agent Zeppo Marx . In December 1936 , Marx introduced Turner to film director Mervyn LeRoy , who signed her to a $50 weekly contract with Warner Bros . on February 22 , 1937 . She soon became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of LeRoy , who suggested that she take the stage name Lana Turner , a name she would come to legally adopt several years later .",
      "Turner made her feature film debut in LeRoys They Wont Forget ( 1937 ) , a crime drama in which she played a teenage murder victim . Though Turner only appeared on screen for a few minutes , Wilkerson wrote in The Hollywood Reporter that her performance was worthy of more than a passing note . The film earned her the nickname of the Sweater Girl for her form-fitting attire , which accentuated her bust . Turner always detested the nickname , and upon seeing a sneak preview of the film , she recalled being profoundly embarrassed and squirming lower and lower into her seat . She stated that she had never seen myself walking before\u2026 [ It was ] the first time [ I was ] conscious of my body . Several years after the films release , Modern Screen journalist Nancy Squire wrote that Turner made a sweater look like something Cleopatra was saving for the next visiting Caesar . Shortly after completing They Wont Forget , she made an appearance in James Whales historical comedy The Great Garrick ( 1937 ) , a biographical film about British actor David Garrick , in which she had a small role portraying an actress posing as a chambermaid .",
      "In late 1937 , LeRoy was hired as an executive at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) , and asked Jack L . Warner to allow Turner to relocate with him to MGM . Warner obliged , as he believed Turner would not amount to anything . Turner left Warner Bros . and signed a contract with MGM for $100 a week . The same year , she was loaned to United Artists for a minor role as a maid in The Adventures of Marco Polo . Her first starring role for MGM was scheduled to be an adaptation of The Sea-Wolf , co-starring Clark Gable , but the project was eventually shelved . Instead , she was assigned opposite teen idol Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland in the Andy Hardy film Love Finds Andy Hardy ( 1938 ) . During the shoot , Turner completed her studies with an educational social worker , allowing her to graduate high school that year . The film was a box-office success , and her appearance in it as a flirtatious high school student convinced studio head Louis B . Mayer that Turner could be the next Jean Harlow , a sex symbol who had died six months before Turners arrival at MGM .",
      "Mayer helped further Turners career by giving her roles in several youth-oriented films in the late 1930s , such as the comedy Rich Man , Poor Girl ( 1938 ) in which she played the sister of a poor woman romanced by a wealthy man , and Dramatic School ( 1938 ) , in which she portrayed Mado , a troubled drama student . In the former , she was billed as the Kissing Bug from the Andy Hardy film . Upon completing Dramatic School , Turner screen-tested for the role of Scarlett OHara in Gone with the Wind ( 1939 ) . She was then cast in a supporting part as a sympathetic bad girl in Calling Dr . Kildare ( 1939 ) , MGMs second entry in the Dr . Kildare series . This was followed by These Glamour Girls ( 1939 ) , a comedy in which she portrayed a taxi dancer invited to attend a dance with a male coed at his elite college . Turners onscreen sex appeal in the film was reflected by a review in the St . Louis Post-Dispatch in which she was characterized as the answer to oomph . In her next film , Dancing Co-Ed ( 1939 ) , Turner was given first billing portraying Patty Marlow , a professional dancer who enters a college as part of a rigged national talent contest . The film was a commercial success , and led to Turner appearing on the cover of Look magazine .",
      "In February 1940 , Turner garnered significant publicity when she eloped to Las Vegas with 28-year-old bandleader Artie Shaw , her co-star in Dancing Co-Ed . Though they had only briefly known each other , Turner recalled being stirred by his eloquence , and after their first date the two spontaneously decided to get married . Their marriage only lasted four months , but was highly publicized , and led MGM executives to grow concerned over Turners impulsive behavior . In the spring of 1940 , after the two had divorced , Turner discovered she was pregnant and had an abortion . In contemporaneous press , it was noted she had been hospitalized for exhaustion . She would later recall that Shaw treated her like an untutored blonde savage , and took no pains to conceal his opinion . In the midst of her marriage to Shaw , she starred in We Who Are Young , a drama in which she played a woman who marries her coworker against their employers policy .",
      "1940\u20131945 : War years and film stardom .",
      "In 1940 , Turner appeared in her first musical film , Two Girls on Broadway , in which she received top billing over established co-stars Joan Blondell and George Murphy . A remake of The Broadway Melody , the film was marketed as featuring Turners hottest , most daring role . The following year , she had a lead role in her second musical , Ziegfeld Girl , opposite James Stewart , Judy Garland and Hedy Lamarr . In the film , she portrayed Sheila Regan , an alcoholic aspiring actress based on Lillian Lorraine . Ziegfeld Girl marked a personal and professional shift for Turner ; she claimed it as the first role that got her interested in acting , and the studio , impressed by her performance , marketed the film as featuring her in the best role of the biggest picture to be released by the industrys biggest company . The films high box-office returns elevated Turners profitability , and MGM gave her a weekly salary raise to $1,500 as well as a personal makeup artist and trailer . After completing the film , Turner and co-star Garland remained lifelong friends , and lived in houses next to one another in the 1950s .",
      "Following the success of Ziegfeld Girl , Turner took a supporting role as an ing\u00e9nue in Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde ( 1941 ) , a Freudian-influenced horror film , opposite Spencer Tracy and Ingrid Bergman . MGM had initially cast Turner in the lead , but Tracy specifically requested Bergman for the part . The studio recast Turner in the smaller role , though she was still given top billing . While the film was financially successful , Time magazine panned it , calling it a pretentious resurrection of Robert Louis Stevensons ghoulish classic .. . As for Lana Turner , fully clad for a change , and the rest of the cast .. . they are as wooden as their roles .",
      "Turner was then cast in the Western Honky Tonk ( 1941 ) , the first of four films in which she would star opposite Clark Gable . The Turner-Gable films successes were often heightened by gossip-column rumors about a relationship between the two . In January 1942 , she began shooting her second picture with Gable , titled Somewhere Ill Find You ; however , the production was halted for several weeks after the death of Gables wife , Carole Lombard , in a plane crash . Meanwhile , the press continued to fuel rumors that Turner and Gable were romantic offscreen , which Turner vehemently denied . I adored Mr . Gable , but we were [ just ] friends , she later recalled . When six oclock came , he went his way and I went mine . Her next project was Johnny Eager ( 1941 ) , a violent mobster film in which she portrayed a socialite . James Agee of Time magazine was critical of co-star Robert Taylors performance and noted : Turner is similarly handicapped : Metro has swathed her best assets in a toga , swears that she shall become an actress , or else . Under these adverse circumstances , stars Taylor and Turner are working under wraps .",
      "At the advent of World War II , Turners increasing prominence in Hollywood led to her becoming a popular pin-up girl , and her image appeared painted on the noses of U.S . fighter planes , bearing the nickname Tempest Turner . In June 1942 , she embarked on a 10-week war-bond tour throughout the western United States with Gable . During the tour , she began promising kisses to the highest war bond buyers ; while selling bonds at the Pioneer Courthouse in Portland , Oregon , she sold a $5,000 bond to a man for two kisses , and another to an elderly man for $50,000 . Arriving to sell bonds in her hometown of Wallace , Idaho , she was greeted with a banner that read Welcome home , Lana , followed by a large celebration during which the mayor declared a holiday in her honor . Upon completing the tour , Turner had sold $5.25 million in war bonds . Throughout the war , Turner continued to make regular appearances at U.S . troop events and area bases , though she confided to friends that she found visiting the hospital wards of injured soldiers emotionally difficult .",
      "In July 1942 , Turner met her second husband , actor-turned-restaurateur Joseph Stephen Steve Crane , at a dinner party in Los Angeles . The two eloped to Las Vegas a week after they began dating . Their marriage was annulled by Turner four months later upon discovering that Cranes previous divorce had not yet been finalized . After discovering she was pregnant in November 1942 , Turner remarried Crane in Tijuana in March 1943 . During her early pregnancy , she filmed the comedy Marriage Is a Private Affair , in which she starred as a carefree woman struggling to balance her new life as a mother . Though she wanted multiple children , Turner had Rh-negative blood , which caused fetal anemia and made it difficult to carry a child to term . Turner was urged by doctors to undergo a therapeutic abortion to avoid potentially life-threatening complications , but she managed to carry the child to term . She gave birth to a daughter , Cheryl , on July 25 , 1943 . Turners blood condition resulted in Cheryl being born with near-fatal erythroblastosis fetalis .",
      "Meanwhile , publicity over Turners remarriage to Crane led MGM to play up her image as a sex symbol in Slightly Dangerous ( 1943 ) , with Robert Young , Walter Brennan and Dame May Whitty , in which she portrayed a woman who moves to New York City and poses as the long-lost daughter of a millionaire . Released in the midst of Turners pregnancy , the film was financially successful but received mixed reviews , with Bosley Crowther of The New York Times writing : No less than four Metro writers must have racked their brains for all of five minutes to think up the rags-to-riches fable .. . Indeed , there is cause for suspicion that they didnt even bother to think . Critic Anita Loos praised Turners performance in the film , writing : Lana Turner typifies modern allure . She is the vamp of today as Theda Bara was of yesterday . However , she doesnt look like a vamp . She is far more deadly because she lets her audience relax .",
      "In August 1944 , Turner divorced Crane , citing his gambling and unemployment as primary reasons . A lifelong Democrat , she spent the remainder of the year campaigning for Franklin D . Roosevelt during the 1944 presidential election . In 1945 , she co-starred with Laraine Day and Susan Peters in Keep Your Powder Dry , a war drama about three disparate women who join the Womens Army Corps . She was then cast as the female lead in Week-End at the Waldorf , a loose remake of Grand Hotel ( 1932 ) in which she portrayed a stenographer ( a role originated by Joan Crawford ) . The film was a box-office hit .",
      "1946\u20131948 : Expansion to dramatic roles .",
      "After the war , Turner was cast in a lead role opposite John Garfield in The Postman Always Rings Twice ( 1946 ) , a film noir based on James M . Cains debut novel of the same name . She portrayed Cora , an ambitious woman married to a stodgy , older owner of a roadside diner , who falls in love with a drifter and their desire to be together motivates them to murder her husband . The classic film noir marked a turning point in Turners career as her first femme fatale role . Reviews of the film , including Turners performance , were glowing , with Bosley Crowther of The New York Times writing it was the role of her career . Life magazine named the film its Movie of the Week in April 1946 , and noted that both Turner and Garfield were aptly cast and take over the screen , [ creating ] more fireworks than the Fourth of July . Turner commented on her decision to take the role :",
      "The Postman Always Rings Twice became a major box office success , which prompted the studio to take more risks on Turner , casting her outside of the glamorous sex-symbol roles for which she had come to be known . In August 1946 , it was announced she would replace Katharine Hepburn in the big-budget historical drama Green Dolphin Street ( 1947 ) , a role for which she darkened her hair and lost 15 pounds . The film was produced by Carey Wilson , who insisted on casting Turner based on her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice . In the film , she portrayed the daughter of a wealthy patriarch who pursues a relationship with a man in love with her sister . Turner later recalled she was surprised about replacing Hepburn , saying : Im about the most un-Hepburnish actress on the lot . But it was just what I wanted to do . It was her first starring role that did not center on her looks . In an interview , Turner said : I even go running around in the jungles of New Zealand in a dress thats filthy and ragged . I dont wear any make-up and my hairs a mess . Nevertheless , she insisted she would not give up her glamorous image . In the midst of filming Green Dolphin Street , Turner began an affair with actor Tyrone Power , whom she considered to be the love of her life . She discovered she was pregnant with Powers child in the fall of 1947 , but chose to have an abortion . During this time , she also had romantic affairs with Frank Sinatra and Howard Hughes , the latter of which lasted for 12 weeks in late 1946 .",
      "Turners next film was the romantic drama Cass Timberlane , in which she played a young woman in love with an older judge , a role for which Jennifer Jones , Vivien Leigh and Virginia Grey had also been considered . As of early 1946 , Turner was set for the role , but schedules with Green Dolphin Street almost prohibited her from taking it , and by late 1946 , she was nearly recast . Production of Cass Timberlane was exhausting for Turner , because it was shot in between retakes of Green Dolphin Street . Cass Timberlane earned Turner favorable reviews , with Variety noting : Turner is the surprise of the picture via her top performance thespically . In a role that allows her the gamut from tomboy to the pangs of childbirth and from being another mans woman to remorseful wife , she seldom fails to acquit herself creditably .",
      "In August 1947 , immediately upon completion of Cass Timberlane , Turner agreed to appear as the female lead in the World War II-set romantic drama Homecoming ( 1948 ) , in which she was again paired with Clark Gable , portraying a female army lieutenant who falls in love with an American surgeon ( Gable ) . She was the studios first choice for the role , but it was reluctant to offer her the part , considering her overbooked schedule . Homecoming was well received by audiences , and Turner and Gable were nicknamed the team that generates steam . By this period , Turner was at the zenith of her film career , and was not only MGMs most popular star , but also one of the ten highest-paid women in the United States , with annual earnings of $226,000 .",
      "1948\u20131952 : Studio rebranding and personal struggles .",
      "In late 1947 , Turner was cast as Lady de Winter in The Three Musketeers , her first Technicolor film . Around this time , she began dating Henry J . Bob Topping Jr. , a millionaire socialite and brother of New York Yankees owner Dan Topping , and a grandson of tin-plate magnate Daniel G . Reid . Topping proposed to her at the 21 Club in New York City by dropping a diamond ring into her martini , and they married shortly after in April 1948 at the Topping family mansion in Greenwich , Connecticut . Turners wedding celebrations interfered with her filming schedule for The Three Musketeers , and she arrived to the set three days late . Studio head Louis B . Mayer threatened to suspend her contract , but Turner managed to leverage her box-office draw with MGM to negotiate an expansion of her role in the film , as well as a salary increase amounting to $5,000 per week . The Three Musketeers went on to become a box-office success , earning $4.5 million , but Turners contract was put on temporary suspension by Mayer after production finished . After the release of The Three Musketeers , Turner discovered she was pregnant ; in early 1949 , she went into premature labor and gave birth to a stillborn baby boy in New York City .",
      "In 1949 , Turner was to star in A Life of Her Own ( 1950 ) , a George Cukor-directed drama about a woman who aspires to be a model in New York City . The project was shelved for several months , and Turner told journalists in December 1949 : Everybody agrees that the script is still a pile of junk . Im anxious to get started . By the time this one comes out , it will be almost three years since I was last on the screen , in The Three Musketeers . I dont think its healthy to stay off the screen that long . Though she was unenthusiastic about the screenplay , Turner agreed to appear in the film after executives promised her suspension would be lifted upon doing so . A Life of Her Own was among the least successful of Cukors films , receiving unfavorable reviews and low box-office sales . On May 24 , 1950 , Turner left her handprints and footprints in cement in front of Graumans Chinese Theatre .",
      "In response to the poor reception for A Life of Her Own , MGM attempted to rebrand Turner by casting her in musicals . The first , Mr . Imperium , released in March 1951 , was a box-office flop , and had Turner starring as an American woman who is wooed by a European prince . The script was stupid , she recalled . I fought against doing the picture , but I lost . It earned her unfavorable reviews , with one critic from the St . Petersburg Times writing : Without Lana Turner , Mr . Imperium .. . would be a better picture .",
      "During this period , Turners personal finances were in disarray , and she was facing bankruptcy . Suffering from chronic depression over her career and financial problems , she attempted suicide in September 1951 by slitting her wrists in a locked bathroom . She was saved by her business manager , Benton Cole , who broke down the bathroom door and called emergency medical services . The following year , she began filming her second musical , The Merry Widow . During the shoot , Turner began an affair with her co-star Fernando Lamas , which ended after Lamas physically assaulted her ; the incident also caused Lamas to lose his MGM contract upon the productions completion . The Merry Widow proved more commercially successful than Turners previous musical , Mr . Imperium , despite receiving unfavorable critical reviews .",
      "Turners next project was opposite Kirk Douglas in Vincente Minnellis The Bad and the Beautiful ( 1952 ) , a drama focusing on the rise and fall of a Hollywood film mogul , in which Turner portrayed an alcoholic movie star . The Bad and the Beautiful was both a critical and commercial success , and earned her favorable reviews . A little over a week before the films release in December 1952 , Turner divorced her third husband , Bob Topping . She later claimed Toppings drinking problem and excessive gambling as her impetus for the divorce . Her next film project was Latin Lovers ( 1953 ) , a romantic musical in which Lamas had originally been cast . He was replaced by Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n .",
      "1953\u20131957 : MGM departure and film resurgence .",
      "In the spring of 1953 , Turner relocated to Europe for 18 months to make two films under a tax credit for American productions shot abroad . The films were Flame and the Flesh , in which she portrayed a manipulative woman who takes advantage of a musician , and Betrayed , an espionage thriller set in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands ; the latter marked Turners fourth and final film appearance opposite Clark Gable . In The New York Times , Bosley Crowther wrote of Betrayed : By the time this picture gets around to figuring out whether the betrayer is Miss Turner or Mr . Mature , it has taken the audience through such a lengthy and tedious amount of detail that it has not only frayed all possible tension but it has aggravated patience as well . Upon returning to the United States in September 1953 , Turner married actor Lex Barker , whom she had been dating since their first meeting at a party held by Marion Davies in the summer of 1952 .",
      "In 1955 , MGMs new studio head Dore Schary had Turner star as a pagan temptress in the Biblical epic The Prodigal ( 1955 ) , her first CinemaScope feature . She was reluctant to appear in the film because of the characters scanty , atrocious costumes and stupid lines , and during the shoot struggled to get along with co-star Edmund Purdom , whom she later described as a young man with a remarkably high opinion of himself . Variety deemed the film a big-scale spectacle ...End result of all this flamboyant polish , however , is only fair entertainment . Turner was next cast in John Farrows The Sea Chase ( 1955 ) , an adventure film starring John Wayne , in which she portrayed a femme fatale spy aboard a ship . The film , released one month after The Prodigal , was a commercial success .",
      "MGM then gave Turner the titular role of Diane de Poitiers in the period drama Diane ( 1956 ) , which had originally been optioned by the studio in the 1930s for Greta Garbo . After completing Diane , Turner was loaned to 20th Century-Fox to headline The Rains of Ranchipur ( 1955 ) , a remake of The Rains Came ( 1939 ) , playing the wife of an aristocrat in the British Raj opposite Richard Burton . The production was rushed to accommodate a Christmas release and was completed in only three months , but it received unfavorable reviews from critics . Meanwhile , Diane was given a test screening in late December 1955 , and was met with poor response from audiences . Though an elaborate marketing campaign was crafted to promote the film , it was a box-office flop , and MGM announced in February 1956 that it was opting not to renew Turners contract . Turner gleefully told a reporter at the time that she was walking around in a daze . Ive been sprung . After 18 years at MGM , Im a free agent ...I used to go on a bended knee to the front office and say , please give me a decent story . Ill work for nothing , just give me a good story . So what happened ? The last time I begged for a good story they gave me The Prodigal . At the time of her contract termination , Turners films had earned the studio more than $50 million .",
      "In 1956 , Turner discovered she was pregnant with Barkers child , but gave birth to a stillborn baby girl seven months into the pregnancy . In July 1957 , she filed for divorce from Barker after her daughter Cheryl alleged that he had regularly molested and raped her over the course of their marriage . According to Cheryl , Turner confronted Barker before forcing him out of their home at gunpoint . Weeks after her divorce , Turner began filming 20th Century-Foxs Peyton Place , in which she had been cast in the lead role of Constance MacKenzie , a New England mother struggling to maintain a relationship with her teenage daughter . The film , directed by Mark Robson , was adapted from Grace Metalious best-selling novel of the same name . Released in December 1957 , Peyton Place was a major blockbuster success , which worked in Turners favor as she had agreed to take a percentage of the films overall earnings instead of a salary . She also received critical acclaim , with Variety noting that Turner looks elegant and registers strongly , and , for the first and only time , she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress . Though grateful for the nomination , Turner would later state that she felt it was not one of my better roles .",
      "1958\u20131959 : Johnny Stompanato homicide scandal .",
      "In January 1958 , Paramount Pictures released The Lady Takes a Flyer , a romantic comedy in which Turner portrayed a female pilot . While shooting the film the previous spring , she had begun receiving phone calls and flowers on the set from mobster Johnny Stompanato , using the name John Steele . Stompanato had close ties to the Los Angeles underworld and gangster Mickey Cohen , which he feared would dissuade her from dating him . He pursued Turner aggressively , sending her various gifts . Turner was thoroughly intrigued and began casually dating him . After a friend informed her of who Stompanato actually was , she confronted him and tried to break off the affair . Stompanato was not easily deterred , and over the course of the following year , they carried on a relationship filled with violent arguments , physical abuse and repeated reconciliations . Turner would also claim that on one occasion he drugged her and took nude photographs of her while unconscious , potentially to use as blackmail .",
      "In September 1957 , Stompanato visited Turner in London , where she was filming Another Time , Another Place , co-starring Sean Connery . Their meeting was initially happy , but they soon began fighting . Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and , during one fight , he violently choked her . To avoid further confrontation , Turner and her makeup artist , Del Armstrong , called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported . Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun , threatening her and Connery . Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanatos hand and twisting his wrist , causing him to run off the set . Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying . The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted him out of the house and to the airport , where he boarded a plane back to the U.S .",
      "On the evening of March 26 , 1958 , Turner attended the Academy Awards to observe her nomination for Peyton Place and present the award for Best Supporting Actor . Stompanato , angered that he did not attend with her , awaited her return home that evening , whereupon he physically assaulted her . Around 8:00 p.m . on Friday , April 4 , Stompanato arrived at Turners rented home at 730 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills . The two began arguing heatedly in the bedroom , during which Stompanato threatened to kill Turner , her daughter Cheryl and her mother . Fearing that her mothers life was in danger , Cheryl - who had been watching television in an adjacent room - grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to Turners defense .",
      "According to testimony provided by Turner , Stompanato died at the scene when Cheryl , who had been listening to the couples fight behind the closed door , stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner attempted to usher him out of the bedroom . Turner testified that she initially believed Cheryl had punched him , but realized Stompanato had been stabbed when he collapsed and she saw blood on his shirt .",
      "Because of Turners fame and the fact that the killing involved her teenage daughter , the case quickly became a media sensation . More than 100 reporters and journalists attended the April 12 , 1958 inquest , described by attendees as near-riotous . After four hours of testimony and approximately 25 minutes of deliberation , the jury deemed the killing a justifiable homicide . Cheryl remained a temporary ward of the court until April 24 , when a juvenile court hearing was held , during which the judge expressed concerns over her receiving proper parental supervision . She was ultimately released to the care of her grandmother , and was ordered to regularly visit a psychiatrist alongside her parents .",
      "Though Turner and her daughter were exonerated of any wrongdoing , public opinion on the event was varied , with numerous publications intimating that Turners testimony at the inquest was a performance ; Life magazine published a photo of Turner testifying in court along with stills of her in courtroom scenes from three of her films . The scandal also coincided with the release of Another Time , Another Place , and the film was met with poor box-office receipts and a lackluster critical response . Stompanatos family sought a wrongful death suit of $750,000 in damages against both Turner and her ex-husband , Steve Crane . In the suit , Stompanatos son alleged that Turner had been responsible for his death , and that her daughter had taken the blame . The suit was settled out of court for a reported $20,000 in May 1962 . A 1962 novel by Harold Robbins entitled Where Love Has Gone and its subsequent film adaptation were inspired by the event .",
      "1959\u20131965 : Financial successes .",
      "In the wake of negative publicity related to Stompanatos death , Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunters remake of Imitation of Life ( 1959 ) under the direction of Douglas Sirk . She portrayed a struggling stage actress who makes personal sacrifices to further her career . The production was difficult for Turner given the recent events of her personal life , and she suffered a panic attack on the first day of filming . Her co-star Juanita Moore recalled that Turner cried for three days after filming a scene in which Moores character dies . When she returned to the set , her face was so swollen , she couldnt work , Moore said .",
      "Released in the spring of 1959 , Imitation of Life was among the years biggest successes , and the biggest of Turners career ; by opting to receive 50% of the films earnings rather than receiving a salary , she earned more than two million dollars . Imitation of Life made more than $50 million in box office receipts . Reviews were mixed , although Variety praised her performance , writing : Turner plays a character of changing moods , and her changes are remarkably effective , as she blends love and understanding , sincerity and ambition . The growth of maturity is reflected neatly in her distinguished portrayal . Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life both seemed to mirror certain parts of Turners private life , resulting in comparisons she found painful . Both films depicted the troubled , complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenage daughter . During this time , Turners daughter Cheryl privately came out as a lesbian to her parents , who were both supportive of her . Despite this , Cheryl ran away from home multiple times and the press wrote about her rebelliousness . Worried she was still suffering from the trauma of Stompanatos death , Turner sent Cheryl to the Institute of Living in Hartford , Connecticut .",
      "Shortly before the release of Imitation of Life in the spring of 1959 , Turner was cast in a lead role in Otto Premingers Anatomy of a Murder , but walked off the set over a wardrobe disagreement , effectively dropping out of the production . She was replaced by Lee Remick . Instead , Turner took a lead role as a disturbed socialite in the film noir Portrait in Black ( 1960 ) opposite Anthony Quinn and Sandra Dee , which was a box-office success despite bad reviews . Ray Duncan of the Independent Star-News wrote that Turner suffers prettily through it all , like a fashion model with a tight-fitting shoe .",
      "In November 1960 , Turner married her fifth husband , Frederick Fred May , a rancher and member of the May department-store family whom she had met at a beach party in Malibu shortly after filming Imitation of Life . Turner moved in with him on his ranch in Chino , California , where the two took care of horses and other animals . The following year , she made her final film at MGM with Bob Hope in Bachelor in Paradise ( 1961 ) , a romantic comedy about an investigative writer ( Hope ) working on a book about the wives of a lavish California community ; the film received a mostly positive critical reception . Upon completing filming , Turner collected the remaining $92,000 from her pension fund with MGM . The same year , she starred in By Love Possessed ( 1961 ) , based on a bestselling novel by James Gould Cozzens . The film became the first in-flight movie to be shown on a regular basis on a scheduled airline flight when TWA showed it to its first-class passengers .",
      "In mid-1962 , Turner filmed Whos Got the Action? , a comedy in which she portrayed the wife of a gambling addict opposite Dean Martin . In September of that year , Turner and May separated , divorcing shortly after in October . They remained friends throughout her later life . In 1965 , she met Hollywood producer and businessman Robert Eaton , who was ten years her junior , through business associates . The two married in June of that year at his familys home in Arlington , Virginia .",
      "1966\u20131985 : Later films , television and theatre .",
      "In 1966 , Turner had her last major starring role in the courtroom drama film Madame X , based on the 1904 play by Alexandre Bisson , in which Turner portrayed a lower-class woman who marries into a wealthy family . A review in the Chicago Tribune praised her performance , noting : when she takes the stand in the final ( with Keir Dullea ) courtroom scene , her face resembling a dust bowl victory garden , its the most devastating denouement since Barbara Fritchie poked her head out the window . Kaspar Monahan of the Pittsburgh Press lauded her performance , writing : Her performance , I think , is far and away her very best , even rating Oscar consideration in next years Academy Award race , unless the culture snobs gang up against her . The role earned Turner a David di Donatello Golden Plaque Award for Best Foreign Actress that year . In late 1968 , she began filming the low-budget thriller The Big Cube , in which she portrayed a glamorous heiress being dosed with LSD by her stepdaughter in hopes of driving her insane and receiving the family estate . One critic deemed Turners acting in the film strained and amateurish , and declared it one of her poorest performances . In April 1969 , Turner filed for divorce from Eaton after four years of marriage upon discovering he had been unfaithful to her . Weeks later , on May 9 , 1969 , she married Ronald Pellar , a nightclub hypnotist whom she had met at a Los Angeles disco . According to Turner , Pellar ( also known as Ronald Dante or Dr . Dante ) falsely claimed to have been raised in Singapore and to have a Ph.D . in psychology .",
      "With few film offers coming in , Turner signed on to appear in the television series Harold Robbins The Survivors . Premiering in September 1969 , the series was given a major national marketing campaign , with billboards featuring life-sized images of Turner . Despite ABCs extensive publicity campaign and the presence of other big-name stars , the program fared badly , and it was canceled halfway into the season after a 15-week run in 1970 . Meanwhile , after six months of marriage , Turner discovered Pellar had stolen $35,000 she had given him for an investment . In addition , she later accused him of stealing $100,000 worth of jewelry from her . Pellar denied the accusations and no charges were filed against him . She filed for divorce in January 1970 , after which she claimed to be celibate for the remainder of her life . Turner married a total of eight times to seven different husbands , and later famously said : My goal was to have one husband and seven children , but it turned out to be the other way around .",
      "Turner returned to feature films with a lead role in the 1974 British horror film Persecution , in which she played a disturbed wealthy woman tormenting her son . Variety noted of her performance : Under the circumstances , Turners performance as Carrie , the perverted dame of the English manor , has reasonable poise . In April 1975 , Turner spoke at a retrospective gala in New York City examining her career , which was attended by Andy Warhol , Sylvia Miles , Rex Reed and numerous fans . Her next film was Bittersweet Love ( 1976 ) , a romantic comedy in which she portrayed the mother of a woman who unwittingly marries her half-brother . Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times wrote that the film served as a reminder that Miss Turner was never one of our subtler actresses .",
      "In the early 1970s , Turner transitioned to theater , beginning with a production of Forty Carats , which toured various East Coast cities in 1971 . A review in The Philadelphia Inquirer noted : Miss Turner always could wear clothes well , and her Forty Carats is a fashion show in the guise of a frothy , little comedy . It wasnt much of a play even when Julie Harris was doing it , and it all but disappears under the old-time Hollywood glamor of Miss Turners star presence . In 1975 , Turner gave a single performance as Jessica Poole in The Pleasure of His Company opposite Louis Jourdan at the Arlington Park Theater in Chicago . From 1976 to 1978 , she starred in a touring production of Bell , Book and Candle , playing Gillian Holroyd . Critic Elaine Matas noted of a 1977 performance that Turner was brilliant and the bright spot in an otherwise mediocre play . In the fall of 1978 , she appeared in a Chicago production of Divorce Me , Darling , an original play in which she portrayed a San Francisco divorce attorney . During rehearsals , a stagehand told reporters that Turner was the hardest working broad Ive known . Richard Christiansen of the Chicago Tribune praised her performance , writing that , though she is still a very nervous and inexpert actress , she is giving by far her most winning performance .",
      "Between 1979 and 1980 , Turner returned to theater , appearing in Murder Among Friends , a murder-mystery play that showed in various U.S . cities . During this time , Turner was in the midst of a self-described downhill slide . She was suffering from an alcohol addiction that had begun in the late 1950s , was missing performances and weighed only . In 1980 , Turner made her final feature-film appearance alongside Teri Garr in the comedy horror film Witches Brew . The same year , she had what she referred to as a religious awakening , and again began practicing her Catholic faith . On October 25 , 1981 , the National Film Society presented Turner with an Artistry in Cinema award . In December 1981 , it was announced that Turner would appear as the mysterious Jacqueline Perrault in an episode of Falcon Crest , marking her first television role in 12 years . Her appearance was a ratings success , and her character returned for an additional five episodes .",
      "In January 1982 , Turner reprised her role in Murder Among Friends , which toured throughout the U.S . that year ; paired with Bob Fosses Dancin , the play earned a combined gross of $400,000 during one week at Pittsburghs Heinz Hall in June 1982 . In September , Turner released an autobiography entitled . She subsequently guest-starred on an episode of The Love Boat in 1985 , which marked her final on-screen appearance .",
      "1986\u20131995 : Illness and death .",
      "Turner was a regular drinker and cigarette smoker for most of her life . During her contract with MGM , photographs that showed her holding cigarettes had to be airbrushed at the studios request in an effort to conceal her smoking . In her early 60s , Turner stopped drinking to preserve her health , but she was unable to quit smoking . She was diagnosed with throat cancer in the spring of 1992 . In a press release , she stated that the cancer had been detected early and had not damaged her vocal cords or larynx . She underwent exploratory surgery to remove the cancer , but it had metastasized to her jaw and lungs . After undergoing radiation therapy , Turner announced that she was in full remission in early 1993 . The cancer was found to have returned in July 1994 .",
      "In September 1994 , Turner made her final public appearance at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival in Spain to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award , and was confined to a wheelchair for much of the event . She died nine months later at the age of 74 on June 29 , 1995 , of complications from the cancer , at her home in Century City , Los Angeles , with her daughter by her side . According to Cheryl , Turners death was a total shock , as she had appeared to be in better health and had recently completed seven weeks of radiation therapy . Turners remains were cremated and scattered in Oahu , Hawaii .",
      "Cheryl and her life partner Joyce LeRoy , whom Turner said she accepted as a second daughter , inherited some of Turners personal effects and $50,000 in Turners will . Her estate was estimated in court documents to be worth $1.7 million . Turner left the majority of her estate to her maid , Carmen Lopez Cruz , who had been her companion for 45 years and caregiver during her final illness . Cheryl challenged the will , and Cruz said that the majority of the estate was consumed by probate costs , legal fees and medical expenses .",
      "Public and screen persona .",
      "When Turner was discovered , MGM executive Mervyn LeRoy envisioned her as a replacement for the recently deceased Jean Harlow and began developing her image as a sex symbol . In They Wont Forget ( 1937 ) and Love Finds Andy Hardy ( 1938 ) , she embodied an innocent sexuality portraying ing\u00e9nues . Film historian Jeanine Basinger notes that she represented the girl whod rather sit on the diving board to show off her figure than get wet in the water .. . the girl whod rather kiss than kibbitz . In her early films , Turner did not color her auburn hair\u2014see Dancing Co-Ed ( 1939 ) , in which she was billed the red-headed sensation who brought it back to the screen . 1941s Ziegfeld Girl was the first film to showcase Turner with platinum blonde hair , which she wore for much of the remainder of her life and came to be known for .",
      "After Turners first marriage in 1940 , columnist Louella Parsons wrote : If Lana Turner will behave herself and not go completely berserk she is headed for a top spot in motion pictures . She is the most glamorous actress since Jean Harlow . She also likened her to Clara Bow , adding : Both of them , trusting and lovable , use their hearts instead of their heads . Lana .. . has always acted hastily and been guided more by her own ideas than by any advance any studio gave her . By the mid-1940s , Turner had been married and divorced three times , had given birth to her daughter Cheryl and had numerous publicized affairs . However , her image in 1946s The Postman Always Rings Twice marked a departure from her strictly-sex symbol screen persona to that of a full-fledged femme fatale .",
      "By the 1950s , both critics and audiences began noting parallels between Turners rocky personal life and the roles she played . The likeness was most evident in Peyton Place and Imitation of Life , both films in which Turner portrayed single mothers struggling to maintain relationships with their teenage daughters . Film scholar Richard Dyer cites Turner as an example of one of Hollywoods earliest stars whose publicized private life perceptibly inflected their careers : Her career is marked by an unusually , even spectacularly , high degree of interpenetration between her publicly available private life and her films .. . not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image , but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so that by the end of her career films like Peyton Place , Imitation of Life , Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life .",
      "Basinger echoes similar sentiments , noting that Turner was often cast only in roles that were symbolic of what the public knew\u2014or thought they knew\u2014of her life from headlines she made as a person , not as a movie character .. . Her person became her persona . In addition , Basinger credits Turner as the first mainstream female star to take the male prerogative openly for herself , publicly indulging in romances and affairs that in turn fueled the publicity surrounding her . Film scholar Jessica Hope Jordan considers Turner an implosion of both a real-life image and star image and suggests that she utilized one to mask the other , thus rendering her representative of the ultimate femme fatale . Columnist Dorothy Kilgallen took note of the intersections between Turners life and screen persona early in her career , writing in 1946 :",
      "Historians have cited Turner as one of the most glamorous film stars of all time , an association that was made both during her lifetime and after her death . Commenting on her image , she once told a journalist : Forsaking glamour is like forsaking my identity . Its an image Ive worked too hard to obtain and preserve . Michael Gordon , who directed Turner in Portrait in Black , remembered her as a very talented actress whose chief reliability was what I regarded as impoverished taste .. . Lana was not a dummy , and she would give me wonderful rationalizations why she should wear pendant earrings . They had nothing to do with the role , but they had to do with her particular self-image .",
      "According to her daughter , Turners obsessive attention to detail often resulted in dressmakers storming out during dress fittings . No matter the setting , Turner also took care to ensure she was always camera-ready , wearing jewelry and makeup even while lounging in sweatpants . Turner often purchased her favorite styles of shoes in every available color , at one time accumulating 698 pairs . She favored the designers Salvatore Ferragamo , Jean Louis , Helen Rose and Nolan Miller . Film historians Joe Morella and Edward Epstein have observed that , unlike many female stars , Turner wasnt resented by female fans , and that women made up a large part of her fan base in later years . Turner maintained her glamorous image into her late career ; a 1966 film review characterized her as the glitter and glamour of Hollywood . While she consistently embraced her glamorous persona , she was also vocal about her dedication to acting and attained a reputation as a versatile , hard-working performer . She was an admirer of Bette Davis , whom she cited as her favorite actress .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Turner has been noted by historians as a sex symbol , a popular culture icon and a symbol of the American Dream fulfilled .. . Because of her , being discovered at a soda fountain has become almost as cherished an ideal as being born in a log cabin . Critic Leonard Maltin noted in 2005 that Turner came to crystallize the opulent heights to which show business could usher a small-town girl , as well as its darkest , most tragic and narcissistic depths . She has also been cited by scholars as a gay icon because of her glamorous persona and triumphs over personal struggles . While discussions surrounding Turner have largely been based on her cultural prevalence , little scholarly study has been undertaken on her career , and opinion of her legacy as an actress has divided critics . Upon Turners death , John Updike wrote in The New Yorker that she was a faded period piece , an old-fashioned glamour queen whose fifty-four films , over four decades didnt amount , retrospectively to much .. . As a performer , she was purely a studio-made product .",
      "Defenders of Turners acting ability , such as Jessica Hope Jordan and James Robert Parish , cite her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice as an argument for the value of her work . Turners role in the film has also caused her to be frequently associated with film noir and the femme fatale archetype in critical circles . In a 1973 Films in Review retrospective on her career , Turner was referred to as a master of the motion picture technique and a hardworking craftsman . Jeanine Basinger has similarly championed Turners acting , writing of her performance in The Bad and the Beautiful : None of the sex symbols who have been touted as actresses\u2014not Hayworth or Gardner or Taylor or Monroe\u2014have ever given such a fine performance .",
      "Because of the intersections between Turners high-profile , glamorous persona , and storied , often troubled personal life , she is included in critical discussions about the Hollywood studio system , specifically its capitalization on its stars private travails . Basinger considers her the epitome of the Hollywood machine-made stardom . Turner has also been cited in scholarly discussions of womens sexuality .",
      "Turner has been depicted and referenced in numerous works across literature , film , music and art . She was the subject of the poem Lana Turner has collapsed by Frank OHara , and was depicted as a minor character in James Ellroys novel L.A . Confidential ( 1990 ) . The Stompanato murder and its aftermath were also the basis of the Harold Robbins novel Where Love Has Gone ( 1962 ) . In popular music , Turner was referenced in songs recorded by Nina Simone and Frank Sinatra , and was the source of the stage name of singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey .

      "William B . Umstead",
      "William Bradley Umstead ( May 13 , 1895November 7 , 1954 ) was an American politician who served as a United States Senator and the 63rd Governor of North Carolina from 1953 to 1954 .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Umstead was born in the northern Durham County town of Bahama in 1895 . In 1916 , he earned a bachelors degree in history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where , like several of North Carolinas UNC-alumni Governors before him , he was a member of the Philanthropic Society . Reflecting on his time as a Phi , in 1948 Umstead ( then a U.S . Senator ) asserted in an article to the Daily Tar Heel If I had in my hand everything I learned in the halls of [ the Philanthropic Society ] and in my left hand everything I learned in the University , I wouldnt swap my experiences in debating for other things Ive learned here in the University .",
      "Career .",
      "Umstead taught high school history for approximately one school year before joining the army after the U.S . entry into World War I . He served as an officer and saw combat in France ; Umstead was discharged in 1919 as a first lieutenant . He later entered law school at Trinity College ( now Duke University ) . Umstead was a prosecutor for most of his legal career and served as the elected solicitor ( today called district attorney ) for a five-county district from 1927 to 1933 .",
      "He served from 1933 to 1939 in the United States House of Representatives , choosing not to seek re-election in 1938 . Umstead was chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party for several years until he was appointed to fill a vacant United States Senate seat in 1946 . Defeated for a Senate term of his own in 1948 , Umstead ran for governor in 1952 and won .",
      "Umstead spent several weeks preparing his inaugural address . He was inaugurated as Governor of North Carolina on January 8 , 1953 at the Memorial Auditorium . He delivered an hour-long speech outlining his extensive legislative program , including a 10 percent salary increase for public school staff retroactive to 1 July 1952 , passage of a bill requiring vehicle inspections and establishment of a drivers education program in every public high school , bond issues to construct facilities for the treatment and education of the mentally ill and to build schools , and a statewide referendum on the legalization of liquor sales . He also criticized his predecessors road construction program , saying it placed a large financial burden upon the state . Umstead was exhausted by the days ceremonies and was feeling ill , but he stood to greet visitors at the Executive Mansion for four hours and attended a ball in the evening .",
      "Umstead spent most of the following day getting his office in order , and on January 10 he went to work in his Durham law firm before retiring to his home near Bahama in the evening . He called a doctor when he could not fall asleep due to a cough , and after midnight he was taken to Watts Hospital in Durham . Once there , his doctor discovered that he had suffered a heart attack and was close to developing pneumonia . His doctor released a statement saying that the governor had suffered a mild attack of heart trouble and was quickly improving , hoping to be released in 12 to 15 days . Leaders in the North Carolina General Assembly were unsure if they should proceed with their session while Umstead was hospitalized , but he insisted they begin their work while at the same time giving no instructions to the presiding officer of the Senate , Lieutenant Governor Luther H . Hodges . The two men had tense relations since their campaigns , when Umstead sought to distance himself from Hodges . Umstead also gave Hodges no indications of his legislative agenda , and ignored him throughout his term .",
      "Umstead remained in the hospital for 27 days and returned to the Executive Mansion under the condition that he stay in bed and work limited hours . He had his brother John and former Speaker of the House W . Frank Taylor direct most of his legislative program . Small groups of legislators would visit him in his bedroom to discuss his plans . He never fully recovered from his heart attack and remained unwell . In June 1953 U.S . Senator Willis Smith died . The media immediately began speculating about who Umstead would appoint to serve the remaining 18 months of Willis term . Umstead said little publicly other than that his choice would be of someone with agricultural concerns and respect North Carolinas traditional east-west balance in representation in government . North Carolinas other senator , Clyde Hoey , hailed from the western portion of the state , so it was assumed that Umstead would nominate an easterner . On July 10 Umstead made the surprise appointment of Alton Lennon to the office , a lawyer from Wilmington who had worked on Umsteads Senate and gubernatorial campaigns . Umsteads friends suggested that the governor had made the decision simply to get over with it , while observers speculated that Lennon was intended to be a dark horse candidate who could prevail through the next Senate election by being attached to Umsteads popularity .",
      "Hoey died on May 12 , 1954 , thus presenting Umstead with the chance to fill a second U.S . Senate vacancy , an opportunity not afforded to a governor in the United States since 1936 . Shortly thereafter the Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in Brown v . Board of Education , ruling that the racial segregation of public schools was unconstitutional . Umstead was angered by the decision , feeling the court had overstepped its bounds and undercut states rights to spend their own money , but he believed in the rule of law and felt obligated not to dismiss the ruling out of hand . He also thought a charged public response would be undignified and politically risky . In June , 1954 , Umstead appointed Sam Ervin to fill Hoeys vacancy .",
      "Death .",
      "Umsteads health declined over the course of his term , worsened by his insistence on his strenuous amount of work . On the afternoon of November 4 Umstead , feeling ill , retired from his office to his bed in the Executive Mansion . His doctor ordered him to be taken to Watts Hospital , while the governors office released a statement saying a severe cold had disturbed Umsteads heart . Umstead packed a briefcase full of documents so he could continue to work while hospitalized , but his health did not improve and he did not open the briefcase while at Watts . He died there at 9:10 AM on November 7 with his wife and daughter at his side . A funeral was held two days later and immediately afterwards Hodges was sworn-in as Governor of North Carolina . Umstead is buried in the Mount Tabor Church Cemetery in Mangum Township near Bahama .",

      "Steele Hall",
      "Raymond Steele Hall ( born 30 November 1928 ) is a former Australian politician who served as the 36th Premier of South Australia from 1968 to 1970 . He also served in the federal Parliament as a senator for South Australia from 1974 to 1977 and federal member for the Division of Boothby from 1981 to 1996 .",
      "Hall was a state parliamentarian from 1959 to 1974 , serving as Liberal and Country League ( LCL ) leader from 1966 to 1972 and premier from 1968 to 1970 . He introduced electoral reform , removing the Playmander which favoured the LCL , which contributed to his partys loss at the 1970 South Australian state election . In 1972 he founded the Liberal Movement ( LM ) , and resigned from the LCL when the LM split from the LCL in 1973 . He continued as a state parliamentarian until he resigned his seat in 1974 to be the LMs lead senate candidate at the 1974 Australian federal election .",
      "Hall won a senate seat for the LM at both the 1974 and 1975 elections . After the LM disbanded in 1976 he rejoined the Liberal Party , as it was now called in South Australia , and he resigned from the senate in 1977 to contest the seat of Hawker at the 1977 Federal election , but was unsuccessful . In 1981 he won the seat of Boothby at the 1981 by-election , and remained the Liberal member for Boothby until his retirement in 1996 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Hall was born on 30 November 1928 in Balaklava , South Australia , the son of Florence ( n\u00e9e Fisher ) and Sidney Hall . He attended primary school in Owen and subsequently graduated from Balaklava High School . After leaving school he worked on the family property in Owen , a sheep and wheat farm .",
      "Political career .",
      "State politics .",
      "Hall was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Liberal and Country League ( LCL ) member for Gouger ( later renamed Goyder ) at the 1959 election . Quickly gaining a reputation for his independence and strength of his views , Hall rose through the LCL parliamentary ranks to assume party leadership following Sir Thomas Playfords retirement in July 1966 . Playford , who had earlier served as premier for 26 years , endorsed Hall as his successor . Although Hall was considerably more progressive than Playford , the two men shared a background as small farmers , rather than members of the rural elite or the prestigious Adelaide establishment .",
      "Hall served as Leader of the Opposition for two years before leading the LCL into the 1968 election . Considered young and handsome , he was also the first Australian state premier to sport sideburns . Indeed , the 1968 election , fought between Hall and his Labor opponent Don Dunstan , was described by the Democratic Labor Party as the battle of the matinee idols . The election resulted in a hung parliament , with Labor and the LCL winning 19 seats each . LCL-leaning independent Tom Stott announced his support for the LCL . Dunstan and Labor were defeated in the legislature on 17 April , and Hall was sworn in as premier later that day .",
      "Hall immediately set out to deal with the issue of electoral reform . Deliberately inequitable electoral boundaries , called the Playmander , had greatly advantaged the LCL over the past 40 years . Since 1932 , the House of Assembly had 39 members\u201413 from the Adelaide area and 26 from country areas . However , by the 1960s , even though Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the states population , a vote in Adelaide was effectively worth only half a country vote . Hall was highly embarrassed that the LCL had been in a position to win government despite winning 43.8% of the first preference vote compared to Labors 52% . He was also concerned by the level of publicity and growing public protest about the issue . This made him all the more committed to the principle of a fairer electoral system .",
      "Hall sponsored an electoral reform bill which expanded the House of Assembly to 47 seats , including 28 in the Adelaide area . It fell short of one vote one value , as Dunstan and Labor had demanded , since rural areas were still overrepresented . As mentioned above , Adelaide now contained two-thirds of the states population . Nevertheless , it was a much fairer system than its predecessor . Hall undertook this knowing that it would considerably strengthen Labors hand . Even at the height of the LCLs popularity under Playford , Labor had dominated Adelaide , with the LCL only able to win a few seats in the eastern crescent and around Holdfast Bay . With Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature , conventional wisdom held that Hall pushed for electoral reform knowing that he was effectively handing the premiership to Dunstan at the next election .",
      "Whatever the public outcry over the electoral inequalities , Halls political bravery in introducing legislation to reform the House of Assembly to a more equitable system of representation should not be underestimated . It ranks as one of the few instances in Australian political history when a politician initiated a reform knowing full well that it would put his own party at a disadvantage .",
      "In addition to electoral reform , Hall also introduced improvements in social welfare , aboriginal affairs and abortion regulation . Hall also began the distribution of fluoridated water in South Australia in 1968 .",
      "Hall served as his own Treasurer for two months in 1970 . Hall and Stott soon fell out over the location of a dam . Stott wanted the dam built in his electorate while Hall thought it more use to locate it elsewhere . Constituent anger forced Stott to vote against the Hall government , forcing an election for June 1970 . As expected , Labor regained power , taking 27 seats to the LCLs 20 . As a measure of how distorted the Playmander had been , Labor won easily despite picking up a swing of only 0.1 percent .",
      "Hall remained Leader of the Opposition for two years before resigning from the LCL on 15 March 1972 , claiming that the party had lost its idealism [ and ] forgotten...its purpose for existence . He founded the Liberal Movement , a progressive liberal party that initially included about 200 former LCL members . Hall and his fellow LM members helped the Dunstan Government introduce adult suffrage and proportional representation for Legislative Council of South Australia elections .",
      "Federal politics .",
      "Hall won a federal Senate seat for the Liberal Movement at the double dissolution 1974 election , after resigning his state seat , which sparked a Goyder by-election . At the Joint Sitting of Parliament , Hall supported the Labor governments three electoral reform Bills , citing his experience as South Australian Premier . During the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis , though opposed to the Whitlam government , Hall joined Labor ( and independent Cleaver Bunton ) in voting against the deferral of supply bills .",
      "Hall was re-elected at the 1975 election . He became a member of the Liberal Party in June 1976 after the Liberal Movement reintegrated into the LCL , which was renamed to match with its interstate counterparts . He resigned from the Senate on 16 November 1977 to unsuccessfully contest the seat of Hawker in the House of Representatives . Premier Dunstan appointed Janine Haines of the Australian Democrats to replace him .",
      "After four years out of politics , Hall won the 1981 Boothby by-election as the Liberal Partys candidate .",
      "In August 1988 , after the then opposition leader John Howard expressed his wish to control Asian immigration in Australia ,",
      "Steele Hall ( along with Ian Macphee and Philip Ruddock ) dissented by crossing the floor of parliament and voting with the Labor government on a motion against the use of race as a criterion for selecting immigrants .",
      "Steele Hall addressed the Parliament , saying :",
      "Hall held Boothby until his retirement at the 1996 election . He had been instrumental in blocking Liberal Senate leader Senator Robert Hill to succeed him in the Liberal preselection contest for Boothby . The preselection went instead to Andrew Southcott , who succeeded Hall in the seat in 1996 .",
      "Despite being a former South Australian Premier , Hall spent most of his time as a federal Liberal MP on the backbench .",
      "His antagonism with Malcolm Fraser meant it was unlikely he would become part of the Fraser Ministry .",
      "In Opposition , Liberal leader Andrew Peacock appointed him to the frontbench as Shadow Special Minister of State in 1983 but was not reappointed to the frontbench after the 1984 election .",
      "Hall then returned to the backbench where he remained for the remainder of his parliamentary career including when fellow South Australian Alexander Downer became leader in 1994 . Hall had defeated Downer for Liberal preselection for the 1981 Boothby by-election .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Hall married schoolteacher Anne Fletcher in 1956 , with whom he had one son and three daughters . They were divorced in 1978 , and later that year he married his research assistant Joan Bullock . The couple had one son and one daughter together . Joan was elected to the South Australian parliament in 1993 .",

      "Cueva de las Manos",
      "Cueva de las Manos ( Spanish for Cave of the Hands or Cave of Hands ) is a cave and complex of rock art sites in the province of Santa Cruz , Argentina , south of the town of Perito Moreno . It is named for the hundreds of hand paintings stenciled into multiple collages on the rock walls . The art in the cave dates to between 11,000 to 7,000 BC , during the Archaic period of Pre-Columbian South America , or the late Pleistocene to early Holocene geological periods . Several waves of people occupied the cave over time as evidenced by some of the early artwork that has been radiocarbon dated to about 7300 BC . The age of the paintings was calculated from the remains of bone-made pipes used for spraying the paint on the wall of the cave to create the stenciled artwork of the hand collages . The site is considered to be the best material evidence of South American early hunter-gatherer groups by some scholars .",
      "The site was last inhabited around 700 AD , possibly by ancestors of the Tehuelche people . Argentine surveyor and archaeologist Carlos J . Gradin and his team conducted the most important research on the site in 1964 , when they began excavating sites during a 30-year study of cave art in and around Cueva de las Manos . The importance of his discoveries to the countrys natural and cultural heritage resulted in the site being named a United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) World Heritage Site in 1999 . The site is also a National Historic Monument and a National Historic Site in Argentina .",
      "Location .",
      "The cave lies in the valley of the Pinturas River , in an isolated location in the Patagonian landscape . The area itself is on the upper part of the Deseado Basin , at the base of a stepped cliff in the Pinturas Canyon . It lies around south of Perito Moreno , a town in northwest Santa Cruz Province , Argentina . The site is part of Perito Moreno National Park .",
      "Climate .",
      "The climate of the cave area can best be described as precordilleran steppe ( or grassy foothills ) . The climate is cold and dry , with very low humidity ; the area receives a total annual precipitation of less than per year . The topography of the canyon prevents the strong westward winds that are natural to the region , making winters in the area less severe .",
      "Access .",
      "The cave is most easily reached by a gravel road , which leaves Ruta 40 ( Route 40 ) north of Bajo Caracoles and runs northeast to the south side of the Pinturas Canyon . The north side of the canyon can be reached by rough , but shorter , roads from Ruta 40 . A path connects the two sides of the canyon , but there is no road link .",
      "History .",
      "The Pinturas and Deseado Rivers drained into the Atlantic Ocean , and provided water for herds of guanacos , making the area attractive to Paleoindians . As the glacial ice fields melted , the Baker River captured the drainage of the eastward flowing rivers and redirected the flow to the Pacific Ocean . This led to a progressive abandonment of the Las Manos site .",
      "Projectile points , a bola stone fragment , and side-scrapers have been found alongside guanaco , puma , foxes , birds and other small animals remains at the site . The natives used bolas and ambush tactics to hunt guanacos , their primary food source . The Pre-Columbian economy of Patagonia as a whole depended on hunting-gathering . Francisco Mena states in Middle to Late Holocene Adaptations in Patagonia that neither agriculture nor fully fledged pastoralism ever emerged . Carlos Gradin remarked in his writings that all the rock art in the area shows the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of the artists who made it .",
      "Various groups inhabited the Las Manos site , including the long since vanished Toldense people who lived in the caves until the third or second millennium BC . The site was last inhabited around 700 AD , with the last of the cave dwellers possibly being ancestors of the Tehuelche tribes . The existence of obsidian in the area\u2014which is not natural to the region\u2014implies a broad-ranging network of trade between peoples of the cave area and distant tribal groups .",
      "Father Alberto Maria de Agostini first wrote about the site in 1941 AD .",
      "Cave .",
      "The main cave is about deep , and is composed of the cave itself , two outcroppings , and the walls at either side of the entrance . The entrance faces approximately northeast and is about in height by wide . The paintings on the caves wall span about . The initial height of the cave is . The ground inside has an upward slope thus the height is reduced to no more than .",
      "Artwork .",
      "Cueva de las Manos is named for the hundreds of hand paintings stenciled into multiple collages on the rock walls . The art in the Cueva de las Manos is some of the most important art in the New World , and by far the most famous among rock art in the Patagonian region . The art dates to between 11,000 to 7,000 BC , during the Archaic period of Pre-Columbian South America , or the late Pleistocene to early Holocene geological periods . The oldest-known cave paintings in South America are contained within the cave .",
      "The artwork not only decorates the interior of the cave but also the surrounding cliff faces and exterior . The caves art can be divided by subject into three basic categories : people , the animals they ate , and the human hand . Inhabitants of the Las Manos site hunted guanacos for survival ; a dependency that is reflected in their artwork as totemic-like depictions of the creatures .",
      "The artworks authenticity has been verified . Several waves of people occupied the cave over time as evidenced by some of the early artwork that has been radiocarbon dated to about 7300 BC . The age of the paintings was calculated from the remains of bone-made pipes used for spraying the paint on the wall of the cave to create the stenciled artwork of the hand collages . According to Fanning et al. , it is the best material evidence of early hunter gatherer groups in South America .",
      "Forms .",
      "The works in the cave can be described as naturalistic . Over time , they gradually became more stylized .",
      "There are over 2,000 handprints in and around the cave . Most of the images are painted as negatives or stencilled , alongside some positive handprints . A survey in the 1970s counted 829 left hands to 31 right . This suggests that painters held the spray pipe ( possibly made from a bird bone ) with their right hand . Some hands are missing fingers , which could be due to necrosis , amputation , or deformity , but might indicate the use of sign language or bending fingers to convey meaning .",
      "The varying depth of the rock face forms the literal space of the works , and the different depths from the viewer alters the way the images are seen based on where the viewer is standing . There is a large amount of superimpositioning ( overlap ) of the hands in different areas as well , with some areas of the art containing so much that the hands form a palimpsest background of layered color . Along with the superimpositioned masses of images , there are many purposefully placed single hands .",
      "There are also depictions of human beings , guanacos ( Lama guanicoe ) , rheas , felines and other animals , as well as geometric shapes , zigzag patterns , representations of the sun , and hunting scenes . The hunting scenes are naturalistic portrayals of a variety of hunting techniques , including the use of bolas . Similar paintings , though in smaller numbers , can be found in nearby caves . There are also red dots on the ceilings , probably made by submerging their hunting bolas in ink , and then throwing them up .",
      "The same wildlife depicted in the artwork exists in the area today . Most prominent among the animals are the guanacos , upon which the natives depended for survival . There are repeated scenes of guanacos being surrounded as they are hunted , suggesting that this was the preferred tactic for killing the creatures .",
      "Cultural Context .",
      "Little is known about the culture of those who made these works aside from the tools they used and what they hunted . One is left to speculate about their culture and what life was like in the societies that created it . The art shows the people of this area were not merely restricted to stone tools and subsistence , but had a symbolic element to their culture .",
      "Purpose .",
      "The exact function or purpose of this art is unknown , although some findings have suggested it may have had a religious or ceremonial purpose as well as a decorative one . Some would say that hands are indicative of the human desire to be remembered , or to record that they were there . That so many people contributed to the artwork for thousands of years suggests the cave held great significance for the artists who painted on its walls . The fact that a large number of people gathered in one place to contribute to the rock art for such a long period , shows a large cultural significance , or at least usefulness , to those who participated .",
      "Materials .",
      "The binder used in the artwork is unknown but the mineral pigments include iron oxides , producing reds and purples ; kaolin , producing white ; natrojarosite , producing yellow ; manganese oxide ( pyrolusite ) , which makes black ; and copper oxide , making green . Haematite , goethite , and green earth have also been detected . Moreover , Wainwright et al . state that gypsum , quartz , and calcium oxalate have been admixed with the pigments .",
      "Stylistic Groups .",
      "Significant research and archaeology on the rock art of the cave has led specialists to categorize the art into four stylistic groups , proposed by Carlos Gradin and adapted and modified by others : A , B , B1 , and C , also known as R\u00edo Pinturas I , II , III , and IV , respectively . These stylistic groups , separated into three phases of production , cover a time period of around eight millennia . The first two groups were partly conceived to differentiate group As dynamic depiction of guanacos from group Bs static depiction of them .",
      "Stylistic Group A .",
      "Stylistic Group A ( also known as R\u00edo Pinturas I ) is the art of the first hunter-gatherers who lived in the area , and is the oldest style in the cave , which can be traced as far back to around 7,300 BC . The style is naturalistic and dynamic , and encompasses polychrome , dynamic hunting scenes along with negative human hand motifs . The imagery takes advantage of the grooves in the rock face itself to form part of the art . The hunters depicted in the scenes were likely long distance hunters , and the hunting scenes often depicted ambush or surround tactics being used when hunting guanacos .",
      "It is likely that the eruption of the Hudson volcano around 4770/4675 BC caused the end of this stylistic group .",
      "Stylistic Groups B and B1 .",
      "A new cultural group , entering the scene before 5,000 BC , until around 1,300 BC , created the art of what is now considered stylistic groups B ( R\u00edo Pinturas II ) and B1 ( R\u00edo Pinturas III ) .",
      "Around 5,000 BC , Group B was born . Static , isolated groups of guanacos with large bellies , possibly pregnant , replace the lively hunting scenes that marked the previous group . Large groups of superimposed handprints , numbering around 2,000 , in many colors , are associated with Group B , as are some more rare motifs of human and animal footprints .",
      "In Group B1 , composing what could be considered the latter part of Group B , the forms become more and more schematic , and figures , human and animal , become more stylized ; the group includes hand stencils , bola marks , and dotted line patterns .",
      "Stylistic Group C .",
      "Stylistic Group C , R\u00edo Pinturas IV , begins around 700 AD and marks the last of the stylistic sequences in the cave . The group focuses around abstract geometric figures including highly schematic silhouettes of both animal and human figures , alongside circles , zigzag patterns , dots , and more hands superimposed onto larger groups of hands . The primary color is red .",
      "Cultural impact .",
      "Every February the nearby town of Moreno hosts a celebration in honor of the caves . Significant numbers of tourists visit the cave , which is known worldwide . The sites addition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site has contributed to this effect , acting as a type of quality seal for potential tourists and the global cultural tourism industry . The cave and its paintings have served as the inspiration and setting for the popular childrens book Ghost Hands , written by T . A . Barron and illustrated by William Low .",
      "Studies and preservation .",
      "Argentine surveyor and archaeologist Carlos Gradin and his team conducted the most profound research on the site in 1964 , when they began a 30-year-long study of the caves and their art . In his studies , Gradin has helped to separate the different stylistic sequences of the cave .",
      "Cueva de las Manos is a National Historic Monument in Argentina , and has been listed as a National Historic Site since 1993 . It has also been listed as a World Heritage Site since 1999 .",
      "The park faces new setbacks to its preservation in recent times , particularly from tourism . The number of tourists visiting the site has increased by a factor of four since its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1999 . This large influx of tourists has brought new challenges for those seeking to preserve the site . Currently , the most significant threat is graffiti . Other forms of vandalism , such as visitors taking pieces of painted rock from the walls and touching the paintings with their hands , have also left damage and contributed to the overall negative impact of tourism .",
      "In response to these issues , the site is closed off with chain-link fencing with a boardwalk to secure the site from the demands of increased ecotourism . The boardwalk helps to control the movements of visitors and serves as a convenient walkway . The site has also been equipped with sanctioned walking trails , a guide lodge , railings and a parking lot . A team of professionals from Argentinas National Anthropological Institute ( INAPL ) and the National Scientific and Technical Research Council ( CONICET ) supervised the construction of these facilities . An awareness program has also been undertaken to educate tourists and visitors to the site , including local guides , and to facilitate greater involvement by local communities . To access the site , visitors must be accompanied by a tour guide .",
      "Despite these essential measures taken to protect the site , the local provincial government , the Argentinian government , and the UNESCO have been criticized for not doing enough to protect it by falling short of the recommendations of the INAPL ."

      "Pskov ( ; see also names in other languages ) is a city in northwestern Russia and the administrative center of Pskov Oblast , located about east from the Estonian border , on the Velikaya River . Population :",
      "Pskov is one of the oldest cities in Russia . It served as the capital of the Pskov Republic and was a trading post of the Hanseatic League . Later it came under the control of the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the subsequent Russian Empire .",
      "History .",
      "Early history .",
      "Pskov is one of the oldest cities in Russia . The name of the city , originally Pleskov ( historic Russian spelling , Pl\u011bskov ) , may be loosely translated as [ the town ] of purling waters . It was historically known in English as Plescow . Its earliest mention comes in 903 , which records that Igor of Kiev married a local lady , St . Olga . Pskovians sometimes take this year as the citys foundation date , and in 2003 a great jubilee took place to celebrate Pskovs 1,100th anniversary .",
      "The first prince of Pskov was Vladimir the Greats youngest son Sudislav . Once imprisoned by his brother Yaroslav , he was not released until the latters death several decades later . In the 12th and 13th centuries , the town adhered politically to the Novgorod Republic . In 1241 , it was taken by the Teutonic Knights , but Alexander Nevsky recaptured it several months later during a legendary campaign dramatized in Sergei Eisensteins 1938 movie Alexander Nevsky .",
      "In order to secure their independence from the knights , the Pskovians elected a Lithuanian prince , named Daumantas , a Roman Catholic converted to Orthodox faith and known in Russia as Dovmont , as their military leader and prince in 1266 . Having fortified the town , Daumantas routed the Teutonic Knights at Rakvere and overran much of Estonia . His remains and sword are preserved in the local kremlin , and the core of the citadel , erected by him , still bears the name of Dovmonts town .",
      "Pskov Republic .",
      "By the 14th century , the town functioned as the capital of a de facto sovereign republic . Its most powerful force was the merchants who traded with the Hanseatic League . Pskovs independence was formally recognized by Novgorod in 1348 . Several years later , the veche promulgated a law code ( called the Pskov Charter ) , which was one of the principal sources of the all-Russian law code issued in 1497 .",
      "For Russia , the Pskov Republic was a bridge towards Europe ; for Europe , it was a western outpost of Russia . Already in the 13th century German merchants were present in Zapskovye area of Pskov and the Hanseatic League had a trading post in the same area in the first half of 16th century which moved to Zavelichye after a fire in 1562 . The wars with Livonian Order , Poland-Lithuania and Sweden interrupted the trade but it was maintained until the 17th century , with Swedish merchants gaining the upper hand eventually .",
      "The importance of the city made it the subject of numerous sieges throughout its history . The Pskov Krom ( or Kremlin ) withstood twenty-six sieges in the 15th century alone . At one point , five stone walls ringed it , making the city practically impregnable . A local school of icon-painting flourished , and the local masons were considered the best in Russia . Many peculiar features of Russian architecture were first introduced in Pskov .",
      "Part of Muscovy .",
      "Finally , in 1510 , the city was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow . Three hundred families were deported from Pskov to central Russia and merchants and military families from Muscovy were settled in the city . At this time Pskov had at least 6,500 households and the population of more than 30,000 and was one of the three biggest cities of Muscovy , alongside Moscow and Novgorod .",
      "The deportation of noble families to Moscow under Ivan IV in 1570 is a subject of Rimsky-Korsakovs opera Pskovityanka ( 1872 ) . Pskov still attracted enemy armies and it withstood a prolonged siege by a 50,000-strong Polish-Lithuanian army during the final stage of the Livonian War ( 1581\u20131582 ) . The king of Poland Stephen B\u00e1thory undertook some thirty-one attacks to storm the city , which was defended mainly by civilians . Even after one of the city walls was broken , the Pskovians managed to fill the gap and repel the attack . A big city , it is like Paris , wrote B\u00e1thorys secretary about Pskov .",
      "The estimates of the population of Pskov land in the middle of 16th century range from 150 to 300 thousand . Famines , epidemics ( especially the epidemic of 1552 ) and the warfare led to a five-fold decrease of the population by 1582-1585 due to mortality and migration .",
      "The city withstood a siege by the Swedish in 1615 . The successful defence of the city led to the peace negotiations culminating in the Treaty of Stolbovo .",
      "Modern history .",
      "Peter the Greats conquest of Estonia and Livonia during the Great Northern War in the early 18th century spelled the end of Pskovs traditional role as a vital border fortress and a key to Russias interior . As a consequence , the citys importance and well-being declined dramatically , although it served as a seat of separate Pskov Governorate since 1777 .",
      "During World War I , Pskov became the center of much activity behind the lines . It was at a railroad siding in Pskov , aboard the imperial train , that Tsar Nicholas II signed the manifesto announcing his abdication in March 1917 , and after the Russo-German Brest-Litovsk Peace Conference ( December 22 , 1917 \u2013 March 3 , 1918 ) , the Imperial German Army invaded the area . Pskov was also occupied by the Estonian army between 25 May 1919 and 28 August 1919 during the Estonian War of Independence when the White Russian commander Stanis\u0142aw Bu\u0142ak-Ba\u0142achowicz became the military administrator of Pskov . He personally ceded most of his responsibilities to a democratically elected municipal duma and focused on both cultural and economical recovery of the war-impoverished city . He also put an end to censorship of press and allowed for creation of several socialist associations and newspapers .",
      "Under the Soviet government , large parts of the city were rebuilt , many ancient buildings , particularly churches , were demolished to give space for new constructions . During World War II , the medieval citadel provided little protection against modern artillery of Wehrmacht , and Pskov suffered substantial damage during the German occupation from July 9 , 1941 until July 23 , 1944 . A huge portion of the population died during the war , and Pskov has since struggled to regain its traditional position as a major industrial and cultural center of Western Russia .",
      "Administrative and municipal status .",
      "Pskov is the administrative center of the oblast and , within the framework of administrative divisions , it also serves as the administrative center of Pskovsky District , even though it is not a part of it . As an administrative division , it is incorporated separately as the City of Pskov\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts . As a municipal division , the City of Pskov is incorporated as Pskov Urban Okrug .",
      "Landmarks and sights .",
      "Pskov still preserves much of its medieval walls , built from the 13th century on . Its medieval citadel is called either the Krom or the Kremlin . Within its walls rises the Trinity Cathedral , founded in 1138 and rebuilt in the 1690s . The cathedral contains the tombs of saint princes Vsevolod ( died in 1138 ) and Dovmont ( died in 1299 ) . Other ancient cathedrals adorn the Mirozhsky Monastery ( completed by 1152 ) , famous for its 12th-century frescoes , St . Johns ( completed by 1243 ) , and the Snetogorsky monastery ( built in 1310 and stucco-painted in 1313 ) .",
      "Pskov is exceedingly rich in tiny , squat , picturesque churches , dating mainly from the 15th and the 16th centuries . There are many dozens of them , the most notable being St . Basils on the Hill ( 1413 ) , St . Kozma and Demians near the Bridge ( 1463 ) , St . Georges from the Downhill ( 1494 ) , Assumption from the Ferryside ( 1444 , 1521 ) , and St . Nicholas from Usokha ( 1536 ) . The 17th-century residential architecture is represented by merchant mansions , such as the Salt House , the Pogankin Palace , and the Trubinsky mansion .",
      "Among the sights in the vicinity of Pskov are Izborsk , a seat of Ruriks brother in the 9th century and one of the most formidable fortresses of medieval Russia ; the Pskov Monastery of the Caves , the oldest continually functioning monastery in Russia ( founded in the mid-15th century ) and a magnet for pilgrims from all over the country ; the 16th-century Krypetsky Monastery ; Yelizarov Convent , which used to be a great cultural and literary center of medieval Russia ; and Mikhaylovskoye , a family home of Alexander Pushkin where he wrote some of the best known lines in the Russian language . The national poet of Russia is buried in the ancient cloister at the Holy Mountains nearby . Unfortunately , the area presently has only a minimal tourist infrastructure , and the historic core of Pskov requires serious investments to realize its great tourist potential .",
      "On 7 July 2019 , the Churches of the Pskov School of Architecture was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site .",
      "Geography .",
      "Climate .",
      "The climate of Pskov is humid continental ( K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb ) with maritime influences due to the citys relative proximity to the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland ; with relatively mild ( for Russia ) but still quite long winter and warm summer . Summer and fall have more precipitation than winter and spring .",

      "Province of Brandenburg",
      "The Province of Brandenburg ( ) was a province of Prussia from 1815 to 1945 . Brandenburg was established in 1815 from the Kingdom of Prussias core territory , comprised the bulk of the historic Margraviate of Brandenburg ( excluding Altmark ) and the Lower Lusatia region , and became part of the German Empire in 1871 . From 1918 , Brandenburg was a province of the Free State of Prussia until it was dissolved in 1945 after World War II , and replaced with reduced territory as the State of Brandenburg in East Germany , which was later dissolved in 1952 . Following the reunification of Germany in 1990 , Brandenburg was re-established as a federal state of Germany , becoming one of the new states .",
      "Brandenburgs provincial capital alternated between Potsdam , Berlin , and Charlottenburg during its existence .",
      "Geography .",
      "The province comprised large parts of the North German Plain , stretching from the Elbe river in the west to beyond the Oder in the east , where the Neumark region bordered on the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen ( Province of Posen from 1848 ) . Other neighbouring provinces were Pomerania in the northeast , Silesia in the southeast , and Prussian Saxony in the southwest . Brandenburg also shared a common border with the grand duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz in the northwest as well as with Anhalt in the west .",
      "Beside the Elbe and Oder river areas , the province covered large parts of the Spree and Havel basin . The largest cities were Berlin , located in the centre together with the growing suburbs of Spandau , Charlottenburg , Sch\u00f6neberg and Neuk\u00f6lln . Larger towns were the royal residence Potsdam and the regional capital Frankfurt ( Oder ) , furthermore Landsberg ( present-day Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski ) in the east , the historic capital Brandenburg an der Havel as well as Cottbus , Forst and Guben ( Gubin ) in Lower Lusatia .",
      "History .",
      "The first people who are known to have inhabited Brandenburg were the Germanic Suebi . During the Migration Period , they were succeeded by the Polabian Slavs , whose fortress at Brandenburg an der Havel was conquered by the German king Henry the Fowler in 928/29 . Henry subdued the Slavic tribes up to the Oder river and his son Otto I established the marca Geronis on their territory , with the government first conferred to the Saxon count Gero .",
      "The Northern March was split off in 965 , however , large parts were again lost in the Great Slav Rising of 983 , and the margravial title did not become hereditary until the time of Albert the Bear , another Saxon count from the noble House of Ascania , who established the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1157 . His son Margrave Otto I already achieved the dignity of an Arch-Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Empire in 1177 . Emperor Charles IV by the Golden Bull of 1356 confirmed the electoral dignity of the Brandenburg margraves and in 1373 assigned the electorate to his son Wenceslaus in 1373 . The Elector of Brandenburg held the seventh rank among the electors of the Empire and had five votes in the Council of Princes .",
      "In 1415 Brandenburg was acquired by Burgrave Frederick of Nuremberg , the first member of the Swabian House of Hohenzollern to rule the margraviate . Over the centuries , the Hohenzollerns gradually rose to one of the most important dynasties of the Empire , rivalling with the ruling House of Habsburg , a process that intensified with the Protestant Reformation and the inheritance of the Polish Duchy of Prussia in 1618 . The margraviate formed the core of the Brandenburg-Prussian state and the Great Elector Frederick William I made various accessions to the territory , the Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg of 1656 marking a significant turn in its evolution . By the 1657 Treaty of Wehlau , Frederick William reached full sovereignty in his Prussian territories , which enabled his son Frederick I to assume the crown of a King in Prussia in 1701 .",
      "Establishment .",
      "The margraviate remained a constituent part of Prussia , until after the Napoleonic Wars and the 1815 Congress of Vienna the kingdoms administration was divided into ten provinces . Most of the Margraviates territory was incorporated into the new Province of Brandenburg , most notably the Mittelmark between the rivers Elbe and Oder and the Neumark region east of the Oder River . However , the Altmark on the western bank of the Elbe was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Saxony . The Province of Brandenburg also encompassed the territory of Lower Lusatia ( where Cottbus had been a Brandenburgian exclave since the 15th century ) as well as the area around Belzig and J\u00fcterbog , all annexed from the Kingdom of Saxony for her alliance with Napoleon .",
      "The Province headed by an Oberpr\u00e4sident was subdivided into two governorates ( Regierungsbezirke ) named after their respective capitals , Potsdam in the northwest ( Mittelmark , Prignitz and Uckermark ) and Frankfurt ( Oder ) in the southeast ( Neumark and Lower Lusatia ) . The provincial government was at first situated at the Potsdam royal residence . In 1827 , it moved to Berlin , returned to Potsdam in 1843 and in 1918 finally settled in Charlottenburg . The Prussian capital Berlin originally formed part of the Province , but in the course of the Industrial Revolution from the 1830s onwards quickly developed to a metropolis , from 1871 as capital of the German Empire , and on 1 April 1881 was made an autonomous city district ( Stadtkreis Berlin ) .",
      "In contrast , the rural outer regions , though serfdom had been officially abolished by the 1807 Prussian reforms , was still characterised by large\u2013scale land holding of the Junker nobility , similar to the eastern Prussian provinces of Silesia and Pomerania . The conditions in the countryside remained largely untouched , even during the Revolutions of 1848 that led to violent fights in the streets of Berlin . The large estates had to deal with low soil quality and\u2014except for brown coal occurrences in Lower Lusatia\u2014the lack of natural resources . The provincial life was perpetuated in the novels by Theodor Fontane and especially in his 1862\u201389 descriptive work Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg .",
      "Free State of Prussia .",
      "After World War I and the resolutions of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles , the Province of Brandenburg shifted to the eastern edge of the German Weimar Republic , sharing a long common border with the Second Polish Republic . In 1920 , the Greater Berlin Act expanded the borders of Berlin , incorporating numerous surrounding districts and towns from Brandenburg to form Greater Berlin ( Gro\u00df-Berlin ) with a population of about 2,000,000 , including the former town of Charlottenburg , the seat of Brandenburgs provincial government . The Great Depression helped the Nazi Party to establish itself as an important political power . After the Machtergreifung on 30 January 1933 , the Nazi Gauleiter Wilhelm Kube held the office of the Oberpr\u00e4sident , succeeded by Emil St\u00fcrtz in 1936 . Due to its location in the vicinity of the German capital , Brandenburg was a centre of the Nazi terror regime , with concentration camps like Sachsenhausen and Ravensbr\u00fcck and Nazi residences like Karinhall . In the late days of World War II it was the site of the bloody encounters of the Seelow Heights , at Halbe and finally the Battle of Berlin .",
      "In 1945 , after the war , the Neumark territory east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line was ceded to the Republic of Poland to form the Zielona Gora Voivodeship ( initially part of Poznan Voivodeship between 1945 and 1950 , became Lubusz Voivodeship in 1998 after merging with Gorz\u00f3w Voivodeship ) . The remaining territory became part of the Soviet occupation zone and was transformed into the state of Brandenburg , with Potsdam becoming state capital . In 1949 , the state of Brandenburg became part of East Germany and , along with the other states of Eastern Germany , in 1952 was dissolved and divided into administrative districts . Brandenburgs territory roughly corresponded with the districts of Potsdam , Frankfurt/Oder and Cottbus . In 1990 , following German reunification , Brandenburg was re-established as a state of the Federal Republic of Germany .",
      "Administration .",
      "The Prussian central government appointed for every province an Oberpr\u00e4sident ( Upper President ) carrying out central prerogatives on the provincial level and supervising the implementation of central policy on the lower levels of administration .",
      "Since 1875 , with the strengthening of self-rule within the provinces , the urban and rural districts ( Kreise ) elected representatives for the provincial Landtage diets . These parliaments legislated within the competences transferred to the provinces . The provincial diet of Brandenburg elected a provincial executive body ( government ) , the provincial committee ( Provinzialausschuss ) , and a head of province , the Landesdirektor ( Land Director ) .",

He hosted 26 episodes of Garage Mahal on the DIY Network from 2009 to 2011 .",
      "Early life .",
      "Goldberg was born and raised in Tulsa , Oklahoma , where he had a bar mitzvah at Temple Israel and graduated from Tulsa Edison High School .

His Romanian-born great-grandfather , Marcel , emigrated from Bucharest and came to the U.S . through Ellis Island . Another great-grandfather , Willie , was an immigrant from Russia .",
      "Football career .",
      "Goldberg earned a scholarship to play for the University of Georgia Bulldogs football team where he served as a defensive tackle . He was taken by the Los Angeles Rams in the 11th round , with the 301st overall selection , in the 1990 NFL draft .",

He was the first player to have been cut by the Panthers .",
      "Goldbergs NFL career ended when he tore his lower abdomen off his pelvis . He had hopes of returning to the league after rehabilitation but , due to his lack of success , was not considered a major asset . Goldberg has described playing in the NFL as a mixed emotional experience because , despite reaching the goal of simply playing in the NFL , he did not obtain the level of achievement that he desired .",

      "During the rehab following his NFL injury , Goldberg began powerlifting and mixed martial arts training . He was spotted by Lex Luger and Sting who urged him to try professional wrestling . Although not a fan of professional wrestling , he saw it as an alternative to his fledgling football career and began training at the WCW Power Plant .",
      "Working as Bill Gold , Goldberg made five appearances . The first was on a dark match at a Monday Nitro event on June 23 , 1997 where he defeated Buddy Lee Parker . He also faced and defeated Buddy Landell ( Saturday Night dark match ) , Hugh Morrus ( house show ) , Chip Minton ( Nitro dark match ) and John Betcha ( house show ) . His final pre-televised appearance was in a dark match on July 24 at a Saturday Night taping in a loss to Chad Fortune .",

      "On the September 22 , 1997 episode of Nitro , Goldberg defeated Hugh Morrus in his debut match . Soon afterward , he began to score quick victories over his fellow WCW wrestlers in the range of 1\u20132 minutes . Goldbergs succession of wins saw him quickly advance up the card , and he was pushed as a singles wrestler . The newcomer captivated fans with his monstrous yet silent charisma , brute strength , and agility that saw him vault the ropes , perform high kicks and even the occasional backflip . Goldberg made his pay-per-view debut at Starrcade defeating Steve McMichael . In early 1998 , Goldberg squashed Brad Armstrong at SuperBrawl VIII and pinned Perry Saturn at Spring Stampede . By mid-March , WCW stopped referring to him by his full name , shortening it to simply Goldberg . Around this time , WCW began counting Goldbergs consecutive wins on television as he continued to climb up the ranks . Goldbergs win over Saturn was his 74th consecutive without a loss , and the next night on Nitro he challenged Raven for the United States Heavyweight Championship that Raven had won the night before at Spring Stampede . Despite interference from Ravens Flock , Goldberg overpowered them all and defeated Raven to win his first professional wrestling championship . Two days later on the April 22 episode of Thunder , he made his first successful title defense against Mike Enos . Goldberg then started a feud with Raven and The Flock . At Slamboree , he ended his feud with The Flock after a successful title defense against Saturn . Goldberg continued to make successful title defenses against Konnan at The Great American Bash and Curt Hennig . By this time , he had adopted the catchphrase Whos next ? in reference to his rapidly expanding winning streak .",
      "As Goldberg was getting over as a main eventer , he continued to defend the United States Heavyweight Championship and was slowly becoming a contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship that was held by New World Order ( nWo ) leader Hollywood Hogan . Hogan eventually promised Goldberg a title match . The match was scheduled for the July 6 , 1998 episode of Nitro held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta with over 40,000 in attendance , but Hogan insisted that Goldberg first had to defeat his nWo stablemate Scott Hall . Goldberg won and later in the evening was also able to defeat Hogan to become the WCW World Heavyweight Champion , in turn vacating his United States Heavyweight Championship . At Road Wild , Goldberg won a battle royal , consisting of nWo members . After Diamond Dallas Page became the number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship , Goldberg and Page began a feud with each other . At Halloween Havoc , the feud was settled after Goldberg defeated Page to retain the title . According to Goldberg , his match against Page was the favorite match of his career . At Starrcade , Goldbergs undefeated streak ended at an official count of 173\u20130 , and after 174 days as champion when he lost the title to Kevin Nash after Scott Hall , disguised as a ringside security guard , made a run-in and shocked Goldberg with a taser gun . Goldberg , however , got his revenge at Souled Out , when he defeated Hall in a ladder taser match . Goldberg won when he used the taser , which was hung high above the ring , requiring the ladder to obtain it .",
      "Goldbergs win\u2013loss record at WCW events from 1997 to 1998 differed from that which was perpetuated by the company , with the official figure exaggerating the number of matches in which he won to 173 . Nick Schwartz of Fox Sports wrote : No one really knows what Goldbergs actual record was.. . but its generally accepted that 173\u20130 is an inflated number . Some of Goldbergs industry peers have stated that the figure was exaggerated . His then-WCW colleague Chris Jericho stated : One week hed be 42\u20130 and seven days later hed be 58\u20130 . Did stepping on bugs count ? Manager Jimmy Hart , who also worked with Goldberg in WCW , regarded the level of embellishment as kind of funny , while professional wrestler The Miz said : The number would just go on and on and on , to where it was like , Wait a second . How did he get this many wins in such a short time ? This exaggeration damaged the streaks credibility among the WCW audience : upon noticing that the figure had been falsified , fans began to withdraw homemade signs trumpeting Goldbergs record .",
      "Championship pursuits and final feuds ( 1999\u20132002 ) .",
      "At Spring Stampede , Goldberg gained his revenge against Nash by defeating him . Then at Slamboree the following month , Goldberg was injured in an attack by Rick and Scott Steiner and took some time off to prepare for his movie debut in the 1999 film alongside Timecop film star Jean-Claude Van Damme . He returned two months later and defeated Rick Steiner at Road Wild . Goldberg then restarted his feud with DDP also involving Pages allies , The Jersey Triad , which culminated in a match at Fall Brawl that Goldberg won . After Goldberg settled his rivalry",
      "with Page , he began focusing on Sid Vicious and challenged him to a match to end Sids winning streak . The two feuded with each other , which culminated in a match at Halloween Havoc for Sids United States Heavyweight title . Goldberg defeated Sid via referee stoppage , and thus won his second United States Heavyweight Championship . Later that night , he answered an open challenge from WCW World Heavyweight Champion Sting and defeated him to win the championship . On the next nights episode of Nitro , commissioner J.J . Dillon ruled that the match had not been sanctioned by WCW and that , therefore , Goldbergs victory was void . Sting , however , was not given the title back due to his attack on a referee during the event and Dillon announced a 32-man tournament for the now-vacant title which included Goldberg .",
      "Goldberg wrestled Bret Hart on the same Nitro in the first round of the tournament in a match that also served as the first defense of his newly won United States Heavyweight Championship . Sid Vicious managed to interfere in the contest and cost Goldberg the match , thus giving him his second career loss , costing him the title , and eliminating him from the tournament which was eventually won by Hart at Mayhem in November . Goldberg continued his rivalry with Vicious and defeated him in an I quit match at Mayhem to close their feud . Shortly thereafter , Goldberg joined forces with Hart , teaming with him to defeat Creative Control for the WCW World Tag Team Championship . One week later , they lost the title to The Outsiders ( Scott Hall and Kevin Nash ) .",
      "At Starrcade , Goldberg challenged Hart for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship ; in the course of the match , Goldberg delivered a stiff kick to Harts head , legitimately giving him a concussion and tearing a muscle in his neck . Hart continued on , suffering what he believed to be at least one other concussion when he hit his head on the floor while executing a ringpost-assisted figure-four leglock . The match ended when Roddy Piper , the special guest referee for the contest , declared Hart the winner despite Goldberg never having submitted to the Sharpshooter . Hart vacated the title the next night on Nitro , saying he did not want to win that way , and gave Goldberg a rematch . Goldberg was defeated again due to outside interference from Hall and Nash , who came to the ring brandishing baseball bats which they used to attack Goldberg . In a swerve , Hart took one of the bats from The Outsiders and began beating on Goldberg himself , doing enough damage to score the pin and regain his championship . After the match , Hall , Nash , Hart and Jeff Jarrett reformed the nWo and gave Goldberg a new target for a feud that , however , would not last long .",
      "Shortly after his title match loss , Goldberg injured himself on the December 23 , 1999 episode of Thunder , during a sequence where he chased the nWo limousine into the parking lot . A spot in the sequence called for Goldberg to pound on the windshield of the limousine with his hands . To ensure his safety , Goldberg had assistance from a piece of metal pipe and his hands were covered in black tape . After this , Goldberg was to break some of the vehicles windows with the pipe . There were four windows on the side of the limousine and Goldberg used the pipe on two of them . He then got aggressive , dropping the pipe and putting his forearm through the third window . A shard of glass sliced an artery in his arm and he began bleeding profusely . The show concluded with Goldberg pounding on the limousines hood , with the television audience able to see the massive amount of blood gushing from his arm as it covered the hood . Immediately after the cameras stopped rolling , medical personnel rushed in to assist the injured Goldberg , who was eventually transported to the hospital for emergency surgery . He lost copious amounts of blood due to the injury and was told that his injury nearly resulted in the amputation of his forearm . The injury caused Goldberg to miss the January 4 , 2000 New Japan Pro-Wrestling ( NJPW ) Tokyo Dome show , where he was scheduled to face Manabu Nakanishi . After taking time off to recuperate , Goldberg returned to WCW on the May 29 , 2000 episode of Nitro interfering in a handicap match between Kevin Nash and the team of Tank Abbott and Rick Steiner . At The Great American Bash , Goldberg betrayed Nash during Nashs world championship match against Jeff Jarrett and turned into a villain for the first time in his career , aligning himself with The New Blood faction . This did not last long , as Goldberg again was lost to injury and had to miss time . As a result of this betrayal , Goldberg feuded with Nash and defeated him at Bash at the Beach , with help from fellow New Blood member Scott Steiner . Goldberg participated in a triangle number one contenders match against Nash and Steiner at New Blood Rising , which Nash won . Goldberg walked out of the match midway through while Nash had him ready for the Jackknife Powerbomb and swore at Vince Russo as he left the ring , turning face again . He then began a rivalry with Steiner , culminating in a no disqualification match at Fall Brawl which Goldberg lost due to outside interference .",
      "After his loss to Steiner , Goldbergs rivalry with Russo accelerated and in October , having finally had enough , Russo gave Goldberg an ultimatum . If Goldberg was to lose another match at any point in time , unless he managed to duplicate his undefeated streak from 1997 to 1998 , he would be forced to retire from professional wrestling . Goldberg defeated KroniK ( Brian Adams and Bryan Clark ) at Halloween Havoc in a handicap elimination match . He then started a feud with Lex Luger . This culminated in a match at Mayhem , which Goldberg won . They continued their rivalry and battled in a rematch at Starrcade . Goldberg won the match , but afterwards he was attacked by Lugers partner Buff Bagwell . Goldberg feuded with both Luger and Bagwell , who called themselves Totally Buffed . His streak was broken at Sin when Goldberg , teaming with his Power Plant trainer DeWayne Bruce , lost to Totally Buffed in a tag team no disqualification match after a fan maced him , enabling Totally Buffed to pin him . The storyline was intended to enable Goldberg to have shoulder surgery , but WCW was sold to the WWF in March 2001 , while Goldberg was still recuperating . The WWF did not buy out Goldbergs contract with AOL Time Warner ( the parent company of WCW ) as they had done with several other WCW wrestlers , due to Goldberg still being paid out a significant amount of money by AOL Time Warner that he was owed , so he was not involved in the WWF Invasion angle . Goldberg instead remained under contract to AOL Time Warner until May 2002 , when he agreed on a contract buyout . He was WCWs highest paid athlete , alongside Bret Hart , earning $2.5 million per year , a sum which would have risen to $3.5 million in the final year of his contract , due to have expired in July 2003 .",

      "Goldberg had suffered an arm injury during the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race at the Long Beach Grand Prix in April 2002 . In August 2002 , he returned to the ring in Japan . He initially joined All Japan Pro Wrestling ( AJPW ) , defeating Satoshi Kojima and Taiy\u014d Kea . He went on to defeat Rick Steiner in a match for the W-1 promotion , and teamed with Keiji Mutoh to defeat KroniK . His success in Japan led to the WWF \u2013 now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment \u2013 to begin contract negotiations with him .",

      "After leaving Japan , Goldberg signed a one-year contract with World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) in March 2003 , debuting on the March 31 episode of Raw ( the night after WrestleMania XIX ) and starting a feud with The Rock by performing a spear on him . Their rivalry intensified when The Rock held a segment entitled The Rock Concert , where he taunted Goldberg along with Gillberg , but Goldberg defeated The Rock in his debut match at Backlash on April 27 , following three spears and a Jackhammer . Goldberg went undefeated over the subsequent half-year , defeating 3-Minute Warning in his first match on Raw on May 5 . Goldberg defeated Christian the following week on Raw in a steel cage match . Goldberg next began a feud with Chris Jericho , culminating in a match between the two at Bad Blood on June 15 , which Goldberg won .",
      "Goldberg entered a rivalry with Triple H , challenging him for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam on August 24 in the second Elimination Chamber match in WWE . After eliminating Randy Orton , Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho , he was pinned by Triple H after Ric Flair threw a sledgehammer inside the chamber and Triple H hit Goldberg with it , meaning Triple H retained the title . Goldberg continued his feud with Triple H and defeated him for the World Heavyweight Championship at Unforgiven on September 21 , after agreeing to put his career on the line . The next night on Raw , Goldberg successfully retained the title against Chris Jericho . The following week on Raw , Triple H issued a $100,000 bounty to anybody who could take Goldberg out . Steven Richards , Mark Henry , La R\u00e9sistance and Tommy Dreamer all attempted to collect the bounty , but they were unsuccessful . On the October 20 episode of Raw , Batista collected the bounty after he interfered in Goldbergs title defense against Shawn Michaels and attacked Goldberg , placing a folding chair around Goldbergs ankle and jumping off the middle rope onto the chair , shattering his ankle . Furious , Goldberg demanded a match against Batista , but Triple H got involved in the match by trying to cripple Goldberg , who executed a spear on Triple H and attacked Batista with a sledgehammer . At Survivor Series on November 16 , Goldberg retained the title against Triple H despite interference from Evolution . On the November 17 episode of Raw , Goldberg faced Triple H , Randy Orton and Batista in a handicap match , but he was pinned following an RKO , Batista Bomb and Pedigree . After the match , Kane unexpectedly came out to seemingly assist Goldberg after Evolution continued their assault on him following the match . After scaring off Evolution , he turned on Goldberg and executed a chokeslam on him . The following week on Raw , Kane attacked Goldberg again while he was defending the championship against Triple H in a rematch from Survivor Series and expressed his desire to face Goldberg for the title . Raw general manager Eric Bischoff scheduled Goldberg to defend the championship against both Kane and Triple H in a triple threat match at Armageddon . The following week on Raw , Goldberg teamed with Shawn Michaels and Rob Van Dam to face and defeat Kane , Batista and Orton in a six-man tag team match . On the December 8 episode of Raw , Goldberg faced Kane in a lumberjack match which ended in a disqualification when Evolution and Mark Henry entered the ring and assaulted Goldberg . At Armageddon on December 14 , Goldberg lost the World Heavyweight Championship when Triple H pinned him after interference from Evolution and a chokeslam from Kane , thus ending his reign at 84 days .",
      "Survivor Series also marked the first time Goldberg met the WWE Champion Brock Lesnar by interrupting Lesnar after the latter remarked that he could beat anyone in the world . The feud escalated at the 2004 Royal Rumble on January 25 , when Goldberg was in the midst of dominating the Royal Rumble match ( he eliminated Charlie Haas , Billy Gunn and Nunzio ) as the 30th entrant until Lesnar interfered in the match and executed an F-5 on Goldberg . Angrily distracted at Lesnars attack , Goldberg was eliminated by Kurt Angle . Vowing revenge after defeating Mark Henry and Jonathan Coachman in a no disqualification handicap match the following Raw , Goldberg declared Lesnar his next victim . On the February 2 episode of Raw , Goldberg was given a front row ticket to No Way Out by Stone Cold Steve Austin . SmackDown ! general manager Paul Heyman appeared the following week on Raw , and along with Mr . McMahon attempted to get Goldberg to leave Lesnar alone , but Goldberg executed a spear on Heyman and accidentally executed a spear on Austin when he was aiming for McMahon . Goldberg attended No Way Out as a fan , confronting Lesnar and after several insults by Lesnar , entered the ring and countered an F-5 from Lesnar with a Jackhammer , before being detained and escorted out of the arena by security guards . During the main event between Lesnar and Eddie Guerrero on February 15 , Goldberg reemerged from the crowd and cost Lesnar the WWE Championship . Lesnar then demanded a match with Goldberg at WrestleMania XX on March 14 , with Austin serving as special guest referee . Fans knew this would be the final WWE match for both Goldberg and Lesnar , and thus gave largely negative reactions throughout the performance . Goldberg won the match , causing Lesnar to show Austin and the crowd a middle finger , but he instead received a Stone Cold Stunner in return , and as Goldberg celebrated his victory with Austin , he also received a Stone Cold Stunner .",

Goldberg would also appear at the WWE 2K SummerSlam event the weekend before the pay-per-view event took place , fueling speculation he would be appearing at the event to confront Lesnar . This led to Paul Heyman challenging Goldberg to face Lesnar on the October 10 episode of Raw , with Heyman stating that Goldberg was the one blemish on Lesnars WWE career , as Goldberg had defeated Lesnar at WrestleMania XX in 2004 . The following week on Raw , Goldberg returned to WWE for the first time in twelve years , accepting Heymans challenge . The match took place at Survivor Series , where Goldberg defeated Lesnar in 1 minute and 26 seconds .

Spectators at WWE events had been chanting Goldberg during Rybacks matches from 2012 , which Ryback said never bothered [ him ] . In response to podcast host and mixed martial artist Chael Sonnens confusion about Rybacks appeal in late 2014 , former WWE writer Jon Piermarini noted that the creative staff were doing essentially the exact same thing they did with the character when it did not work or catch on the first time and would only continue to get Goldbergs character over as Ryback .

      "Ole Peter Arnulf \u00d8verland ( 27 April 1889 \u2013 25 March 1968 ) was a Norwegian poet and artist . He is principally known for his poetry which served to inspire the Norwegian resistance movement during the German occupation of Norway during World War II .",
      "Biography .",
      "\u00d8verland was born in Kristiansund and raised in Bergen . His parents were Peter Anton \u00d8verland ( 1852\u20131906 ) and Hanna Hage ( 1854\u20131939 ) .",
      "The early death of his father , left the family economically stressed . He was able to attend Bergen Cathedral School and in 1904 Kristiania Cathedral School . He graduated in 1907 and for a time studied philology at University of Kristiania .",
      "\u00d8verland published his first collection of poems ( 1911 ) . \u00d8verland became a communist sympathizer from the early 1920s and became a member of Mot Dag . He also served as chairman of the Norwegian Students Society 1923\u201328 . He changed his stand in 1937 , partly as an expression of dissent against the ongoing Moscow Trials . He was an avid opponent of Nazism and in 1936 he wrote the poem Du m\u00e5 ikke sove which was printed in the journal Samtiden . It ends with . ( I thought: : Something is imminent . Our era is over \u2013 Europe\u2019s on fire! ) . Probably the most famous line of the poem is ( You mustnt endure so well the injustice that doesnt affect you yourself! )",
      "During the German occupation of Norway from 1940 in World War II , he wrote to inspire the Norwegian resistance movement . He wrote a series of poems which were clandestinely distributed , leading to the arrest of both him and his future wife Margrete Aamot \u00d8verland in 1941 . Arnulf \u00d8verland was held first in the prison camp of Grini before being transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany . He spent a four-year imprisonment until the liberation of Norway in 1945 . His poems were later collected in Vi overlever alt and published in 1945 .",
      "\u00d8verland played an important role in the Norwegian language struggle in the post-war era . He became a noted supporter for the conservative written form of Norwegian called Riksm\u00e5l , he was president of Riksm\u00e5lsforbundet ( an organization in support of Riksm\u00e5l ) from 1947 to 1956 . In addition , \u00d8verland adhered to the traditionalist style of writing , criticising modernist poetry on several occasions . His speech Tungetale fra parnasset , published in Arbeiderbladet in 1954 , initiated the so-called Glossolalia debate .",
      "Personal life .",
      "In 1918 he had married the singer Hildur Arntzen ( 1888\u20131957 ) . Their marriage was dissolved in 1939 . In 1940 , he married Bartholine Eufemia Leganger ( 1903\u20131995 ) . They separated shortly after , and were officially divorced in 1945 . \u00d8verland was married to journalist Margrete Aamot \u00d8verland ( 1913\u20131978 ) during June 1945 .",
      "In 1946 , the Norwegian Parliament arranged for Arnulf and Margrete Aamot \u00d8verland to reside at the Grotten . He lived there until his death in 1968 and she lived there for another ten years until her death in 1978 .",

      "Vladimir Bukovsky",
      "Vladimir Konstantinovich Bukovsky ( ; ; 30 December 1942 \u2013 27 October 2019 ) was a Russian-born British human rights activist and writer . From the late 1950s to the mid-1970s , he was a prominent figure in the Soviet dissident movement , well known at home and abroad . He spent a total of twelve years in the psychiatric prison-hospitals , labour camps , and prisons of the Soviet Union .",
      "After being expelled from the Soviet Union in late 1976 , Bukovsky remained in vocal opposition to the Soviet system and the shortcomings of its successor regimes in Russia . An activist , a writer , and a neurophysiologist , he is celebrated for his part in the campaign to expose and halt the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union .",
      "A member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation , a director of the Gratitude Fund ( set up in 1998 to commemorate and support former dissidents ) , and a member of the International Council of the New York City-based Human Rights Foundation , Bukovsky was a Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute in Washington , D.C .",
      "In 2001 , Vladimir Bukovsky received the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom , awarded annually since 1993 by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation .",
      "Early life .",
      "Vladimir Bukovsky was born to Russian parents in the town of Belebey in the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ( today the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Russian Federation ) , to which his family was evacuated during World War II . After the war he and his parents returned to Moscow where his father Konstantin ( 1908\u20131976 ) was a well-known Soviet journalist . During his last year at school Vladimir was expelled for creating and editing an unauthorised magazine . To meet the requirements to apply for a university place he completed his secondary education at evening classes . Bukovsky was enrolled at Moscow State University for biology but was kicked out at age 19 , having criticised the Komsomol , i.e. , the Young Communist League .",
      "Soviet-era activism .",
      "Rallies .",
      "Mayakovsky Square .",
      "In September 1960 , Bukovsky entered Moscow University to study biology . There he and some friends decided to revive the informal Mayakovsky Square poetry readings which began after a statue to the poet was unveiled in central Moscow in 1958 . They made contact with earlier participants of the readings such as Vladimir Osipov , the editor of Boomerang ( 1960 ) , and Yuri Galanskov who issued the Phoenix ( 1961 ) , two examples of literary samizdat .",
      "It was then that the 19-year-old Bukovsky wrote his critical notes on the Communist Youth League or Komsomol . Later , this text was given the title Theses on the Collapse of the Komsomol by the KGB . Bukovsky portrayed the USSR as an illegal society facing an acute ideological crisis . The Komsomol was moribund , he asserted , having lost both moral and spiritual authority , and he called for its democratisation . This text , and his other activities , brought Bukovsky to the attention of the authorities . He was interrogated twice before being thrown out of the university in autumn 1961 .",
      "Bukovsky was arrested on 1 June 1963 . He was later convicted , in absentia , by reason of his insanity , under Article 70.1 ( Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda ) of the RSFSR Criminal Code . The official charge was the making and possession of photocopies of anti-Soviet literature , namely two copies of the banned work by Milovan Djilas . Bukovsky was examined by Soviet psychiatrists , declared to be mentally ill ( schizophrenia ) , and sent for treatment at the Special Psychiatric Hospital in Leningrad where he remained for almost two years , until February 1965 . It was there he became acquainted with General Petro Grigorenko , a fellow inmate .",
      "The Glasnost rally , 5 December 1965 .",
      "In December 1965 , Bukovsky helped prepare a demonstration on Pushkin Square in central Moscow to protest against the trial of the writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel . He circulated the Civic Appeal by mathematician and poet Alexander Esenin-Volpin , which called on the authorities to obey the Soviet laws requiring glasnost in the judicial process , e.g . the admission of the public and the media to any trial . The demonstration on 5 December 1965 ( Constitution Day ) became known as the Glasnost Meeting or rally , and marked the beginning of the openly active Soviet civil rights movement .",
      "Bukovsky himself was unable to attend . Three days earlier he was arrested , charged with distributing the appeal , and kept in various psikhushkas , among them Hospital No 13 at Lublino , Stolbovaya and the Serbsky Institute , until July 1966 .",
      "The Right to Demonstrate , 1967 .",
      "On 22 January 1967 , Bukovsky , Vadim Delaunay , Yevgeny Kushev and Victor Khaustov held another demonstration on Pushkin Square . They were protesting against the recent arrests of Alexander Ginzburg , Yuri Galanskov , Alexei Dobrovolsky and Vera Lashkova ( finally prosecuted in January 1968 in the Trial of the Four ) and asserting their own right to protest : on 16 September 1966 a new law , Article 190.3 , had been introduced which classified any public gatherings or demonstrations as a crime .",
      "On 1 September 1967 , at his own trial , Bukovsky used his final words to attack the regimes failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures . He invoked Article 125 of the ( still current ) 1936 Soviet Constitution to defend the right to organise demonstrations and other public protests . He further suggested that the prosecution had repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure in its conduct of the case . Bukovskys final words in court circulated widely in a samizdat collection of such addresses and as part of a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov .",
      "Fellow protestors Vadim Delaunay and Yevgeny Kushev admitted regret for their actions but not their guilt ; they received suspended sentences and were released . Bukovsky was defiant and , like fellow demonstrator Victor Khaustov ( convicted in February 1967 ) , was given three years in an ordinary regime corrective-labour camp . Bukovsky was sent to Bor in the Voronezh Region to serve his sentence . He was released in January 1970 .",
      "The Campaign against the Abuse of Psychiatry .",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s , the Soviet authorities began the widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded . This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka , as such places were popularly known , which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up ( e.g . the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital ) as part of an existing penal institution . Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients ; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs ; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB .",
      "In 1971 , Bukovsky managed to smuggle to the West over 150 pages documenting the political abuse of psychiatric institutions in the Soviet Union . In a letter addressed to Western psychiatrists and written in a deliberately restrained tone , Bukovsky asked them to consider if the evidence justified the isolation of several dissidents , and urged them to discuss the matter at the next International Congress of Psychiatrists .",
      "The documents were released to the press in March 1971 by a small French group called the International Committee for the Defence of Human Rights . Bukovskys letter appeared on 12 March in The Times ( London ) and later in the British Journal of Psychiatry Bukovsky was arrested on 29 March and held in custody for nine months before being put on trial in January 1972 .",
      "The information Bukovsky had gathered and sent to the West galvanised human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union . It also struck a chord among psychiatrists . In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times ( London ) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned . At a meeting in November 1971 , the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened . These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events , which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovskys friends and fellow rights activists in his defence . As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row , Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation , without access to a lawyer , to be tried and sent to the camps or a special psychiatric hospital .",
      "Responding to public pressure , the World Psychiatric Association finally condemned Soviet practices at its Sixth World Congress in 1977 and set up a review committee to monitor misuse . In 1983 , the Soviet representatives withdrew from the World Psychiatric Association rather than face expulsion . Bukovsky later characterised this reaction as the most important victory for the dissident form of glasnost .",
      "Final arrest ( 1971 ) and imprisonment .",
      "Following the release of the documents , Bukovsky was denounced in Pravda as a malicious hooligan , engaged in anti-Soviet activities and arrested on 29 March 1971 . At first held in Lefortovo Prison , in August , Bukovsky spent approximately three months in the Serbsky Institute , which this time pronounced him mentally sound and able to stand trial .",
      "During the trial in January 1972 Bukovsky was accused of slandering Soviet psychiatry , contacts with foreign journalists , and the possession and distribution of samizdat . On this occasion he again used his final words to the court to reach a much wider audience when the text circulated in samizdat . He was sentenced to two years in prison , five in a labour camp , and five more in internal exile .",
      "While in prison Bukovsky and his fellow inmate , the psychiatrist Semyon Gluzman , wrote a brief 20-page Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents , which was widely published abroad , in Russian ( 1975 ) and in many other languages : English , French , Italian , German , Danish . It instructed potential victims of political psychiatry how to behave during interrogation to avoid being diagnosed as mentally ill .",
      "Deportation from the USSR ( 1976 ) .",
      "The fate of Bukovsky and other political prisoners in the Soviet Union had been repeatedly brought to world attention by Western diplomats and human rights groups such as the relatively new Amnesty International .",
      "In December 1976 , Bukovsky was deported from the USSR and exchanged at Z\u00fcrich airport by the Soviet government for the imprisoned general secretary of the Communist Party of Chile , Luis Corval\u00e1n . In his 1978 autobiography Bukovsky describes how he was brought to Switzerland in handcuffs . The widely publicised exchange increased public awareness in the West about Soviet dissidents . A fellow dissident , Vadim Delaunay wrote an epigram on the occasion :",
      "<poem>",
      "They exchanged a hooligan",
      "For one Luis Corvalan .",
      "Now we need to find a bitch",
      "To exchange her for Ilyich",
      "</poem>",
      "In March 1977 , US President Jimmy Carter met with Bukovsky at the White House . In the USSR the meeting was seen by dissidents and rights activists as a sign of the newly elected presidents willingness to stress human rights in his foreign policy ; the event provoked harsh criticism by Soviet leaders .",
      "Bukovsky moved to Great Britain where he settled in Cambridge and resumed his studies in biology , disrupted fifteen years earlier ( see above ) by his expulsion from Moscow University .",
      "Life in the West .",
      "Bukovsky gained a masters degree in Biology at Cambridge University . He also wrote and published To Build a Castle : My Life as a Dissenter ( 1978 ) . ( The title in Russian , And the Wind Returns ... , is a Biblical allusion. ) The book was translated into English , French and German . It was published in Russian the following year by Chalidze publishers in New York . Today the Russian original is available online via a number of websites .",
      "Since he has lived in the West , Bukovsky has written many essays and polemical articles . These not only criticised the Soviet regime and , later , that of Vladimir Putin , but also exposed Western gullibility in the face of Soviet abuses and , in some cases , what he believed to be Western complicity in such crimes . In the late 1970s and early 1980s , following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , Bukovsky campaigned successfully for an official UK and US boycott of the summer 1980 Olympics in Moscow . During the same years he voiced concern about the activities and policies of the Western peace movements .",
      "In 1983 , together with Cuban dissident Armando Valladares , Bukovsky co-founded and was later elected president of Resistance International . The anti-Communist organisation was run from a small office in Paris by Soviet dissidents and emigres , notably Vladimir Maximov and Eduard Kuznetsov . In 1985 it expanded into the American Foundation for Resistance International . Among the prominent members of the board were Albert Jolis and Jeane Kirkpatrick while Midge Decter , Yuri Yarim-Agaev , Richard Perle , Saul Bellow , Robert Conquest and Martin Colman were on the bodys advisory committee . The Foundation aimed to be a co-ordinating centre for dissident and democratic movements seeking to overturn communism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere . It organised protests in the communist countries and in the West , and opposed western financial assistance to communist governments . The Foundation also created the National Council to Support Democratic Movements ( National Council for Democracy ) with the goal of aiding the emergence of democratic rule-of-law governments , and providing assistance with the writing of constitutions and the formation of civil institutions .",
      "In March 1987 , Bukovsky and nine other \u00e9migr\u00e9 authors ( Ernst Neizvestny , Yury Lyubimov , Vasily Aksyonov and Leonid Plyushch among them ) caused a furore in the West and then in the Soviet Union itself when they raised doubts about the substance and sincerity of Mikhail Gorbachevs reforms .",
      "Return to the Soviet Union ( 1991 ) .",
      "In April 1991 , Vladimir Bukovsky visited Moscow for the first time since his deportation fifteen years before .",
      "In the run-up to the 1991 presidential election , Boris Yeltsins campaign team included Bukovsky on their list of potential vice-presidential running-mates . In the end , army officer Alexander Rutskoy , a veteran of the 1979\u20131989 war in Afghanistan and Hero of the Soviet Union was selected . On 5 December 1991 , both of Bukovskys Soviet-era convictions were annulled by a decree of the RSFSR Supreme Court . The following year President Yeltsin formally restored Bukovskys Russian citizenship : he had never been deprived of his Soviet citizenship , despite deportation from the country .",
      "Post-Soviet Union activities .",
      "British and European psychiatrists assessing the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterised him in 1971 : The information we have about [ Vladimir Bukovsky ] suggests that he is the sort of person who might be embarrassing to authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort , and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him . But such people often have much to contribute , and deserve considerable respect .",
      "Soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union Vladimir Bukovsky was again out of favour with the Russian authorities . He supported Yeltsin against the Supreme Soviet in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis in October that year but criticised the new Constitution of Russia approved two months later , as being designed to ensure a continuation of Yeltsins power . According to Bukovsky , Yeltsin became a hostage of the security agencies from 1994 onwards , and a restoration of KGB rule was inevitable .",
      "Judgment in Moscow ( 1995\u20132019 ) .",
      "In 1992 , after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , President Yeltsins government invited Bukovsky to serve as an expert witness at the trial before the Constitutional Court where Russias communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their Party and taking its property . The respondents case was that the CPSU itself had been an unconstitutional organisation . To prepare his testimony , Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from the CPSU Central Committee archives ( then reorganised into the Central Depository for Contemporary Documentation or TsKhSD ) . With the help of a small hand-held scanner and a laptop computer , he managed secretly to make photocopies of many of the documents ( some with high security clearance ) , including KGB reports to the Central Committee . The copies were then smuggled to the West .",
      "Bukovsky hoped that an international tribunal in Moscow might play a similar role to the first Nuremberg Trial ( 1945\u20131946 ) in post-Nazi Germany and help the country begin to overcome the legacy of Communism .",
      "It took several years and a team of assistants to piece together the scanned fragments ( many only half a page in width ) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then , in 1999 , to make them available online . Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovskys Judgment in Moscow ( 1995 ) , where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West .",
      "The book was soon translated into several languages but did not appear in English for over twenty years . Random House bought the rights to the manuscript , but the publisher , in Bukovskys words , tried to make the author rewrite the whole book from the liberal left political perspective . Bukovsky resisted , explaining to the Random House editor that he was allergic to political censorship because of certain peculiarities of my biography . ( The contract was subsequently cancelled. ) .",
      "Meanwhile , the book was published in French as Judgement \u00e0 Moscou ( 1995 ) , in Russian ( 1996 ) and in certain other Slavic languages : for a time the Polish edition became a best-seller . In 2016 , it was published in Italian , by Spirali , with the title Gli archivi segreti di Mosca . An English language translation did not appear until May 2019 , five months before the author died .",
      "Potential 1992 mayoral candidacy .",
      "In 1992 , a group of liberal deputies of the Moscow City Council proposed Bukovskys candidacy for elections of the new Mayor of Moscow , following the resignation of the previous Mayor , Gavriil Popov . Bukovsky refused the offer , stating that to fulfil the mayors duties he would need a large team of intellectuals committed to radical reform , and there was a lack of such people in the country . Deputy mayor Yury Luzhkov took over , and ran the city from 1992 to 2010 .",
      "Potential 1996 presidential candidacy .",
      "In early 1996 , a group of Moscow academics , journalists and intellectuals suggested that Vladimir Bukovsky should run for President of Russia as an alternative candidate to both incumbent President Boris Yeltsin and his main challenger Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation . However , no formal nomination process was initiated .",
      "Memento Gulag .",
      "In 2001 , Bukovsky was elected President of the Comitatus pro Libertatibus \u2013 Comitati per le Libert\u00e0 \u2013 Freedom Committees in Florence , an Italian libertarian organisation which promoted an annual Memento Gulag , or Memorial Day devoted to the Victims of Communism , on 7 November ( the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution ) . The Memento Gulag has since been held in Rome , Bucharest , Berlin , La Roche sur Yon and Paris .",
      "Contacts with Boris Nemtsov and the Russian Opposition .",
      "In 2002 , Boris Nemtsov , former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia who was then an elected member of the State Duma and leader of the Union of Rightist Forces , paid a visit to Bukovsky in Cambridge . He wanted to discuss the strategy of the Russian opposition . It was imperative , Bukovsky told Nemtsov , that Russian liberals adopt an uncompromising stand toward what he saw as the authoritarian government of President Vladimir Putin .",
      "On one of journalist Anna Politkovskayas frequent visits to Britain she interviewed Vladimir Bukovsky and Boris Berezovsky to provide a comparative analysis of different waves of political emigration . With Bukovsky , The Patriarch as he was called in the published version of her article , she discussed the position of those who had gained political asylum in Britain ( Ahmed Zakayev , Alexander Litvinenko ) , and the attitudes of the UK government of Tony Blair and of the European Parliament to the situation in Chechnya . During their talk Bukovsky expressed disapproval of the way in which Slobodan Milosevic was brought before the Hague tribunal .",
      "In January 2004 , with Garry Kasparov , Boris Nemtsov , Vladimir V . Kara-Murza and others , Bukovsky was a co-founder of Committee 2008 . This umbrella organisation of the Russian democratic opposition was formed to ensure free and fair elections in 2008 when a successor to Vladimir Putin was elected .",
      "In 2005 , Bukovsky was among the prominent dissidents of the 1960s and 1970s ( Gorbanevskaya , Sergei Kovalyov , Eduard Kuznetsov , Alexander Podrabinek , Yelena Bonner ) who took part in a documentary series by Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr . They Chose Freedom . In 2013 Bukovsky was featured in a documentary series by Natella Boltyanskaya Parallels , Events , People .",
      "In 2009 , Bukovsky joined the council of the new Solidarnost coalition which brought together a wide range of extra-parliamentary opposition forces .",
      "Criticism of torture in Abu Ghraib prison ( Iraq ) .",
      "As revelations mounted about the sanctioned torture of captives in the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention camp , Abu Ghraib and the CIA secret prisons , Bukovsky entered the discussion with an uncompromising attack on the official if covert rationalisation of torture . In an 18 December 2005 op-ed in The Washington Post , Bukovsky recounted his experience under torture in Lefortovo prison in 1971 . Once commenced , he warned , the inertia of torture was difficult to control , corrupting those who carried it out . Torture , he wrote , has historically been an instrument of oppression\u2014not an instrument of investigation or of intelligence gathering . Bukovsky explained :",
      "US President Barack Obama repudiated the Torture Memos on 20 January 2009 , two days after taking office .",
      "Criticism of the European Union .",
      "In EUSSR , a booklet written with Pavel Stroilov and published in 2004 , Bukovsky exposed what he saw as the Soviet roots of European Integration . Two years later , in an interview with The Brussels Journal , Bukovsky said he had read confidential documents from secret Soviet files in 1992 which confirmed the existence of a conspiracy to turn the European Union into a socialist organisation . The European Union was a monster , he argued , and it must be destroyed , the sooner the better , before it develops into a full-fledged totalitarian state .",
      "There were certain parallels , Bukovsky warned in his interview , between the formation of the Soviet Union and the European Union . In 2006 he described the perils of the USSR , with its model whereby nationalities and ethnic groups were dissolved to create a new Soviet nation . While Soviet ideology postulated that the State would eventually wither away , Bukovsky pointed out that the reality was quite different : the State had become paramount . As an expression of his Eurosceptic position Bukovsky was vice-president of The Freedom Association ( TFA ) in the United Kingdom and a patron of the United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) .",
      "In 2007 , following a similar line of argument , Bukovsky suggested that Russia was too big and should be broken up into several smaller countries .",
      "Ten years earlier , Bukovsky sketched some of the ways in which cooperation was secured . Beyond those who were recruited as Soviet agents and consciously worked for the USSR , as he explained in Judgment in Moscow ( 1995 ) , there were men and women whom the KGB and GRU classified as agents of influence and confidential contacts :",
      "This applied equally , Bukovsky cautioned , to post-Stalin generations of specialists on the USSR and Eastern Europe . They had been subjected to similar pressures and inducements in the 1970s and 1980s :",
      "2008 presidential candidacy .",
      "In May 2007 , Bukovsky announced his plans to run as candidate for president in the May 2008 Russian presidential election . On 16 December 2007 , Bukovsky was officially nominated to run against Dmitry Medvedev and other candidates.The group that nominated Bukovsky as a candidate included Yuri Ryzhov , Vladimir V . Kara-Murza , Alexander Podrabinek , Andrei Piontkovsky , Vladimir Pribylovsky and others . Activists , authors and commentators such as Viktor Shenderovich , Valeriya Novodvorskaya and Lev Rubinstein also favoured Bukovsky .",
      "Responding to pro-Kremlin politicians and commentators who expressed doubt about Bukovskys electoral prospects , his nominators rejected a number of frequently repeated allegations . In Moscow more than 800 citizens of the Russian Federation nominated Bukovsky for president on 16 December 2007 . Bukovsky secured the required number of signatures to register and submitted his application to the Central Election Commission on time , 18 December 2007 .",
      "Bukovskys candidacy received the support of Grigory Yavlinsky , who announced on 14 December 2007 at the Yabloko party conference that he would forgo a campaign of his own and would instead support Bukovsky .",
      "The Action Group in support of Bukovskys candidacy denied claims by pro-government media that Bukovsky had failed in his campaign to become RF President and in appeals before the RF Constitutional Court .",
      "On 22 December 2007 , the Central Electoral Commission turned down Bukovskys application , on the grounds that ( 1 ) he had failed to give information about his activities as a writer when submitting his documents , ( 2 ) he was holding a British residence permit , and ( 3 ) he had not been living in Russia during the past ten years . Bukovsky appealed against the decision at the RF Supreme Court on 28 December 2007 and , subsequently , before its cassation board on 15 January 2008 .",
      "On 30 March 2011 , Bukovsky requested the arrest of Mikhail Gorbachev by the British authorities after submitting to Westminster Magistrates Court materials on crimes against humanity that the former Soviet leader had allegedly committed in the late 1980s and early 1990s .",
      "Crimea , Ukraine , Litvinenko Inquiry ( 2012\u20132015 ) .",
      "Bukovsky was among the first 34 signatories of Putin must go , an online anti-Putin manifesto published on 10 March 2010 . In May 2012 , Vladimir Putin began his third term as president of the Russian Federation after serving four years as the countrys prime minister . The following year , Bukovsky published a collection of interviews in Russia which described Putin and his team as The heirs of Lavrentiy Beria , Stalins last and most notorious secret police chief .",
      "In March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea after Ukraine had lost control of its government buildings , airports and military bases in Crimea to unmarked soldiers and local pro-Russian militias . The West responded with sanctions targeted at Putins immediate entourage , and Bukovsky expressed the hope that this would prove the end of his regime .",
      "In October 2014 , the Russian authorities declined to issue Bukovsky with a new foreign-travel passport . The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that it could not confirm Bukovskys citizenship . The response was met with surprise from Presidential Human Rights Council and the Human Rights ombudsman of the Russian Federation .",
      "On 17 March 2015 , at the long-delayed inquiry into Alexander Litvinenkos fatal poisoning Bukovsky gave his views as to why the former FSB man had been murdered . Interviewed on BBC TV eight years before , Bukovsky expressed no doubt that the Russian authorities were responsible for the London death of Litvinenko on 23 November 2006 .",
      "Prohibited images prosecution .",
      "In 2015 , the UK Crown Prosecution Service announced prosecution of Bukovsky for prohibited images of children allegedly found on his computer . Bukovskys statements about the accusations were inconsistent . According to the prosecutor William Carter , Bukovsky told detectives that he himself had downloaded the images over the course of 15 years . On another occasion , Bukovsky described the accusations as absurd and said that the tip about the images \u2013 which he initially said were planted on his computer by a backdoor program \u2013 was passed through Europol from Russian security services . Bukovsky also noted that while the original announcement by the CPS accused him of possession and making , the prosecution materials passed to the court only charged possession .",
      "In early May 2015 , it was reported that Bukovsky had undergone a nine-hour heart operation in a private German clinic , during which he was given two artificial valves . Subsequently , Bukovsky was kept in a medically-induced coma for three days to improve his chances of recovery . After partial recovery from his lengthy heart surgery , Vladimir Bukovsky responded to charges brought against him by the UK Crown Prosecution Service earlier in the year . Issuing a High Court writ for libel , Vladimir Bukovsky said that the CPS had defamed him , and claimed damages of \u00a3100,000 . Bukovsky was later ruled to be too ill to stand trial .",
      "Death .",
      "Bukovsky died of a heart attack on 27 October 2019 at the age of 76 in Cambridge , Cambridgeshire , after a period of ill-health .",

      "Description .",
      "The line is mostly double-track , except for 1.1 km of single track between Wakita Junction and Hon-Kawagoe Station . While the section from Seibu-Shinjuku to Takadanobaba is elevated , the line runs at ground level through a suburban area until Saginomiya .",

      "History .",
      "The oldest section of the Shinjuku Line is between Higashi-Murayama Station and Hon-Kawagoe Station . This section was built by the to serve as a freight feeder for the between Shinjuku and Tachikawa ( now known as the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line ) . The initial Kawagoe Railway route opened between Kokubunji and Kumegawa in 1894 ; this portion is now known as the Seibu Kokubunji Line . Its northward extension to Kawagoe , the first part of what is now the Seibu Shinjuku Line , opened in 1895 . Following several mergers and name changes between 1920 and 1922 , the Kawagoe Railway became part of the Seibu Railway .",
      "In 1927 , Seibu Railway built its new dual track , electrified at 1,500 V DC , Murayama Line between Takadanobaba Station on the Yamanote Line in Tokyo and Higashi-Murayama Station to compete with ( present-day Seibu Ikebukuro Line ) and the Japanese National Railways Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line , the route being in the middle of the two . The rest of the line was electrified at the same time .",
      "The Higashi-Murayama to Tokorozawa section was double-tracked between 1950 and 1958 , with the Tokorozawa to Irimagawa section double-tracked between 1967 and 1975 . The rest of the line ( except for the section between the Wakita Junction and Hon-Kawagoe Station ) was double-tracked between 1980 and 1991 .",
      "In 1952 , a dual-track extension from Takadanobaba to Seibu-Shinjuku Station was completed . At this time the line was renamed the Shinjuku Line , integrating the Murayama Line and the northern section of the Kawagoe Line . The new Seibu-Shinjuku terminal was built as a temporary station , as Seibu planned to extend the line to the second floor of what is now known as Lumine Est on the east side of Shinjuku Station . This plan was later scrapped due to insufficient space to handle trains longer than six cars . Seibu-Shinjuku Station was expanded to include a high-rise hotel in 1977 .",
      "During the 1960s , Seibu unsuccessfully negotiated with the Teito Rapid Transit Authority to offer through service between the Shinjuku Line and Tozai Line . Seibus approach was rejected in favor of through operation with the Chuo Main Line .",
      "In the 1980s , Seibu drew up a plan to build an underground line for express trains between Seibu-Shinjuku and Kami-Shakujii , including a new underground station between Seibu-Shinjuku and the Metro Promenade . This plan was indefinitely postponed in 1995 due to costs and a decline in passenger ridership versus previous projections . Seibu was also a bidder to acquire the former JR freight terminal site in 1989 , where they planned to build a new underground terminal ; Takashimaya won the bid and constructed the Takashimaya Times Square complex on the site .",
      "From the start of the revised timetable on 30 June 2012 , the limited-stop services were abolished .",
      "Station numbering was introduced on all Seibu Railway lines during fiscal 2012 , with Seibu Shinjuku Line stations numbered prefixed with the letters SS .",

He served as President of the Government of Catalonia from 17 May 2018 to 28 September 2020 , when the Supreme Court of Spain confirmed a court ruling by the High Court of Justice of Catalonia condemning him because of disobeying the Central Electoral Board during the April 2019 general election , leading to his disqualification from office .",

      "From September 2011 to 2015 , during the mayorship of Xavier Trias , Torra was in charge of promoting the district of Ciutat Vella as director of Foment de Ciutat Vella , SA . In June 2012 he became director of the Born Centre de Cultura i Mem\u00f2ria but in September 2015 , shortly after Ada Colau became mayor , he left the organisation . He was appointed director of Revista de Catalunya in May 2015 . He was director of the Generalitats Center for Contemporary Subject Studies from March 2016 to October 2017 . He is currently working as a lawyer and is a member of the Bar Association of Barcelona .",
      "Activism and politics .",
      "Torra is a member of the pro-Catalan independence \u00d2mnium Cultural ( OC ) , of which he was vice-president from 2013 to 2015 , and Assemblea Nacional Catalana ( ANC ) . He was president of the pro-independence Sobirania i Just\u00edcia from 2010 to 2011 and a member of the permanent council of the ANC in 2012 . In 2011 Torra and lawyer Jordi Cortada filed a lawsuit before the European Court of Human Rights against the Constitutional Courts re-writing of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia . When the OC president , Muriel Casals i Couturier , was chosen as a candidate for the 2015 Catalan regional election Torra was appointed as president in July 2015 , serving until December 2015 when he was replaced by Jordi Cuixart .",
      "Torra was associated with the Democratic Union of Catalonia ( UDC ) , a regionalist center-right party , and later Reagrupament , a splinter group of the left-wing pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia ( ERC ) . Torra is not a member of any political party and is known to have reservations about certain policies of the Catalan European Democratic Party ( PDeCAT ) , the main constituent of the pro-independence Together for Catalonia ( JuntsxCat ) electoral alliance . He is believed to be on good terms with the left-wing pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy ( CUP ) which is not a member of JuntsxCat .",
      "Torra contested the 2017 regional election as an independent JuntsxCat candidate in the Province of Barcelona and was elected to the Parliament of Catalonia . At the election Catalan secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan Parliament . Attempts by the secessionists to inaugurate three candidates \u2013 Carles Puigdemont , Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Turull \u2013 as President of Catalonia were thwarted by the Spanish courts . In May 2018 Torra , the so-called plan D , was nominated as candidate for president . At the investiture vote held on 12 May 2018 Torra secured 66 votes ( JuntsxCat 34 ; ERC\u2013CatS\u00ed 32 ) with 65 votes against ( Cs 36 ; PSC 17 ; CatCom\u00fa\u2013Podem 8 ; PP 4 ) and four abstentions ( CUP-CC 4 ) , failing to achieve the 68 votes necessary for an absolute majority . As a result , a second vote was held on 14 May 2018 at which he only needed a simple majority to become president . The result of the second vote was exactly the same as the first vote \u2013 66 in favour , 65 against and four abstentions \u2013 and as a result Torra was elected the 131st President of Catalonia . He was sworn in on 17 May 2018 . On May 19 he appointed his government , which included as regional ministers , Jordi Turull and Josep Rull ( in preventive custody ) as well as Toni Com\u00edn and Llu\u00eds Puig , in self-imposed exile in Belgium and also required by the Spanish justice . Since article 155 was still in force , Mariano Rajoy decided not to publish the appointments in the Generalitat government gazette , which led to a criminal complaint for prevarication brought by President Torra . In order to avoid extending the application of article 155 , on May 29 President Torra appointed a new government , which took office on June 2 , which ended a period of seven months of direct rule on Catalonia from Madrid .",
      "In December 2018 , Torra announced a 48-hour fast in solidarity with the prisoners of Lledoners who were carrying out a hunger strike , Jordi S\u00e0nchez , Jordi Turull , Joaquim Forn and Josep Rull .",
      "Controversial writings .",
      "The tone and content of some articles written by Torra in 2012 criticizing anti-Catalanism and Spain have elicited strong criticism from numerous sectors . Critics have accused Torra of being xenophobic and a supremacist . In an online editorial , he metaphorically described people who live in Catalonia but reject Catalan-nationalism and culture as beasts or scavengers , vipers , hyenas , who have a little bump in their DNA chain . In addition , several tweets from 2012 that he later removed included sentences like Spaniards only know how to plunder and Spaniards in Catalonia are like energy \u2013 they transform themselves but do not disappear .",
      "At European level , the President of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group , Hans van Baalen condemned his rhetoric as separatist and racist and the Party of European Socialists stated that his racist remarks are utterly disgusting and cast deep doubts about his fitness for the job . The Catalan chapter of French NGO SOS Racisme also criticized the tone of the articles , but stated they cannot be considered racism . Torra apologised for the tweets after being nominated to be president .",
      "Judicial case and disqualification .",
      "On 19 December 2019 Torra was sentenced by the High Court of Justice of Catalonia ( TSJC ) to a year and a half of disqualification ( inhabilitaci\u00f3n ) from holding any elected office and/or from exercising government powers , in addition to a fine of \u20ac30,000 for disobeying the Central Electoral Board ( JEC ) by not withdrawing partisan symbols in the Palau de la Generalitat and not guaranteeing the institutions neutrality during the April election campaign . Torra then vowed to appeal the sentence ( not firm ) to a higher instance , the Supreme Court ( TS ) .",
      "On 3 January 2020 the JEC determined the execution of the TSJC sentence in regards of Torras electability as member of the Parliament of Catalonia , ruling Torras inhabilitation from his parliamentary seat . The JEC left open to interpretation if losing the seat would also entail the disqualification from the post of president of the regional government . Torra appealed again to the TS to clarify the JEC ruling , on whether the electoral authority actually had the authority to strip him of the parliamentary seat . The second appeal before the TS by Torra was turned down .",
      "Enforcing the ruling of the JEC , the Secretary of the Parliament of Catalonia stripped Torra of his status as legislator on 27 January 2020 . Torra compelled then the Houses Speaker , ERCs Roger Torrent ( who had announced he would not take the vote of Torra into consideration ) to contempt unless he wanted to put the institutions at risk , to no success . The Parliament of Catalonia had interpreted the Statute of Catalonia in the sense that the President of the Generalitat could remain in the post , as the status of legislator would be necessary only at the moment of the investiture , so , for the time being and pending the resolution of his appeal before the TS , Torra remains as president of the Catalan Government . Symptoms of collapse of the JuntsxCat\u2013ERC coalition government ensued after Torras unseating , with the absence in the votings of the full JuntsxCat bloc vis-\u00e0-vis the passing of the Parliaments budget and a defiant Torra , who refrained then from calling a new election , nonetheless . A day after Torra argued that the ( legislative ) term had no political future if unity cannot be maintained and announced his intention to call a new election , but not until the regional budget was passed .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Torra is married to teacher Carola Mir\u00f3 . They have three children , two girls and a boy .",
      "On 16 March 2020 , he announced in a public appearance he was positive for COVID-19 during COVID-19 pandemic in Spain .",

      "Anmer Hall",
      "Anmer Hall is a Georgian country house in in the village of Anmer in Norfolk , England . Built in the 18th century , it was acquired by the Sandringham Estate sometime after Queen Victoria purchased the property , and has previously been leased to buisnessowners , civil servants , and members of the British royal family . It is currently the country residence of Prince William , Duke of Cambridge and Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge , given to the couple as a wedding gift by Elizabeth II .",
      "Design and location .",
      "The Georgian house was built in 1802 . It has two storeys and attic with dormer windows . The long south front comprises 13 bays , and was refaced with red bricks c . 1815 . It has 13 ground-floor windows set in blank arches and a semicircular porch on two Tuscan columns , with 11 windows on the first floor . The three central bays are topped by a pediment . The north front is of rubble carrstone and includes four c . 17th-century ogee-headed sashes on the first floor . Renovations c . 1900 added a brick dressed skin to the north front , together with a projecting entrance porch and a tower towards the eastern end , in the corner formed with a carrstone service wing also added c . 1900 . The house was registered as a Grade II* listed building in 1984 but was later de-listed .",
      "Anmer Hall has ten bedrooms . The interior style has been described to be a mixture of contemporary designs and well-loved antiques , decorated with gilt picture frames and houseplants . The walls have been reported to be painted in cream colors , while the dining room is a bold jewel green . The house contains an outdoor swimming pool and a tennis court . In 2017 , it was reported that residents Prince William , Duke of Cambridge and Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge had installed a chicken coop onto the grounds .",
      "The surrounding estate became a scheduled ancient monument in 2003 , and includes earthworks marking the sites of buildings from the medieval village of Anmer . The village church , St Mary , lies close to the house , but a short distance away from the modern village . The house is northeast of Kings Lynn , east of the Queens residence at Sandringham and west of Houghton Hall .",
      "History .",
      "The Sandringham estate was bought by Queen Victoria in 1862 as a wedding present for the Prince of Wales ; neighbouring land and properties , including Anmer Hall , were added to the estate in subsequent years .",
      "In 1896 , the Anmer Hall estate was purchased at auction for \u00a325,000 by the famed serial fraudster Ernest Terah Hooley before his first bankruptcy . The Prince had attempted to purchase the property prior to Hooleys acquisition . Through an intermediary , Prince Edward had requested to purchase the property from Hooley for the reported use of his daughter , Princess Maud . Hooley agreed , allowing him to buy it at cost in 1898 . A further motivation for the Princes action was to avoid the possibility of Hooleys business promoter Alexander Meyrick Broadley , whom the Prince had implicated in the Cleveland Street scandal , from becoming a constant guest on the estate .",
      "Anmer Hall was leased to John Loader Maffey , 1st Baron Rugby who served as Governor-General of Sudan , and held diplomatic posts in the Colonial Office and Ireland . His daughter , Penelope Aitken , socialised with the Royal Family and was reportedly a favourite of George V. .",
      "From 1972 to 1990 , Anmer Hall was leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house . It was subsequently rented for the next decade by Hugh van Cutsem , a close friend of Charles , Prince of Wales . During his residency , the house was often visited by Prince William and Prince Harry in their childhood . The house was then leased to the family of James Everett , owner of kitchen timber company Norfolk Oak .",
      "The lease to the Everett family was terminated early following the allocation for Anmer Hall for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . The country home was given as a wedding gift to the couple from Elizabeth II . A \u00a31.5 million refurbishment programme was put in place , paid for by private royal family funds . Renovations included a new roof , new kitchen , the addition of a conservatory , complete internal redecoration ; and an extensive tree-planting programme to afford the Duke and Duchess greater privacy .",
      "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children moved into Anmer Hall in 2015 , and used it as their main residence until 2017 . It continues to be their private country home , and the family have been reported to spend weekends and school holidays at Anmer . William and Catherines annual Christmas card has featured photographs of the couple outside the home alongside their children . The family isolated at the residence during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic . A montage video of the family , filmed within the grounds of Anmer Hall , was released to celebrate the Duke and Duchesss tenth wedding anniversary .",

      "Marquette Golden Eagles",
      "The Marquette Golden Eagles , formerly known as the Marquette Warriors , Blue and Gold , Gold , Hilltoppers , and Golden Avalanche ( football only ) , are the athletic teams representing Marquette University in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , United States . They compete as a member of the NCAA Division I level ( non-football sub-level ) , primarily competing in the Big East Conference for all sports since its establishment in 2013 . The Golden Eagles are a founding member of the current Big East , having been one of the seven members of the original Big East that broke away to form a basketball-focused league . They had joined the original Big East in 2005 , having previously competed in Conference USA ( C-USA ) from 1995\u201396 to 2004\u201305 , the Great Midwest Conference from 1991\u201392 to 1994\u201395 and the Horizon League from 1988\u201389 to 1990\u201391 . They also competed as an independent from 1916\u201317 to 1987\u201388 . Mens sports include basketball , cross country , golf , lacrosse , soccer , tennis and track & field , while womens sports include basketball , cross country , lacrosse , soccer , tennis , track & field and volleyball .",
      "The mens basketball team won the NCAA national championship in 1977 , and was a finalist in 1974 and a semifinalist in 2003 . The 1970 team won the National Invitation Tournament ; the NCAA tournament in 1970 included just 25 teams and the NIT had 16 .",
      "The nickname change to Golden Eagles came in May 1994 , despite another Jesuit school\u2014Boston College\u2014already being called the Eagles . In May 2005 , the university changed the nickname to Gold , but the decision was reversed after public backlash .",
      "On December 15 , 2012 , Marquette and the other six Catholic , non-FBS Big East schools ( the so-called Catholic 7 ) announced that they were departing the Big East for a new conference . In March 2013 , it was confirmed that the Catholic 7 , along with three other schools , would begin operations that July as a new Big East Conference .",
      "Varsity sports .",
      "Mens basketball .",
      "The mens basketball team is ninth in the NCAA for postseason appearances all-time ( 45 ) , including 30 NCAA Tournament appearances ( T-11th all time ) . The Warriors , coached by Al McGuire , won the 1977 NCAA Tournament and were runners-up in 1974 . Maurice Bo Ellis was a member of each of those teams , and remains the only Marquette player to appear in two Final Fours .",
      "The 2003 team , coached by Tom Crean and led on the court by Dwyane Wade , Robert Jackson , Steve Novak , and Travis Diener , upset top-ranked Kentucky to reach the Final Four of the 2003 NCAA Tournament . In that Midwest regional final in Minneapolis , Wade became the fourth player to record a triple-double in an NCAA tournament game . He was named an AP All-American two years in a row and was the Conference USA Player of the Year .",
      "Marquette has continued to re-emerge as a national power after 2003 . The program has made seven straight NCAA tournament appearances dating back to 2006 , and has made three consecutive NCAA Sweet 16 appearances in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 . In 2012 , Marquette experienced their best season since 2003 , tying the single season school record for wins ( 27 ) , finishing second place in the Big East for the first time in program history , and finishing ranked in the Top 10 of the AP and USA Today/Coaches Poll for the first time since 2003 . Jae Crowder was also named Big East Player of the Year , the first such conference player of the year honor for a Marquette player since Dwyane Wade in 2003 .",
      "The team plays in the nearby home of the Milwaukee Bucks , Fiserv Forum , which replaces the Bradley Center , home to both teams for 30 years , for the 2018\u201319 season and beyond .",
      "Conference affiliations",
      "The charter of the current Big East dates only to 2013 . However , the settlement between the schools that formed the current Big East and those that remained in the league now known as the American Athletic Conference gave the departing schools the Big East name . Additionally , The American recognizes none of the pre-2013 athletic history of the Big East\u2014even in football and womens rowing , the only two sports sponsored by the original Big East that are sponsored by The American but not the current Big East .",
      "Womens basketball .",
      "The womens basketball team is coached by Carolyn Kieger . The program has experienced success in recent years under former coach Terri Mitchells direction , including a run to the championship game of the WNIT , where the women finished as runners-up in 2006 , and won the championship in 2008 . Most recently , the team made it to the second round of the NCAA tournament in 2011 , where they were defeated by top-seeded Tennessee . Marquette womens basketball has qualified for the NCAA tournament seven times since 1994 . The team now plays in the Al McGuire Center , named after the former Marquette mens coach .",
      "The team notably hired Tyler Summitt , the 21-year-old son of legendary Tennessee coach Pat Summitt , as an assistant effective with the 2012\u201313 season , the announcement coming on the same day his mother announced her retirement after 38 years leading the Lady Vols .",
      "In 2006 , Marquette traveled to St . Thomas to participate in the Paradise Jam Tournament . In the opening round Marquette defeated Western Michigan 74\u201361 . In the second round Marquette defeated Auburn 65\u201361 . On the final day , Marquette beat Xavier 73\u201353 to finish with a 3\u20130 record and win the 2006 Paradise Jam Championship ( St . John division ) .",
      "Cross-country and track .",
      "The cross-country and track teams have produced five Olympians , 13 NCAA champions and 27 All-Americans . Except for Dwyane Wade , Marquettes most successful student-athlete was track and field sprinter Ralph Metcalfe , a world-record holder and Olympic gold medalist . Olympic silver medalist Melvin Bus Shimek ( 1904\u20131987 ) was the longtime coach of both programs ; he was a top distance runner at MU in the 1920s and coached until 1976 , the last 29 years as head coach , a total of 52 years as athlete and coach at Marquette . Shimek set the school record in the mile in 1927 and it held up for over thirty years .",
      "Both programs were dropped with football in December 1960 , but cross country was reinstated within weeks so the athletic program could retain its NCAA membership , which required a varsity intercollegiate sport in each season . Track missed three spring seasons ( 1961\u20131963 ) and returned in March 1964 , initially without scholarships .",
      "Football ( varsity ) .",
      "The varsity football team was known as the Golden Avalanche prior to the program being terminated in 1960 . Marquette football posted several successful seasons in the 1920s and 1930s including undefeated seasons in 1922 , 1923 , and 1930 . From 1922 to 1923 Marquette held a 17\u20130\u20131 record and outscored its opponents 374\u201315 . The 1930 Marquette squad posted seven shutouts and held a 155\u20137 scoring margin . From 1920 to 1936 Marquette held a 90\u201332\u20136 ( ) record . 1936 Golden Avalanche had a 7\u20131 regular season record with a top 20 ranking and played in the inaugural Cotton Bowl Classic against Texas Christian University , led by quarterback Sammy Baugh ; TCU won 16\u20136 .",
      "After accumulating several years of budget deficits for the university , the football program was dropped after a 3\u20136 season in 1960 under second-year coach Lisle Blackbourn , along with track and cross country programs . Their last successful season was 1953 and the last seven seasons had a combined 10\u201344\u20133 ( ) record , including two straight winless seasons ( 1956 and 1957 ) , under new head coach Johnny Druze . At the time , Marquette had a 78-year football tradition and was the largest Catholic university in the United States . Cross country was immediately reinstated and track returned in 1964 ; football at Marquette returned at the club level in 1967 .",
      "Marquette Stadium , the football teams home since 1924 , was dismantled in 1978 . Located in the Merrill Park neighborhood west of the university , the stadium had a seating capacity of 24,000 at its peak . It was used by Green Bay Packers of the NFL for three home games in 1952 ; the Packers played several home games in Milwaukee every season from 1933 through 1994 ; previous games were played State Fair Park in West Allis and succeeding years at the new County Stadium . Marquette played a majority of its home schedule at County Stadium in 1957 and 1958 .",
      "Mens golf .",
      "Marquette University fields only a mens team for golf . Former head coach , Tim Grogan , was honored as the Big East Conference Mens Golf Coach of the Year in 2006 and 2008 . The golf team holds Marquettes only Big East Championships , which were won in 2008 , 2015 , 2017 , and 2019 . Mike Van Sickle , class of 2009 , was named to the Ping Division I All-American Honorable Mention list in 2007 and 2008 . He was a first-team All-American in 2009 . Van Sickle currently holds the school record for single-season average at 70.00 strokes per 18 holes , and most sub-par rounds at 86 .",
      "Lacrosse .",
      "On December 16 , 2010 , the university announced that it would be adding mens and womens lacrosse teams to begin play as independents in the 2012\u201313 academic year , before becoming full members of the Big East Conference in mens and womens lacrosse in 2013\u201314 . The teams home field is Valley Fields .",
      "Soccer .",
      "The mens and womens soccer programs have achieved varying degrees of success . In 2006 , the mens team won just one game and finished last in their conference while the women made a run into the NCAA postseason tournament .",
      "Coach Louis Bennett recently joined the mens program after years of accomplishment at nearby Milwaukee to help the team match the womens success .",
      "In June 2007 , alumnus Dennis Klein donated $1 million to spearhead a new , $5 million European-style soccer stadium for Marquette . The new stadium is set to open in September 2008 .",

      "Pennsylvania Railroad class E44",
      "The PRR E44 was an electric , rectifier-equipped locomotive built by General Electric for the Pennsylvania Railroad between 1960 and 1963 . The PRR used them for freight service on the Northeast Corridor . They continued in service under Penn Central and Conrail until Conrail abandoned its electric operations in the early 1980s . They were then acquired by Amtrak and NJ Transit , where they lived short lives ; all were retired by the mid-1980s . One is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania .",
      "Design .",
      "By the late 1950s , with its P5a fleet aging , the Pennsylvania Railroad needed new electric freight locomotives . In fact , the PRR had never really had a successful electric freight locomotive . The P5a was originally built to haul passengers , being bumped from that duty by the more powerful GG1 . The GG1s were best at hauling passenger trains ; while also adequate for fast , time-sensitive freights , they were not as efficient on heavy freights ( especially coal and ore trains ) , at a time before roller bearings were widely used on freight cars . The PRR had purchased E2b , E2c , and E3b demonstrators , but was not particularly impressed , for a variety of reasons . The railroad even considered complete freight dieselization , and commissioned studies on this from builders Alco , GMs EMD and General Electric ; however , all three builders recommended retaining all existing electrification and acquiring new electric locomotives . The PRR took special note of twelve state-of-the-art EL-C electrics built by GE for the Virginian Railway , who was satisfied with their performance on their coal trains in the Blue Ridge Mountains . The PRR then approached GE about building a similar locomotive , resulting in an order for 66 such units in 1959 .",
      "The E44 was essentially a more powerful version of the EL-C ( later known as the E33 ) , with compared to the EL-Cs . One of the most notable differences in appearances between the two locomotives was the pantograph ( s ) : the El-C had one double-arm ( Stemmann ) pantograph , whereas the E44 had two single-arm ( Faiveley ) pantographs , a characteristic born of the PRRs operating practice of having two pantographs per locomotive . The EL-C , while of utilitarian design , also had a slightly more rounded appearance than the rather boxier E44 . While the E44 was short on aesthetics compared with the GG1 and P5 ( bricks being a particularly common sobriquet ) , the units were long on performance .",
      "General Electric constructed the first 60 E44s ( 4400-4459 ) using Ignitron rectifiers , and the final six units ( 4460-4465 ) with air-cooled silicon diode rectifiers . GE subsequently upgraded 22 of the units ( a few at a time ) to an E44a designation , boasting upgraded traction motors and silicon rectifier packages for an output of 5,000 horsepower . The 22 E44as were numbered ; the E44a program was terminated in 1970 due to the Penn Central bankruptcy . Conrail subsequently swapped out the Ignitrons in all of the remaining units for silicon diodes in the late 1970s and early 1980s , in-house and without any horsepower upgrades . In 1980 , GE took E44a 4453 in hand for rebuilding with upgraded electronics and uprating to 6,000 horsepower . Made redundant by Conrails discontinuance of electrified freight operations , the rebuilt 4453 was briefly tested on the Northeast Corridor in 1984 by GE , who then scrapped the unit several years later after salvaging the newer components .",
      "In the late 1960s , General Electric constructed two upgraded 5,000 horsepower ( 25,000 volt , 60 cycle ) units of the same E44 body style ( known as E50Cs ) for the Muskingum Electric Railroad , a private coal-carrying railroad owned by American Electric Power . Until it closed in 2002 , MERR shuttled coal in two automated consists from the mine to a powerplant at Relief , Ohio ( across from Beverly , OH ) .",
      "History .",
      "Pennsylvania Railroad .",
      "The Pennsylvania took delivery of 66 E44s between 1960\u201363 and they quickly displaced the P5s . The Pennsylvania used the E44s on just about any freight assignment imaginable , on all of its electrified lines . They could work both singly or lashed together as multiple units . They quickly proved to be very versatile and could handle just about any train , without helpers . The E44s dynamic braking , a novelty under PRR wires , made them just as sure-footed descending grades as climbing them ( although the brakes were not regenerative ) . They even occasionally hauled passenger trains in emergencies , although they were not very adept in this role , being ( officially ) limited to , having a pronounced oscillating tendency at speed on jointed rail , and of course lacking steam generators for passenger service .",
      "The units were delivered in an entirely new paint scheme . While adorned in the familiar PRR Brunswick Green , the units carried the sans-serif road name in yellow , flanked by two small PRR keystones , together with a keystone on the front and rear , and a large yellow road number . This scheme was unique to the E44 ; all subsequent diesel orders omitted the road name . The impact of the lettering was diminished by the fact that the units were seldom washed and became very grimy , due to the assignment of the units to diesel service facilities whose automatic car washers lacked overhead wiring .",
      "Penn Central and Conrail .",
      "After the 1968 Penn Central merger , the E44s remained in freight service , over the same territory as before , and ( unlike much of the Penn Central diesel fleet ) , as reliably as before . The paint scheme for most units was Penn Central black with the worms in love logo . At least one unit wore the short-lived red-P logo , with the P in the logo red instead of white . Not all units received a full Penn Central paint scheme , mainly due to the cash-strapped nature of the railroad , which went bankrupt in June 1970 . For example , some had white PC numbers and small worms on the ends , while a few never received any new lettering at all , instead having all their PRR markings simply patch-painted over except for their yellow numbers .",
      "In 1976 , they were passed to the newly formed Conrail . However , things changed when Conrail eliminated their electrification in 1981 . All 66 E44s were retired at that time , though some units were already stored due to economic downturn ; no unit had ever been retired or seriously wrecked . Most , though not all , of the E44s got to be repainted blue with Conrails white wheel on rail logo .",
      "Amtrak and NJ Transit .",
      "Despite their versatility , the E44s were suddenly about to be used in something they were never intended for : passenger service . Amtrak and New Jersey Transit , both short of electric locomotives , saw in the E44s an opportunity to obtain needed power at bargain-basement prices",
      "Amtrak painted them in its standard switcher paint ( gray body with black lettering ) , and switching work was mostly what they ended up doing . They did this adeptly for some years , until Amtrak decided maintaining these aging locomotives was not worth it . The PCB-laden coolant in their transformers also cut short their lives . Many were stored at Wilmington Shops in Wilmington , DE during the early to mid-1990 and they were eventually scrapped .",
      "It is not certain what exactly NJ Transit was looking for , but it evidently was not the E44 . All were sold to Amtrak . Like many of NJ Transits second-hand locomotives , their paint scheme was the previous owner ( Conrail ) s herald being painted out , and NJDOT ( New Jersey Department of Transportation ) written below the number .",
      "Preservation .",
      "PRR 4465 , the final production E44 , is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania . 4465 was completed in July 1963 , and later saw service with Amtrak as No . 502 ."

      "Hsu Hsin-liang",
      "Hsu Hsin-liang ( ; born 27 May 1941 ) is a Taiwanese politician , formerly Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) . He was a supporter of the Pan-Blue Coalition from 2000 to 2008 but then supported the DPP in the 2008 presidential election .",
      "Early life .",
      "Hsu was born in Ch\u016breki , Shinchiku Prefecture , Japanese Taiwan ( modern-day Zhongli , Taoyuan , Taiwan ) . He attended Hsinchu Senior High School and received his bachelors degree in political science from National Chengchi University in 1967 and his Kuomintang-sponsored masters degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1969 .",
      "Political career .",
      "Hsu began his political career in the Kuomintang as a member of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly from 1973 to 1977 . He was expelled from the Kuomintang but broke ranks in 1977 when he ran and won as an independent in the election for Magistrate of Taoyuan County . The Zhongli incident took place during the election after voters reported seeing a Kuomintang official destroy cast ballots .",
      "Hsu was involved in opposition activity during the first part of 1979 . The government impeached him and removed him from office for two years . On September 30 , 1979 , he left Taiwan for an exile in the United States where he maintained his position opposing the Kuomintang government .",
      "In 1986 , soon after the founding of the Democratic Progressive Party , he tried to return to Taiwan via Japan , but was repeatedly blocked at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport . Three years later he was arrested while slipping into Taiwan aboard a mainland Chinese fishing boat and was jailed for sedition until president Lee Teng-hui declared to have been pardoned in 1990 .",
      "He later joined the DPP and served as its chairman twice , from 1991 to 1993 and 1996 to 1998 . He attempted to transform the party from a radical pro-Taiwan independence party to a more moderate and electable political group that no longer supported immediate independence . Having failed twice in gaining DPP support for his presidential bid , first in 1996 when he lost the party primary to Peng Ming-min and second in 1999 when the party threw its support behind the widely popular former mayor of Taipei , Chen Shui-bian , Hsu chose to leave the DPP in 1999 .",
      "Hsu then ran in the 2000 presidential election as an independent with New Party legislator Josephine Chu as his running mate . During the campaign , he promoted unification based on one country , two systems . After the election , Hsu became more critical of the Chen Shui-bian government and its various policies . Hsu believes that maintaining a good relationship with the Peoples Republic of China is vital for Taiwans survival and growth , and there is no hurry to negotiate with mainland on political issues at the present . Instead , establishing a closer economic relationship across the strait will help Taiwans economy .",
      "Hsu publicly supported Lien Chen and James Soong in the 2004 presidential election . In March 2004 , Hsu and a dozen other prominent politicians involved in the Tangwai movement published The Joint Declaration of the Tang Wai participants ( \u9ee8\u5916\u4eba\u58eb\u806f\u5408\u8072\u660e , the joint declaration of the participants outside of the political party movement ) , in which they reprimanded Chen Shui-bian for betraying the ideals of democracy and freedom that they once pursued . Criticising Chen for being corrupted by power and close with Lee Teng-hui and black gold , Hsu and others urged voters who once supported DPP for its ideals not to vote for Chen , to give him a chance to reflect on himself .",
      "After the 2004 presidential election , Hsu , in protest of what he saw as an unfair election , arrived at Ketagalan Boulevard ( in front of the presidential palace ) on the night of March 24 and staged a three-day hunger strike . He believed firmly that Chen Shui-bian cheated in the election and thought he was now fighting for democracy , just as he did two decades ago .",
      "In July 2004 , he founded the Taiwan Democratic School , which is aimed at promoting a new democratic movement to sustain Taiwans young democracy . It has advocated unity within the Pan-Blue Alliance .",
      "In December 2004 he made an unsuccessful run in the Legislative Yuan election as an independent in the Taipei City South constituency . His platform opposed a NT$610.8 billion arms purchase from the U.S . and supported opening three direct links . Until 2006 , Hsu and another two former chairman of DPP , Shih and Lin , also left DPP due to dissatisfaction with Chens policies and corruptions .",
      "However , after the KMT won a two-thirds majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan in 2008 , Hsu became concerned about the party reverting to authoritarianism . Hsu then came out to support DPP candidate Frank Hsieh in the 2008 presidential election even though he had been connected with the pan-blue coalition camp during much of the period Chen Shui-bian served as president . After Chen left the office , Hsu backed to DPP . He has also been seen at events organized by the DPP since 2008 . On March 25 , 2011 , he registered to participate in the DPPs primary to select the partys candidate for the 2012 presidential election . In April 2012 , Hsu was nominated as a candidate for the DPP chairperson election to be held in May 2012 , but lost .",
      "Cross-strait relations .",
      "In mid-April 2013 during a press conference , Hsu called for a cross-strait political dialogue to rejuvenate the stagnant economy of Taiwan and for Taiwan to have a grand coalition government , adding that political dialogue with Beijing is not for political purpose , but rather to save the economy of Taiwan .",

      "The shows were broadcast live six to eight times a year from different cities in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . There were also seven open-air summer shows , broadcast from Amphitheatre Xanten , Pla\u00e7a de Toros de Palma de Mallorca , Disneyland Paris , Waldb\u00fchne Berlin , and Aspendos Roman Theatre . Each of the shows , which were shown without commercial interruption , were usually scheduled to last for about two hours , but it was not uncommon for a show to run as much as 45 minutes longer .",
      "History .",
      "On 14 February 1981 , the German channel ZDF broadcast the first episode in cooperation with the Austrian broadcaster ORF and the Swiss channel SF DRS . The inventor of the show , Frank Elstner , hosted the show until its 39th episode in 1987 . Wetten , dass.. ? has since been hosted by entertainer Thomas Gottschalk , except during a brief interval from 1992 to 1993 , when nine episodes were presented by Wolfgang Lippert . Gottschalk hosted his 100th episode of the show on 27 March 2004 .",
      "In summer 2007 , Wetten , dass.. ? had its first show in widescreen . Since late 2009 , Michelle Hunziker has assisted Gottschalk in hosting the show . The show on 27 February 2010 was the first show broadcast in HD . Thomas Gottschalk left the show on 3 December 2011 , the end of the 2011 season , because of an accident involving Samuel Koch , a 23-year-old man who became a quadriplegic due to a stunt which he performed on the show on 4 December 2010 .",
      "After long speculations who would take over the show , ZDF announced on 11 March 2012 that Markus Lanz would be the next presenter . His first show was on 6 October 2012 and the last show was on 13 December 2014 .",
      "The show was rebooted as a satirical homage with fake bets in 2016 for two episodes of 45 minutes each . It was hosted by comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann .",
      "Concept .",
      "The core gimmick of the show was the bets : ordinary people offer to perform some unusual ( often bizarre ) and very difficult task . Some examples , all of which were performed successfully , include :",
      "- Lighting a pocket lighter using an excavators shovel ( 19 February 1983 )",
      "- Assembling a V8 engine from parts and making it run within 9 minutes ( 2 November 1991 )",
      "- 13 swimmers towing a 312-tonne ship over a distance of 25 meters ( 7 October 1995 )",
      "- Recognising 5 of 6 ( out of a total of 75 ) species of birds blindfolded by feeling a single feather ( 9 November 2002 )",
      "- A Chinese martial artist pushing a car with a spear , the tip of which was resting on his throat",
      "- A nine-year-old boy from Vienna computing the shortest bus and railcar routes throughout the city from memory",
      "- A blindfolded farmer recognizing his cows by the sound they made while chewing apples",
      "The other major attraction of the show was the top-ranking celebrity guests , with considerable screen time given to the host greeting and chatting with them . Each of the guests had to bet on the outcome of one of the performances and offer a wager , in recent years usually a humorous or mildly humiliating , originally more charitable , activity to be carried out if they lose . Until 1987 , each of the celebrities bet on all the performances and the most accurate one was selected to be that shows Wettk\u00f6nig ( bet king ) . Ever since , one of the people performing the task is selected by a telephone vote . Celebrities that have appeared on the show included a vast range of personalities , with repeated guests including the likes of Britney Spears , Jennifer Lopez , Tom Cruise , Angelina Jolie , Cameron Diaz , Brad Pitt , Naomi Campbell , Michael Douglas , Michael Jackson , Jennifer Aniston , David Beckham , Hugh Grant , Arnold Schwarzenegger , Claudia Schiffer , Heidi Klum , Bill Gates , Karl Lagerfeld , Mikhail Gorbachev and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der .",
      "Additionally , until 2001 , members of the audience could offer bets against the host to find a certain number of unusual persons ( e.g . 10 ladies over the age of 65 driving motorbikes ) . One of these was selected at the beginning of the show and had to be fulfilled by its end . Since 2001 , the host bets against the entire city where the show is held .",
      "Between the bets and the celebrity smalltalk , there were musical performances by top-ranking artists like Take That , Jennifer Lopez , Coldplay , OneRepublic , Rihanna , Kiss , t.A.T.u. , Whitney Houston , Katy Perry , Michael Jackson , Madonna , Kylie Minogue , Anastacia , Avril Lavigne , Christina St\u00fcrmer , Bryan Adams , Shakira , Britney Spears , Scorpions , Bon Jovi , Meat Loaf , Elton John , Tokio Hotel , Justin Bieber , Miley Cyrus , Ashley Tisdale , Joe Cocker , Lady Gaga , Luciano Pavarotti , Celine Dion , Christina Aguilera , Mariah Carey , Robert Plant , Status Quo , Leona Lewis , David Bowie , Bruno Mars , Cher and Tina Turner .",
      "International versions .",
      "In the Netherlands , a version was broadcast between 1984 and 1999 under the name Wedden , dat.. ? by the AVRO and ( from the early nineties ) RTL 4 . The Dutch shows were hosted by Jos Brink until 1993 , after which Rolf Wouters took over . Reinout Oerlemans presented the show for one season in 1999 .",
      "Wetten , dass.. ? inspired the British series You Bet! . It was produced by London Weekend Television and was broadcast on ITV from 1988 to 1997 . The hosts were Bruce Forsyth ( 1988\u20131990 ) , Matthew Kelly ( 1991\u20131995 ) , and Darren Day ( 1996\u20131997 ) .",
      "In October 2004 , Wetten , dass.. ? also started in the Chinese television under the title Wanna Challenge ( as gambling is illegal in China ) . It is shown once a week and reaches 60 million viewers each episode .",
      "In 1998 , a Slovenian version of Wetten , dass.. ? started weekly on POP TV under the title Super Pop hosted by Stojan Auer . There were initiations of close production connections with the original Wetten , dass..? , but the show was canceled because of high production costs before any further common productions were made .",
      "The show was also broadcast with great success in Italy by Rai 1 from 1991 to 1996 ( and then in 1999 , 2001 , and 2003 ) with the title Scommettiamo che...? . In 2008 it was taken up again by Rai 2 . It has had ten seasons .",
      "In 2005 and 2006 , a Polish version was broadcast under the name Za\u0142\u00f3\u017c si\u0119 .",
      "In 2006 and 2007 a Russian version was broadcast on the Channel One under the name \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440 ( Bolshoy Spor , literally A Big Betting ) . The host was Dmitry Nagiev . The show was closed after the 7th episode due to its low popularity .",
      "\u00bfQu\u00e9 Apostamos ? was the Spanish version of the show . It originally run on Spains national broadcaster TVE 1 between 4 May 1993 and 30 June 2000 . The show was fronted by Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda , accompanied by Ana Obreg\u00f3n ( 1993\u20131998 ) , Antonia DellAtte ( 1998\u20131999 ) , and Raquel Navamuel and M\u00f3nica Mart\u00ednez ( 2000 ) . If the audience bet was completed , the person that placed the bet had to be drenched in water , and if it was not completed one of the presenters or guests had to take the water shower . In 2008 , the Spanish federation of regional TV stations operating under the FORTA umbrella later recovered the format , hosted by Carlos Lozano and Roc\u00edo Madrid , but the revival was short lived and was swiftly axed due to low ratings and the high cost of producing the programme .",
      "In 2006 , ABC signed with reality producer Phil Gurin of The Gurin Company to develop an American version of the show . Six episodes were broadcast in July\u2013September 2008 , hosted by British duo Ant & Dec . This is not the first time the show has been produced for American audiences ; in 1993 , CBS broadcast a pilot called Wanna Bet? , hosted by Mark McEwen , which was not picked up as a full series .",
      "There are also plans to show Wetten , dass.. ? in India , Northern Africa , and the Middle East .",
      "Additional information .",
      "- There was an instance where Frank Elstner lost a private bet himself ; he had bet with his family that his colleague and friend Kurt Felix would never fool him . ( Kurt Felix ran a show similar to Candid Camera , called Verstehen Sie Spa\u00df ? ( Can You Take a Joke? ) . On the 29th show ( 21 September 1985 ) , after a successful outdoor challenge which involved uncorking a bottle of wine and filling four glasses with a gripper claw fixed to a helicopters skid within the space of minutes , the pilot was invitedalong with the guestsfor a drink of wine . But the contents of the bottle turned out to be pure vinegar , as Elstner discovered when he was the first to take a sample , and the red-haired and bearded pilot revealed himself to the laughing audience as Kurt Felix in disguise . As Felix would later admit in one of his later Verstehen Sie Spa\u00df ? broadcastings , it was he and his production team who had sent the bet to the ZDF in the first place .",
      "- In a special on German TV , Elstner said , Wetten , dass.. ? had the chance to have Pope John Paul II on the show , but only via video link , not direct in person . Elstner refused , because this could be precedent for future celebrities and famous people to come on the show via video link and not appear in person on the set . Elstner regretted the once-in-a-lifetime chance to have the pope on his show and said it was the greatest mistake of his career .",
      "- Actor Karl-Heinz B\u00f6hm initiated his long-time charity project Menschen f\u00fcr Menschen in the 3rd show : Regarding a famine in the Sahel , he said at the end of the show : I bet that not even one third of our viewers in Austria , Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany will donate one Deutsche Mark for the starving people in the Sahel . And I want to lose this bet . If he lost , B\u00f6hm added , he would himself travel to Africa to hand over the money . Even though B\u00f6hm won the bet , as total donations were only around 1.2 million DM , he traveled to Africa and started his aid project for Ethiopia .",
      "- In the 25th show on 15 December 1984 , environmental activists ran in front of the cameras with a banner that read Nicht wettenDonauauen retten ( Dont betsave the Danube wetlands ) . When they were pulled out of the way by the shows security , Frank Elstner commanded that no one was to be thrown out of his show . He let the activists make their request and they left the show peacefully . The banner was for the then Austrian chancellor Fred Sinowatz , who was a guest on that show .",
      "- In the 48th show on 3 September 1988 , an editor of the German satirical magazine Titanic , Bernd Fritz , snuck into the show as a contestant under the pseudonym Thomas Rautenberg . The real Thomas Rautenberg , a graphic artist from Munich , offered his bet to Wetten , dass..? , to see how the ZDF would react . He claimed to recognize the colour of pencils by tasting them . Bernd Fritz took the bet to the show and won the bet . However he admitted he was cheating and the solution of how he did it could be read in the next issue of Titanic . Gottschalk then told the audience that he would read the magazine , and tell the trick in the next show , so that the magazine wouldnt get the publicity from this stunt . It was later explained that the blacked ski goggles that contestants wear if they need their vision removed for the bet , were adjusted by Fritz so he could peek through a gap along his nose to see the colour of the pencil . The host tested the visibility through the goggles by faking punches against Fritz eyes and seeing if he would try to dodge them , but after the test it seemed as if Fritz adjusted the goggles to a more comfortable position before he attempted the bet . Since then , swimming goggles with a rubber sealing that sticks to the skin have been used .",
      "- In a show in 1992 , actress Whoopi Goldberg came onto the show for a bet . Goldberg lost and as a result , she had to cast Gottschalk in her next movie . That movie was where Gottschalk played the German cook , Father Wolfgang .",
      "- In the 102nd show on 8 December 1996 , a live bet at the Russian space station Mir was planned . The cosmonauts wanted to decorate a Christmas tree in zero gravity in two minutes . Because of technical problems , however , the station couldnt be contacted during the show .",
      "- Salma Hayek is credited for restarting the popular trend of wearing Trachten ( German for costumes , specifically Lederhosen for men and Dirndl for women ) . Wearing Trachten to the Oktoberfest wasnt fashionable for several decades after the second World War , and most of visitors wore the regular clothes . She appeared on the show on 5 October 2008 . Salma would have to dress in a Dirndl if she was wrong . Salma decided that the boy would not be successful in assembling a tower of 20 beer crates placed upon one after one and climbing up . The boy failed his mission so Salma didnt have to wear the Dirndl presented to her . In a surprise move , Salma indicated she would like to try on Dirndl and see how it looked on her . The audience erupted in applause as she walked off the stage . When she returned to the stage with her Dirndl , Karl Lagerfeld was applauding so loudly and couldnt stop looking at her Dirndl . Salma commented how besotted she was about Dirndl and wanted to keep it .",
      "Cancellation .",
      "Samuel Koch incident .",
      "Samuel Koch , a 23-year-old aspiring stuntman , became a quadriplegic during a stunt performed on the show on 4 December 2010 . The incident was broadcast live . The contestant took on a bet in which he was to try to jump over five moving cars using spring-loaded boots . The cars were of gradually increasing size . While the first and the third jumps were successful ( the second one was aborted ) , the stunt went wrong during the fourth jump when Koch failed to clear the car , driven by his own father . Kochs head hit the windshield while he was inverted , and he then landed awkwardly on the studio floor , taking the impact on his head . The contestant fractured two cervical vertebrae and damaged his spinal cord .",
      "Koch was transported to a nearby hospital , where emergency surgery was performed upon him . Koch survived but is now paralyzed for life from his neck down . The episode was interrupted and terminated prematurely about 20 minutes later , for the first time ever in the programs history . The ZDF has stated that both the episode and the segment depicting the accident will never be broadcast again . In the follow-up Wetten , dass.. ? episode , Thomas Gottschalk announced his decision to resign as the shows host after the last installment of the 2011 season , with the accident being a major motivation to do so .",
      "Decline .",
      "Following Gottschalks retirement , ZDF TV host Markus Lanz took over the hosting of the show ( debuting on 6 October 2012 ) . However , his approach to the show did not meet public or critical approval , causing the show to experience a drastic ratings loss . Eventually , with the conclusion of the 2014 Offenburg show ( 5 April 2014 ) , it was announced that the show would be cancelled at the close of 2014 , official statements claiming out-moded concepts as the main reason for this decision . This announcement drew protests from both Frank Elstner and Thomas Gottschalk . However , it was also stated that an eventual revival would be considered .",
      "The 215th and last regular show was broadcast on 13 December 2014 from Nuremberg , with Samuel Koch \u2013 who never blamed Wetten , dass.. ? or Gottschalk for his condition \u2013 being one of the prominent guests .",
      "On 28 July 2018 , ZDF announced a one-evening revival of Wetten , dass..? , owing to the occasion of Gottschalks upcoming 70th birthday ( 18 May 2020 ) . It was later announced that the special would not happen in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . It will instead air live in 2021 ."

      "The club was founded on 25 August 2016 , as FC Buz\u0103u , being renamed as SCM Gloria Buz\u0103u in the summer of 2018 at once with the inclusion as the football section of the newly founded sports club of the city , SCM Gloria Buz\u0103u . The Glorious Ones achieved three consecutive promotions from the fifth tier up to Liga II , in the Liga III being undefeated for almost all the season .",
      "Founded as a chance of continuity for the football in Buz\u0103u , the club does not hold the record of the old team ( FC Gloria Buz\u0103u ) , but enjoys the support of the local fans ( including the ultras group Peluza Cr\u00e2ng ) , who consider it as the main club of the city and the successor , at least unofficially , of the football history from the Cr\u00e2ng park .",
      "History .",
      "FC Gloria Buz\u0103u ( 1973\u20132016 ) .",
      "FC Gloria Buz\u0103u , the original football club of the city , was founded on 16 June 1973 , by the Buz\u0103u County Local Council , as part of CSM Buz\u0103u ( Clubul Sportiv Municipal ) ( En : Municipal Sports Club ) , the local all-sports association . Gloria absorbed the former team of Buz\u0103u , Metalul , whose place it also took in the Divizia C ( currently Liga III ) . With Metaluls players , together with other local footballers ( especially from another team , \u0218oimii ) , they ranked 1st in their first season of Divizia C . Gloria won the subsequent Divizia B promotion play-off tournament and thus won promotion in their first year of existence .",
      "On 26 May 2016 , the Romanian Football Federation fined 14 players and three managers of FC Gloria for match-fixing in the Liga II , in 10 matches between September 2014 and May 2015 and imposed a total ban of 174 months on them . At the end of the 2015\u201316 Liga II season , Gloria had to face Olimpia Satu Mare in a relegation play-off in June but the club did not compete after it did not have enough players to line up once the bans had come into effect . Along with these developments the club went into bankruptcy after decades of ups and downs , in which the club spent only seven seasons in the top-flight of the Romanian football , where it achieved as a best finish a 5th place .",
      "First years and ascension ( 2016\u2013present ) .",
      "After the bankruptcy of FC Gloria Buz\u0103u , businessman Ionel Turturic\u0103 founded a new club , FC Buz\u0103u , which was enrolled in the Liga V \u2013 Buz\u0103u County . After only one season , the new club , which also had players with many matches played for FC Gloria Buz\u0103u , promoted to Liga IV with a total of 63 points , 7 points ahead the second place .",
      "In the summer of 2017 FC Buz\u0103u was renamed as SCM Gloria Buz\u0103u , as part of the city new sports club SCM Gloria Buz\u0103u , and at the end of the 2017\u201318 season promoted again , this time in the Liga III .",
      "In the 2018\u201319 season of Liga III SCM Gloria managed to promote for the third consecutive year , this time in the Liga II , after winning the first series of the third tier , series in which they had tough matches against teams such as O\u021belul Gala\u021bi , Foresta Suceava , Bucovina R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi or Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b , under these conditions the red and blues suffered their first defeat only in the last round , having the best run of all the series winners .",
      "Ground .",
      "The club plays its home matches , like its predecessor , FC Gloria Buz\u0103u , on Municipal Stadium from Buz\u0103u , with a capacity of 12,000 seats . Municipal Stadium was opened in 1942 , is located in the Cr\u00e2ng park , hence the nickname Cr\u00e2ng ( Grove ) . The arena was renovated several times since its opening ceremony ( 1971\u20131976 , 2005\u20132007 , 2008 ) . The last renovations works were made in the summer of 2018 when the pitch of the stadium was changed .",

      "Stephen C . West",
      "Stephen Craig West FRS ( born 11 April 1952 ) is a British biochemist and molecular biologist specialising in research on DNA recombination and repair . He is known for pioneering studies on genome instability diseases including cancer . West obtained his BSc in 1974 , and his PhD in 1977 , both from Newcastle University . He is currently a Senior Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London . He is an honorary Professor at University College London , and at Imperial College London . He was awarded the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine in 2007 , is a fellow of the Royal Society , the Academy of Medical Sciences , an International Member of the National Academy of Sciences , and an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Stephen West was born on 11 April 1952 in Hessle , Yorkshire , to Joseph Clair West , a fishbuyer , and Louise West . Although he came from a working-class background , he did well enough at his local school ( Hessle High School ) to go to Newcastle University where he studied Biochemistry . He graduated with a BSc in 1974 , and stayed in Newcastle to complete his PhD in 1977 . His thesis advisor was Peter Emmerson .",
      "Career .",
      "During his PhD work , he became interested in how cells recombine their DNA and use recombination for DNA repair . In 1977 , he identified \u2018protein X\u2019 as the elusive RecA protein , which is essential for recombination and repair in bacteria . After finishing his PhD , which he completed within three years , he moved to the United States to join the group led by Paul Howard-Flanders , one of the early pioneers in the field of DNA repair . In 1985 , West moved back to the United Kingdom and established his own group at the Imperial Cancer Research Funds laboratories in South Mimms in Hertfordshire , which subsequently became known as Cancer Research UK . His colleagues at Clare Hall laboratory included the Nobel Prize winners Tim Hunt and Tomas Lindahl . In 2016 , his laboratory moved to the new Francis Crick Institute in London .",
      "Research .",
      "Highlights of research .",
      "In the Howard-Flanders group at Yale University , West purified and characterised RecA protein , and in doing so discovered many key aspects relating to the way that cells mediate DNA-DNA interactions and strand exchange . Parallel studies were carried out in the groups of Charles Radding ( also at Yale University ) and Robert Lehman ( Stanford University ) . These three laboratories provided the groundwork for our current understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms of recombination .",
      "After moving to the UK in 1985 , West continued his work in bacterial systems , and set about trying to identify cellular proteins capable of resolving recombination intermediates . He identified RuvC as the first cellular enzyme that resolves recombination intermediates and characterised how this nuclease cuts Holliday junctions . He was also the first to show that RuvA and RuvB are motor proteins that mediate Holliday junction branch migration . His biochemical studies were compounded by genetic work from the laboratory of Robert Lloyd ( University of Nottingham ) .",
      "West\u2019s laboratory then moved into eukaryotic systems , where he discovered eukaryotic Holliday junction resolvases ( yeast Yen1 and human GEN1 ) . The identification of GEN1 was the culmination of 18 years of research , and opened up the field to allow a genetic analysis of the pathways by which recombination intermediates are processed . Present understanding indicates that there are three distinct pathways of Holliday junction processing in human cells involving BLM-topoIII\u03b1-RMI1-RMI2 , MUS81-EME1 and GEN1 . His laboratory discovered that the Holliday junction resolvase activities of MUS81 and GEN1 are regulated so that they act late in the cell cycle to ensure chromosome segregation .",
      "In addition to the discovery of cellular Holliday junction resolvases , West was the first to purify the human RAD51 protein ( the eukaryotic ortholog of RecA ) , and to show that it promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions similar to those mediated by RecA . In addition , he purified and then visualised the BRCA2 breast cancer tumour suppressor , showing that it acts as a molecular chaperone for the association RAD51 with DNA . His laboratory also discovered that Aprataxin , which is defective in a progressive neurological disorder known as Oculomotor apraxia , is a 5-deadenylase that removes AMP from 5-termini following abortive DNA ligation .",
      "As it is clear that DNA repair plays a critical role in the maintenance of genome stability and cancer avoidance , West\u2019s work is significant in terms of understanding the molecular basis of human disease . He is in great demand as an international speaker , and gives several keynote lectures each year as a fine communicator of the intricacies of DNA recombination and repair .",
      "Other professional activities .",
      "West is on the editorial boards of a number of journals including e-Life ( 2014-2016 ) , EMBO Journal ( 1996-2020 ) and EMBO Reports .",
      "He has been a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Leibniz Institute on Aging , Fritz Lippman Institute , Jena , Germany , and is currently on the SABs of the Center for Chromosome Instability , University of Copenhagen , Denmark , the China Medical University ( Taiwan ) , the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Genome Stability in Shenzen , China , and the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry , Martinsreid , Germany .",
      "He is a serial conference organiser , having organised ( or co-organised ) more than 30 conferences throughout his career . Currently , he is the organiser of the biennial International Conference on \u2018Mechanisms of Recombination\u2019 . The next meeting in the series will take place in May 2023 .",

At that time , he took command of the dispatch gunboat , and established a close friendship with the then Assistant Secretary of the Navy , Franklin D . Roosevelt , who cruised with him on the ship . He was in that assignment in early 1917 in West Indian waters and had additional duty as Senior Aide on the Staff of Commander Squadron Three of the Patrol Force Atlantic Fleet .",

Leahy oversaw the development of military bases and stations across the island while serving as governor . He took an open stance of not intervening directly in local politics , attempted to understand and respect local customs , and initiated various major public works projects in the island .",
      "While given the unflattering sobriquet Almirante Lija ( Admiral Sandpaper ) by locals , based on his family name , he was regarded as one of the most lenient American governors of the several who served Puerto Rico in the first half of the 20th century .",

      "The United States supplied food and medical aid to the Vichy regime and to French North Africa , hoping in return to moderate Vichy collaboration with Germany and to avoid an open Vichy\u2013German alliance in the Mediterranean .

      "Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief .",
      "After the United States entered World War II , President Roosevelt decided he needed a senior military officer as personal adviser and point of contact with his three service chiefs , Admiral Ernest King of the Navy , General George Marshall of the Army and General Henry Arnold of the Army Air Forces . The service chiefs resisted this move until Marshall suggested that only Leahy would be accepted in this post . On July 6 , 1942 , Leahy was appointed Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief , U.S .

      "Leahy spent D-Day , June 6 , 1944 , in his home town of Hampton , Iowa . This well-publicized sentimental journey was part of the deception efforts surrounding the Allied invasion of Europe . The idea was to lull any German agents in Washington , D.C. , or elsewhere in the United States into believing that the operation would not take place while such an important officer was out of the capital .",
      "In July 1944 , Leahy accompanied President Roosevelt to the Pacific Strategy Conference in Hawaii at which Roosevelt met Admiral Chester Nimitz ( commander of the Pacific Ocean Areas ) and General Douglas MacArthur ( commander of the Southwest Pacific Area ) to decide the course of the war in the Pacific theater .",
      "Leahy was promoted to the rank of Fleet Admiral on December 15 , 1944 , the most senior of the seven men who received five star rank in 1944 .",
      "Leahy accompanied President Roosevelt as his personal aide to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 . At Yalta Roosevelt met the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to decide how Europe was to be reorganized after the impending surrender of Germany . Five months later , he went with President Truman to the Potsdam Conference where Truman met with Stalin and the new British Prime Minister Clement Attlee to make decisions about the governance of occupied Germany .",
      "Atomic bomb .",
      "According to Trumans Memoirs : Year of Decisions , Leahy had stated in 1945 to President Truman :",
      "Once the bomb was tested , Leahy became strongly opposed to its use in Hiroshima and Nagasaki . In his own memoirs , Leahy wrote :",
      "After mediating between the United States Navy and the Puerto Rican government over the involuntary transfer of part of the islands of Vieques and Culebra to naval authorities , Leahy again retired from the Navy in March 1949 , though as an officer with five-star rank , he technically remained on active service . The following year , he published his war memoirs , I Was There .",
      "There is a bilingual book called Las memorias de Leahy : los relatos del almirante William D . Leahy sobre su gobernaci\u00f3n de Puerto Rico ( 1939\u20131940 ) that lists his diary entries from Puerto Rico in both Spanish and English , which was published by the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn Foundation in 2001 .",
      "Personal life .",
      "While serving on the , which was based in San Francisco , Leahy met Louise Tennent Harrington , whom he married on 3 February 1904 . During Leahys tenure as Ambassador to France , his wife underwent a hysterectomy , which could not be delayed until their pending return to the United States . While recovering from the operation , Louise Leahy suffered an embolism and died with Leahy at her side on 21 April 1942 . After a service at the St Thomas Episcopal Church , she was buried on 3 June 1942 in Arlington National Cemetery .",
      "William and Louise had children , including a son , William Harrington Leahy , who graduated from the U.S . Naval Academy in 1927 . He engaged in pre-World War II naval intelligence . William H . Leahy retired from the U.S . Navy as a 2-star rear admiral in 1961 .",
      "Death .",
      "Leahy died at the U.S . Naval Hospital in Bethesda , Maryland , July 20 , 1959 , at the age of eighty-four .

      "The News Quiz",
      "The News Quiz is a British topical panel game broadcast on BBC Radio 4 .",
      "History .",
      "The News Quiz was first broadcast in 1977 with Barry Norman as chairman . Subsequently , it was chaired by Barry Took from 1979 to 1981 , Simon Hoggart from 1981 to 1986 , Barry Took again from 1986 to 1995 , and then again by Simon Hoggart from 1996 until March 2006 . Hoggart was replaced by Sandi Toksvig in September 2006 , who in turn was replaced by Miles Jupp in September 2015 until his departure at the end of 2019 . Three different hosts took the chair in 2020 , Nish Kumar ( series 101 ) , Angela Barnes ( series 102 ) , and Andy Zaltzman ( series 103 ) . At the end of series 103 it was announced that Zaltzman would continue as permanent host . The series was created by John Lloyd based on an idea from Nicholas Parsons .",
      "Originally Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams and Punch editor Alan Coren acted as team captains .",
      "It was adapted for television in 1981 under the title Scoop , running for two series , and later inspired the television programme Have I Got News for You .",
      "In 2012 the BBC piloted an American version hosted by Lewis Black .",
      "On 28 June 2013 , the News Quiz paid tribute to Radio 4 announcer Rory Morrison , who used to read the news cuttings on the programme .",
      "During series 97 , running from August to October 2018 , Jupp was absent due to filming commitments overseas , so show regulars Simon Evans , Susan Calman , Fred MacAulay , Bridget Christie , Jo Brand and Lucy Porter took turns in the hosts seat . Jupp himself chaired the first and last episodes of the series .",
      "In May 2019 it was announced that Jupp would leave the show at the end of the 99th series at the end of the month . Series 100 had several hosts : Nish Kumar , Angela Barnes , Andy Zaltzman , Phil Wang , Kiri Pritchard-McLean , Zoe Lyons , Patrick Kielty and Andrew Maxwell . The hosts for 2020 are Nish Kumar , Angela Barnes and Andy Zaltzman . Zaltzman was named as the permanent host at the conclusion of series 103 .",
      "Transmission .",
      "The programme is usually recorded in front of an audience on Thursday evenings at the BBC Radio Theatre at Broadcasting House in central London . It is then edited and broadcast first on Friday evening at 18:30 , then repeated on the Saturday lunchtime . The final 28 minute show is significantly shorter than the original recording . In 2012 the BBC began making an extended version for BBC Radio 4 Extra .",
      "Each week , four panellists appear on the show . They are usually either comedians or journalists , and sometimes politicians . Journalists predominated in the early years . The ostensible purpose of the show is to test contestants knowledge of the events of the previous week by asking questions which are usually oblique references to those events . However this has given way to a general free-for-all where panellists chime in with their own humorous and satirical remarks once the question has been answered . The participants frequently wander off topic . The host ends the discussion of each question with a summary of the events it refers to , usually with a scripted comic punchline , before asking the next question . It is not uncommon for the show to get through only two rounds of the panel before the final section is reached . Before the host announces the largely symbolic scores , the panellists read out statements from newspapers and other media which they find amusing .",

      "The company was known as CacheFlow until 2002 .",
      "The company had a broad security portfolio including hardware , software and services . The company was best known for web gateway appliances that scan internet traffic for security threats , authenticate users and manage encrypted traffic , as well as products to monitor and filter employee internet activity . It also produced consumer products , such as parental control software . The companys products were initially sold to internet service providers , but later products were intended for large companies .",
      "History .",
      "In March 1996 , the company was founded as CacheFlow , Inc . in Redmond , Washington by Michael Malcolm , a computer scientist and professor at the University of Waterloo , Joe Pruskowski , and Doug Crow . The company initially raised $1 million in seed money from a dozen angel investors .",
      "The companys goal was to develop appliances that would increase website speed by storing frequently accessed web data in the cache .",
      "In October 1996 , Benchmark Capital purchased 25% of the company for $2.8 million , equivalent to a price of 87.5 cents per share . By February 1997 , the company had raised $5.1 million . In December 1997 , U.S . Venture Partners acquired 17% of the company for $6 million .",
      "In 1997 , the company moved its headquarters to Silicon Valley .",
      "In January 1998 , the company released its first product , the CacheFlow 1000 . It cached website objects that users were likely to use repeatedly , to increase load speed . In October 1999 , the CacheOS operating system was released .",
      "In April 1998 , the company released the CacheFlow 100 .",
      "In mid-1998 , during the dot-com bubble , the company made its first sales , earning just $809,000 over three months , and investors started pushing for an initial public offering ( IPO ) .",
      "In March 1999 , Technology Crossover Ventures invested $8.7 million for 7% of the company , equivalent to a price of $4.575 per share .",
      "In September 1999 , the company released the CacheFlow 500 , with a list price of $9,995 . A competitive review of caching appliances in PC Magazine gave the CacheFlow 500 Editors Choice . The editor said it had excellent performance , a plug-and-go setup , and good management tools . The review noted that its most noteworthy features were its DNS caching and object pipelining techniques , which allowed page data to be delivered in parallel , rather than sequential , streams .",
      "In early November 1999 , Marc Andreessen invested $3.1 million in shares , at a price of $11.04 per share .",
      "On November 19 , 1999 , during the peak of the dot-com bubble , the company became a public company via an initial public offering , raising $132 million . Shares rose fivefold on its first day of trading . However , the company was not profitable and its product was unproven . At that time , the company had $3.6 million in revenue and $6.6 million in losses in the prior 3 months . The company had initially hoped to price its shares at $11-13 each and raise $50 million but due to strong demand , it priced its shares at $26 each . One month later , they traded as high as $182 each .",
      "In 1999 , board of directors member Andrew Rachleff of Benchmark Capital , an investor , brought in Brian NeSmith , who had just sold his company , Ipsilon Networks , to Nokia for $120 million , as chief executive officer .",
      "In 2000 , it introduced the CacheFlow Server Accelerator product family , which offloads content delivery tasks from web servers .

      "Blue Coat devices are what is known as a dual-use technology , because they can be used both to defend corporate networks and by governments to censor and monitor the publics internet traffic . The appliances can see some types of encrypted traffic , block websites or record website traffic .",
      "In October 2011 , the U.S . government examined claims made by Telecomix , a hacktivist group , that Syria was using Blue Coat Systems products for internet censorship . Telecomix released 54GB of log data alleged to have been taken from 7 Blue Coat web gateway appliances that depict search terms , including Israel and proxy , that were blocked in the country using the appliances . The company later acknowledged that its systems were being used in Syria , but asserted the equipment was sold to intermediaries in Dubai for use by an Iraqi governmental agency .",
      "Despite the systems consistently sending heartbeat pings directly back to Blue Coat , the company claimed not to be monitoring the logs to identify from which country an appliance is communicating . Blue Coat announced that it would halt providing updates , support and other services for systems operating in Syria . In April 2013 , the Bureau of Industry and Security announced a $2.8 million civil settlement with Computerlinks FZCO , a Dubai reseller , for violations of the Export Administration Regulations related to the transfer to Syria of Blue Coat products .",
      "The companys devices were also used to block the public from viewing certain websites in Bahrain , Qatar , and U.A.E. , among others . By 2013 , Citizen Lab had published 3 reports regarding the companys devices being found in countries known for using technology to violate human rights . It identified 61 countries using Blue Coat devices , including those known for censoring and surveilling their citizens internet activity , such as China , Egypt , Russia , and Venezuela . However , it remains unclear exactly how the technologies are being used , but experts say the tools could empower repressive governments to spy on opponents ."

      "Harry Holtzman ( June 8 , 1912 \u2013 September 25 , 1987 ) was an American artist and founding member of the American Abstract Artists group .",
      "Early life .",
      "At the age of fourteen , Holtzman visited the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme\u2019s 1926 \u201cInternational Exhibition of Modern Art\u201d at the Brooklyn Museum and developed an early interest in advanced art with the guidance and encouragement of a high school teacher .",
      "At sixteen , in 1928 , he began attending the Art Students League of New York and became an active participant in League activities , serving as a monitor and contributing to the quarterly magazine . At a membership meeting in early 1932 , Holtzman\u2019s remarks against the xenophobia of the League\u2019s director were instrumental in carrying a membership vote that brought George Grosz and Hans Hofmann to teach at the League . At the close of this meeting , Burgoyne Diller , a Hofmann prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , taken by Holtzman\u2019s independence of mind , introduced himself , beginning an important lasting relationship . ( 1 ) ( 5 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 )",
      "In this period and working directly from the nude Harry Holtzman produced a wide corpus of drawings that reveals a progressive evolution towards abstraction , expressing his clearly understanding of the C\u00e9zannes lesson. ( 1 ) ( 3 )",
      "Step by step his work , using his own words , become absolutely pure , very much in a kind of expressionist so called abstract expressionism vene ( 3 ) Harry Holtzman was part of the first exhibition of abstract art organized at the Art Student League , with B.Diller , Albert Swinden , Albert Wilkenson . ( 1 )",
      "From 1933 the Abstract research of the artist evolves then into a series of rectilinear works , basically an independent abstraction from external objects , an important work of this period is Dynamic Equilibrium of Movement and Contromovement ( #661 Estate of Harry Holtzman ) .",
      "An untitled gouache painting of the same year ( # 606 Estate of Harry Holtzman ) shows the carried on argument with Diller over whether circular forms could be integrated into a grid arrangement without seeming to be indiscreet and arbitrary , from this discussion Harry Holtzman decided they could not . ( 9 ) ( 11 )",
      "By January 1934 , Holtzman recalls ,",
      "In the ensuing months , Holtzman",
      "By the end of November , Holtzman had raised enough money to pay for passage to France . In mid-December he introduced himself to Mondrian in the Dutch artist\u2019s Paris studio . Despite a language barrier and an age difference of forty years , the two men became good friends during the four months of Holtzman\u2019s stay in Paris .",
      "When Holtzman returned to New York City in 1935 , he joined the WPA Federal Art project , but was first assigned to write for the public relations department , since his art was considered too extreme for public placement . When Diller was promoted as managing supervisor of the Mural Division in New York , he appointed Holtzman as his assistant supervisor in charge of the abstract mural painters . In 1936 Holtzman was instrumental in bringing together the nucleus of painters and sculptors who established the American Abstract Artists in 1937 . Although he opposed the group\u2019s emphasis on exhibitions , and the attempts of certain influential members to exclude all but \u201cpure-abstractionists\u201d , Holtzman maintained an active role for several years , serving as secretary in 1938 and again in 1940 and arranged for the three-week AAA exhibition and its educational component at the American Art Today Building of the New York World\u2019s Fair in 1940 , directed by Holger Cahill .",
      "New York during WWII .",
      "During the German Blitz of London in 1940 , Holtzman arranged for Mondrian to come to New York , where he arrived that October . Holtzman rented an apartment-studio for him , and during the next three and a half years he was one of Mondrian\u2019s most intimate associates . ( 1 ) ( 2 )",
      "Of a painting construction ( Sculpture 1941 ) by Harry Holtzman now in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery , Piet Mondrian commented : \u201cIn the present three dimensional works of H.H . ( Harry Holtzman ) the picture moves still more from the wall into our surrounding space . In this way the painting more literally annihilates the three dimensional volume.\u201d ( letter to Harry Holtzman 6 1 1942 cited by Daniel Abadie in the catalogue Paris New York Paris , Paris Musee National dArt Moderne Centre Georges Pompidou 1977 ) ( 2 ) ( 4 )",
      "The piece , included in the Spring Salon for Young Artists ( 18 May - 26 June 1943 ) at the Art of This Century gallery in New York , was also shown in the Maya Derens film Witchs Cradle filmed at the AoTC during the August 1943 .",
      "Holtzman was associated with the Atelier 17 printmaking studio .",
      "According to Nancy J . Troy Holtzmans sculptures are akin to works by European and American artists who sought to apply Mondrians principle of Neoplasticism into the three dimensions . Cesar Domela , Jean Gorin , B Diller , worked out from the painted surface but still adhering to that surface for their overall concept . Harry Holtzman set out in a new direction by working in the round . ( 4 )",
      "As executor of Mondrian\u2019s Estate , Holtzman continued his involvement with Mondrian\u2019s art and in 1983 he co-edited a volume of Mondrian\u2019s complete essays . ( 1 ) ( 8 )",

      "In 1947 , Holtzman became a faculty member of the Institute for General Semantics , where he taught with Alfred Korzybski until 1954 . Later he edited the journal Trans/Formation : Arts , Communications , Environment . ( 1 )",
      "Since 1957 , Harry Holtzman , visited the Asian continent documenting its life and culture and gathering an important photographic documentation , relevant both from the artistic and ethnographic point of view . Some of his best photographs relating to the Village Gods of South India were selected by Stella Kramrisch for the catalogue and exhibition Unknown India ritual art in tribe and village ( Philadelphia Museum of Fine Art 1968 ) . The Museum of Modern Art of New York included in 1962 some of his photographs of Le Corbusiers Villa Shodhan in the",
      "circulating exhibition : The Twentieth Century House . ( 1 )",
      "The evolution of the artistic research of Harry Holtzman of these decades led him to illustrate semanticims theory of the interrelation of symbolization and perception in some of his works . The end result of this long research was a series of open reliefs : free standing structures painted to stimulate the visual interchange between the rectilinear solids and the voids as they were shaped by the solids , representing in their interaction the movement and space in viable experience .

      "Liga Veneta Repubblica",
      "Liga Veneta Repubblica ( \u0141iga V\u00e8neta Republica , Venetian Republic League , LVR ) is a Venetist political party in Veneto , Italy . The party maintains a mildly separatist position and campaigns for the self-government of Veneto .",
      "The partys founder and long-time leader is Fabrizio Comencini .",
      "The LVR emerged in 1998 as a split from Liga Veneta ( LV ) , the national section of Lega Nord in Veneto . Originally named Liga Veneta Repubblica , it changed its name to Veneti dEuropa ( after the merger with Future Veneto in 2000 ) and Liga Fronte Veneto ( after the merger with Fronte Marco Polo in 2001 ) . It finally assumed again the original title in 2007 .",
      "In 2000 the party included eight regional councillors , three deputies and four senators ( all LV defectors ) .",
      "History .",
      "Foundation and early years .",
      "In September 1998 , after some clashes with Umberto Bossi , Fabrizio Comencini , national secretary of Liga Veneta ( LV ) since 1994 , tried to lead the party out of Lega Nord ( LN ) , a federation of regional parties . This move was opposed by Bossis loyalists and he was finally expelled from the party and replaced by Gian Paolo Gobbo as leader of the LV .",
      "Subsequently , seven out of eight members of LV\u2013LNs group in the Regional Council of Veneto ( Fabrizio Comencini , Ettore Beggiato , Alessio Morosin , Mariangelo Foggiato , Alberto Poir\u00e8 , Michele Munaretto and Franco Roccon ) left the party and launched Liga Veneta Repubblica ( LVR ) , which was initially intended to be the legal continuation and legitimate heir of the LV . Another councillor , Adriano Bertaso of North-East Union , who had earlier left the LN , joined the party for a while . Comencinis followers represented the more Venetist and separatist wing of the LV , while the people who remained in the LN were mainly fiscal federalists and Padanists . The former were also keen on an alliance with the centre-right Pole of Freedoms coalition in Veneto in support of President Giancarlo Galan , with whom Comencini signed a pact in August 1999 .",
      "Despite the entity of the split among elects , most voters of the LV remained loyal to Gobbo and Bossi . In the 1999 European Parliament election the LVR won 3.5% of the vote in Veneto : a good result for a new party , but far less than the LV , which gained a disappointing 10.7% though , and far less than expected . However , the LVR had some local strongholds : San Bonifacio ( 20.9% over LVs 7.0% in 1998 ) , Schio ( 11.8% over 11.1% in 1999 ) , Arcole ( 44.1% over 6.0% in 1999 ) , Camisano Vicentino ( 21.6% over 5.9% in 1999 ) , Creazzo ( 15.5% over 14.7% in 1999 ) , Chiuppano ( 34.8% and elected mayor in 1999 ) , Monticello Conte Otto ( 14.6% over 7.2% in 1999 ) , Resana ( 24.6% over 7.8% in 1999 ) , Spresiano ( 62.2% over 9.1% and elected mayor in 1999 ) and Torri di Quartesolo ( 15.8% in 1999 ) .",
      "For the 2000 regional election the LV entered an alliance with the Pole of Freedoms that excluded the LVR . The party , whose name was changed to Veneti dEuropa , won 2.4% ( 0.6% under the threshold needed ) , due to the presence of another Venetist party , Fronte Marco Polo ( 1.2% ) , and an electoral recovery of the LV ( 12.0% ) . The name Veneti dEuropa ( Venetians for Europe ) was chosen as the LVR merged with Future Veneto , member of the Autonomists for Europe , a federation of splinter groups from the LN .",
      "Liga Fronte Veneto and split .",
      "In 2001 the party , at the time led by the Venetist historian Beggiato , was merged with Fronte Marco Polo into the new Liga Fronte Veneto . Giorgio Vido was elected national secretary and Comencini national president . In 2001 general election Bepin Segato , a separatist activist in jail for having opposed Italian national unity , was a party candidate for the Senate . Despite gaining more than 5.6% of the votes in Veneto ( mainly disgruntled voters of the LN , after the alliance with Silvio Berlusconis Forza Italia ) and more than 10% in several single-seat constituencies , the party was not able to elect any representative to the Italian Parliament .",
      "In 2003 Beggiato replaced Vido as national secretary in a time when the party was not represented in the institutions and was shrinking in popular support . In 2004 Beggiato tried to lead the party into North-East Project ( PNE ) , even if PNE leader Giorgio Panto wanted LFV members to join not as a party but as individuals . Comencini ruled out the idea , that would have meant giving up the partys identity . After a tumultuous congress , a group led by Beggiato , Foggiato and Munaretto switched to PNE , while Comencini was elected national secretary and Morosin national president .",
      "During this time , the party did occasionally better than the LV in local elections . This was the case of Cittadella in 2002 ( 14.9% over 5.5% ) and San Bonifacio in 2004 ( 17.8% over 4.7% ) : in both cases , LFV candidates , Massimo Bitonci and Silvano Polo respectively , were elected mayors in run-offs . Bitonci , who re-joined the LV , was re-elected in 2007 , while Polo did not stand for re-election and the LFV supported the defeated centre-left candidate .",
      "Decline and more splits .",
      "In the 2005 regional election the party supported the centre-left candidate for president , Massimo Carraro , winning only 1.2% of the vote , while PNE won 5.4% ( 16.1% in the Province of Treviso ) , and being excluded again from the Regional Council . For the 2006 general election Comencini forged an alliance with The Union coalition led by Romano Prodi , but voters seemed to not like the idea and the party stopped at 0.7% .",
      "In the 2007 provincial election of Vicenza the LFV supported Giorgio Carollo , along with parties both from the centre-left and the centre-right : Veneto for the EPP , Italy of Values , UDEUR , Christian Democracy . Carollo scored 9.9% , while the LFV took only 1.6% , compared with 2.3% of PNE and 19.0% of the LV , whose candidate Attilio Schneck was elected President by a landslide . Soon after the election the party returned to its original name , Liga Veneta Repubblica , under which it ran in the 2008 general election .",
      "In October 2008 the LVR signed a coalition pact with North-East Project ( PNE ) and Venetian Agreement ( IV ) for the next municipal , provincial and regional elections in order to provide an adequate representation to the Venetian people , in line with what happens in Europe , from Scotland to Catalonia , from Wales to Brittany , where federalist , autonomist and independentist parties , who respond uniquely to their territory , see their popular support increasing . However , in the 2009 provincial and municipal election the LVR chose to support the candidates of the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats ( UDC ) , having its best result in the Province of Padua ( 1.6% ) .",
      "For the 2010 regional election , after having formed Veneto Freedom ( VL ) with other Venetist parties , the party finally chose to support Antonio De Poli ( UDC ) for President under the banner of North-East Union ( UNE ) , along with UNE , PNE and IV . This decision caused two splits : the more independentist wing , led by Silvano Polo , joined the new Party of the Venetians ( PdV ) and the left-wing minority faction , led by Bortolino Sartore and Giorgio Vido , formed a new party called Liga Veneto Autonomo ( LVA ) in support of Giuseppe Bortolussi , the centre-left candidate . In the election the list won 1.5% of vote , with peaks of 1.9% and 1.8% in the provinces of Treviso and Belluno , and Mariangelo Foggiato ( PNE ) was elected to the Council . The LVA , which was able to present its list only in the Province of Vicenza , one of LVRs strongholds , won 1.1% of the vote there , that is to say a big share of the votes ( 1.6% ) the LVR gained in 2005 .",
      "In the 2013 general election the LVR obtained 0.7% of the vote regionally , 1.2% in its stronghold of Vicenza .",
      "Independence We Veneto .",
      "In July 2013 the LVR joined Let Veneto Decide , a loose cross-party committee for a referendum on Venetos independence ( see Venetian nationalism#Recent developments ) , along with Stefano Valdegamberi ( the regional councillor who presented bill 342/2013 on the referendum ) , Venetian Independence ( IV , the party which had envisioned the campaign ) , Veneto State ( VS ) , Raixe Venete , Veneto First , other Venetist groups and individuals .",
      "In March 2014 the party was a founding member of United for Independent Veneto , a more structured federation of Venetist and separatist parties , including also VS , Independent Venetians ( VI ) and Valdegamberis Popular Future ( FP ) . In July 2014 the coalition was transformed into We Independent Veneto ( NVI ) , after the entry of other parties , notably including North-East Project and Chiavegato for Independence .",
      "After the exit of Chiavegato and his group from the alliance and their alignment with Alessio Morosins IV , the remaining parties of NVI formed a joint list for the 2015 regional election named Independence We Veneto ( INV ) , a sort of re-edition of 2010s North-East Union , but with a separatist platform and in support of Luca Zaia , incumbent President of Veneto and candidate of the LV\u2013LN . In the election , the list won 2.7% of the vote ( 0.2% more than IV ) and Antonio Guadagnini of VS was elected regional councillor in the provincial constituency of Vicenza .",
      "In May 2017 Comencini and other INV leaders were briefly members of Great North ( GN ) , a liberal and federalist party .",
      "Sometime in 2018 Comencini stepped down as secretary , being replaced by Gianluigi Sette and becoming president instead .",
      "In the 2019 local elections the LVR stood with its own lists in San Bonifacio , Negrar and Arzignano .",
      "Back with Liga Veneta .",
      "For the 2020 regional election the party entered in alliance with the LV for the first time since the 1998 split . In the election the LV sponsors three lists , its own , Luca Zaias personal list and the Venetian Autonomy List , whose logo is the LVRs one with minor modifications , especially List instead of Liga and the Autonomy banner in the lower part , along with LVRs acronym . The LVR obtained 2.4% of the vote , electing Tomas Piccinini to the Regional Council .",
      "Popular support .",
      "The electoral results of the party in Veneto in the regional and general elections for the Senate since 1999 are shown in the chart below .",

      "Game Grumps",
      "Game Grumps is a Lets Play web series hosted by Arin Hanson and Dan Avidan . Created in 2012 by co-hosts Hanson and Jon Jafari , the series centers around its hosts playing video games while adding comedic commentary . After Jafari left the show in 2013 to focus on his own YouTube webseries , JonTron , he was succeeded by Avidan . The YouTube channel for Game Grumps currently operates under JETPAK , a network created by Adam Montoya .",
      "Since Jafaris departure , the channel has expanded to include other hosts , besides the main two , who have floated in and out of the channel over time as a part of spin-off shows . Those include Ross ODonovan , Barry Kramer , Suzy Berhow , and Brian Wecht , as well as various guest hosts . , Game Grumps has over 5.39 million subscribers and over 5.7 billion total video views . Game Grumps have also developed and published two of their own video games , and Soviet Jump Game , as well as writing the young adult novel Ghost Hunters Adventure Club and the Secret of the Grande Chateau .",
      "Format .",
      "Episodes usually consist of two hosts or more , playing a video game , featuring their commentary , experience with ( and opinions of ) the chosen game , as well as related and unrelated discussions , along with stories from their lives . Many of the games played on the show are sent in by fans , who mail in games to the Grumps\u2019 PO box in Glendale , California . The channel previously uploaded two or three 10-minute episodes on average each day , but changed to having one longer 30-minute episode each day . Lengthier games often result in ongoing series , which continue airing until completion , unless ending early in favor of beginning a new series . Occasionally , the hosts will participate and compete in multiplayer games , as part of their Game Grumps VS series . Though the episodes usually consist of two or more people , there are some special episodes with Hanson or Avidan alone .",
      "History .",
      "Game Grumps was created by Jon JonTron Jafari and Arin Egoraptor Hanson , and began with a video of the two playing Kirby Super Star uploaded on July 18 , 2012 to video streaming site YouTube . According to Jafari and Hanson , the idea for the show came about when the two were arguing over whether or not the character Wolf from the fighting game Super Smash Bros . Brawl was too similar to the character Fox in terms of their fighting styles . After animator Ross O\u2019Donovan told the duo about their tendency to be \u201cgrumpy\u201d with each other over video games , Hanson came up with the idea of a podcast revolving around this concept , though the show ultimately became a video series on YouTube rather than a podcast . In September 2012 , Barry Kramer was brought onto the show as an editor . Hanson and Jafari worked on the show together until June 25 , 2013 , when Jafari announced he would be leaving the show due to desires to focus on his own show . Many fans were upset by Jafaris departure from Game Grumps , with many expressing disappointment in the decisions last-minute announcement , as well as the channels decision to announce the beginning of Steam Train on the same day . After Jafaris departure , Ninja Sex Party vocalist Dan Avidan succeeded him as co-host of the main show . Avidan also joined animator Ross ODonovan as co-host of the show Steam Train where both play PC games . This expanded the channels output to three videos a day : two standard Game Grumps episodes and a single Steam Train episode . Steam Train later expanded to include Hanson as a co-host at times , as well as featuring one of the groups editors , Barry Kramer , and Hansons wife Suzy Berhow . The expansion also introduced a new Steam Rolled series , where four-player games ( not necessarily PC games ) are played by the group .",
      "In October 2013 , the group began a gameplay series featuring Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the Polaris YouTube channel , titled Hunting Monsters . A second installment , featuring Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate , began in February 2015 .",
      "In December 2013 , Kramer and Berhow began hosting Table Flip , where they dress in Victorian/19th century American period clothing and play tabletop games , such as card games , board games , and tile-based games with other YouTube personalities . The series was professionally produced by Polaris , with seven cameras and extensive editing in post-production to fit the content to the shows 45 to 60 minute format on Polariss website rather than the Game Grumps YouTube channel . The final episode of Table Flip aired on October 14 , 2016 .",
      "In November 2014 , Kevin Abernathy was hired to assist Kramer with video editing and production . Although Abernathy took on editing for most of the series , Kramer continued to edit Steam Train . Since Abernathys departure from the show in mid-2016 , Kramer , Ryan Magee , and Matt Watson have taken on editing duties .",
      "In January 2015 , to celebrate reaching two million subscribers , a new show called Grumpcade was launched , featuring any combination of co-hosts playing console games . The show also features guest YouTube personalities , including game critics ProJared , The Completionist and Markiplier . Shortly after , in February 2015 , GrumpOut , a channel dedicated to recreational and live-action video projects , was created . In November 2015 , Avidans Ninja Sex Party bandmate Brian Wecht officially joined the team , leaving behind his career as a theoretical physicist .",
      "The channel also airs special holiday-themed series , featuring holiday-themed games , including Jingle Grumps and Steam Sleigh for Christmas , Ghoul Grumps and Scream Train for Halloween , Date Grumps , Single Train and Love Train for Valentines Day , and Stout Train for St . Patricks Day .",
      "In February 2016 , it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at Hollywood Improv for a special performance of Game Grumps Live on March 30 and 31 . Later , in April 2016 , it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at Levity Live in Nyack , New York for more performances of Game Grumps Live on April 29 and 30 . Game Grumps Live has since gone on to become a regularly-touring entity , performing across the United States and Canada in brief regional stints at a time .",
      "On January 6 , 2017 , it was announced that the shows middle slot would no longer upload on a consistent schedule . While Steam Train and Grumpcade were not canceled , the format was changed so that they would be released only upon the creators discretion on an occasional basis . A few substitute shows were created to fill the empty slot on certain days . These include Doodle Doods , an artistic show hosted by ODonovan and Chris ONeil , The G Club , a media-centric podcast show , and Dragons in Places , an audio-only podcast detailing a Dungeons & Dragons campaign .",
      "In December 2017 , Kramer announced that he would be departing from the show to focus on his own pursuits . He was replaced by Ryan Magee and Matt Watson .",
      "April 3 , 2018 was the start of the Game Grumps new series 10 Minute Power Hour , which consists of face-cam live footage of the duo Hanson and Avidan being thrown specific tasks or challenges that they have to complete . This series brought in a new editor , Tucker Prescott , whose main focus is recording and editing this series .",
      "On April 18 , 2018 , the shows opening animation was updated .",
      "In May 2019 , all episodes guest starring the YouTuber Jared ProJared Knabenbauer were first made private then deleted entirely , presumably in an effort by the Game Grumps to distance themselves from Knabenbaurer following allegations that he abused his fame to solicit nude photos from underage fans .",
      "Since 2015 , Game Grumps has also been developing an animated series titled Gameoverse , created by ODonovan . By June 21 , 2017 , the development team had expanded to include writer Chad Quandt , concept artist Ashley Swaby , and story artist Krooked_Glasses .",
      "On May 3 , 2019 , Matt Watson and Ryan Magee announced they would be retiring as the editors of Game Grumps content to pursue their own channel , SuperMega . Game Grumps new editor , Benjamin Ben Anderson , replaced them shortly after .",
      "Later in 2019 , Game Grumps launched a spin-off channel titled The Grumps to focus on Hanson and Avidans live-action comedy . The channels current programming consists of 10 Minute Power Hour and a show where Hanson and Avidan answer questions , react to Internet content , and try various activities , called Good Content .",

      "Clarence Cannon",
      "Clarence Andrew Cannon ( April 11 , 1879 \u2013 May 12 , 1964 ) was a Democratic Congressman from Missouri serving from 1923 until his death in Washington , D.C . in 1964 . He was a notable parliamentarian and chaired the U.S . House Committee on Appropriations . He is the longest-serving member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Missouri .",
      "Biography .",
      "Born in Elsberry , Missouri , the son of John Randolph Cannon , a farmer and merchant , and Ida Glovina Whiteside , a descendant of the Kemper family of Missouri and Germanna . Reflecting his familys influence and his rural , border-state background ,",
      "Cannon maintained a lifelong devotion to the Southern Baptist faith and the Democratic party . He also possessed a firm belief in the superiority of the agrarian lifestyle and small-town values . In 1901 , Cannon graduated from La Grange Junior College ( now known as Hannibal-LaGrange College ) in Hannibal , Missouri , from William Jewell College in Liberty , Missouri in 1903 , and from the law school of the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1908 . After working as a high school teacher and principal , he served",
      "as an instructor of history at Stephens College in Columbia , Missouri from 1904 to 1908 . Though he retained a lifelong interest in the American past and wrote several books on family and local history , Cannon deemed the academic life too sedentary . Accordingly , he studied law at the University of Missouri while teaching at Stephens College . He earned an LL.B . and joined the bar in 1908 . He established a law practice in Troy , Missouri , but soon transferred it to his home town of Elsberry .",
      "Cannon was initiated into the Alpha-Omega chapter of the Kappa Sigma fraternity while an undergraduate at William Jewell in 1903 .",
      "In 1906 , Cannon married Ida Dawson Wigginton ; they had two daughters . The couple formed a close working relationship . Ida Cannon became her husbands most trusted political adviser . Starting in the 1920s , she traveled extensively over the back-country roads of northeastern Missouri campaigning for her spouse , while he remained at his congressional desk in Washington , D.C .",
      "Politics .",
      "Cannon eagerly sought elective office , but his first two campaigns , for county school superintendent and state representative , ended in defeat . His political fortunes changed after his congressman , Champ Clark , hired him as a confidential secretary in 1911 . When Democrats elected Clark Speaker of the House that year , Cannon found himself near the center of power in Washington .",
      "Enjoying Clarks patronage , Cannon advanced to the positions of House journal clerk from 1914 to 1917 and House parliamentarian from 1917 to 1920 . A quick study , he rapidly established himself as a leading authority on parliamentary procedure . His skills proved so impressive that the Republicans retained him after winning the House in 1918 . In 1920 he became parliamentarian of the Democratic National Convention , a position he held through 1960 . Cannon exercised lasting influence over the workings of Congress through publications such as Procedure in the House of Representatives ( 1920 ) and Cannons Precedents of the House of Representatives ( 1936 ) . After resigning as House parliamentarian , Cannon returned to his law practice in Elsberry .",
      "Clark was defeated by Republican Theodore W . Hukriede in the 1920 Republican landslide . Cannon challenged Hukriede for his mentors seat in the House of Representatives in 1922 and won . Popular with his constituents , he repeatedly won reelection , often without opposition , until his death .",
      "Years in Congress .",
      "Heeding the concerns of his rural district , Cannon emerged as a leading advocate of agricultural interests . He supported parity payments to maintain farmers incomes , low-interest federal farm loans , and soil conservation and flood control projects . The latter two were of special concern in Cannons district , and one of the congressmans most enduring legacies involved securing federal funding for what eventually became the Clarence Cannon Dam and Reservoir in northeastern Missouri . Cannon also played a major role in the establishment of the rural electrification program and in obtaining government funds for agricultural research . No farm legislation was approved by Congress during the Cannon years , a contemporary observer noted , that did not bear the impress of Cannons knowledge of parliamentary procedure and his influence in Congress .",
      "With the notable exception of farm supports , the Missourian primarily gained a reputation as a budget-slashing fiscal conservative , especially after he became chair of the House Appropriations Committee in 1941 . Cannon retained this powerful position , except for four years of Republican control , until his death . He urged a quick reduction in military expenditures immediately after World War II , denounced foreign aid as waste , and ridiculed the space program as moondoggle ( the word had been coined by Norbert Wiener ) . Cannons desire to hold tight the nations purse strings grew with the years . In 1962 , he bitterly denounced the first $100-billion Congress in a much-publicized speech on the House floor , angering House Speaker John W . McCormack and other fellow Democrats .",
      "Always outspoken , sometimes irascible , Cannon earned a reputation for pugnacity . He once lampooned a fellow House member , Of all the piddlin politicians that ever piddled piddlin politics on this floor , my esteemed friend , the gentleman from Wisconsin , is the greatest piddler that ever piddled . During an argument in 1945 , Cannon punched in the face Representative John Taber of New York , the ranking Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee . Cannon noted gleefully that Taber ran out of the room with a bleeding lip . In 1962 , Cannon engaged in an unseemly and well-publicized dispute with U.S . Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona , another octogenarian Democrat , over obscure matters of parliamentary precedent .",
      "In 1955 , Cannon bypassed several more senior Democrats to appoint Otto Passman of Monroe , Louisiana , as the chairman of the pivotal House Foreign Operations Subcommittee , with jurisdiction over foreign aid . A long-term critic of most foreign-aid expenditures , Passman said at a meeting at the Eisenhower White House that never in the history of the world has the mind of man conceived such an unreasonable and unworkable program as foreign aid .",
      "Cannon did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto , and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 , 1960 , and 1964 , but voted present on the 24th Amendment to the U.S . Constitution .",
      "Cannons irascibility extended beyond the halls of Congress . In January 1964 , Jacqueline Kennedy wrote to him expressing her appreciation for his help in establishing the John F . Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts , adding , I know the fight was not easy . Cannon retorted to the recently widowed first lady : You say the fight was not easy , but on the contrary , we had cooperation from everyone . It was done practically by acclamation .",
      "Death .",
      "Cannon died of heart failure at the Washington Hospital Center in Washington , D.C . He had already announced his intention to seek reelection later in the year .",
      "His lengthy service in Congress made him an influential if somewhat contradictory representative . During his 41-year congressional career , he served well his rural Missouri constituents , securing passage of farm supports and funding for local projects that some critics denounced as pork barrel politics . At the same time , he advocated stricter fiscal responsibility in other branches of the federal government . Beyond the scope of legislation , Cannons publications on congressional procedure have achieved the status of holy writ for successive generations of lawmakers . His contributions to agricultural and appropriation policies and parliamentary procedure , enhanced by his colorful personality , have ensured him a place as one of the major congressional figures of the twentieth century .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Cannon was the author of A Synopsis of the Procedure of the House ( 1918 ) , Procedure in the House of Representatives ( 1920 ) , and Cannon\u2019s Procedure ( 1928 ) , subsequent editions of the latter being published periodically by resolutions of the House until 1963 . He was the editor and compiler of Precedents of the House of Representatives ( Cannons Precedents ) by an act of Congress . He also served as regent of the Smithsonian Institution from 1935 to 1964 . He is interred in Elsberry City Cemetery , Elsberry , Missouri . The Clarence Cannon Dam , in Ralls County , Missouri , creating Mark Twain Lake , is named in his honor due to his involvement in securing funding for the dams construction . For several years the airport in Kirksville , Missouri was known as Clarence Cannon Memorial Airport . However , in the 1980s the name was changed to Kirksville Regional Airport . The terminal is still known as the Clarence Cannon terminal in honor of his role in securing and maintaining commercial air service to Kirksville . A high school athletic conference that serves much of his former district is known as the Clarence Cannon Conference .",
      "A National Wildlife Refuge near Annada , Missouri also bears his name : the Clarence Cannon National Wildlife Refuge ."

      "The Embassy of Canada in Washington , D.C . ( ) is Canadas main diplomatic mission to the United States . The embassy building is located at 501 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest , Washington , D.C. , between the United States Capitol and the White House , just north of the National Gallery of Art . In addition to its diplomatic role , the embassy provides consular services for Delaware , Washington , D.C. , Maryland , Virginia , and West Virginia . It also hosts a Trade Commissioner Service office , which has Maryland , Washington , D.C. , Virginia , and West Virginia as its responsibilities .",
      "History .",
      "The Embassy of Canada was originally located at 1746 Massachusetts Avenue NW on Embassy Row , in a house that had been purchased in 1927 from the widow of Clarence Moore , a financier who died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic . The location subsequently became the Embassy of Uzbekistan .",
      "By 1969 , the chancery had spread across three buildings and could not accommodate additional staff . At the same time , the federally chartered Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation was looking to revitalize the avenue . In 1978 , the Canadian government purchased a vacant lot on Pennsylvania Avenue NW for $5 million . The site had been a Ford dealership ( built in 1916 by Irwin and Leighton as Ford Service Building ) and a public library . The six floor building was demolished before it was purchased by the Government of Canada .",
      "The embassy building was officially opened by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on May 3 , 1989 . The building houses approximately 265 Canadian diplomatic and locally engaged staff . The embassy houses representatives from two provinces ( Ontario and Alberta ) and 13 Canadian federal government agencies , including Foreign Affairs , International Trade and Development Canada , Industry Canada , Transport Canada , Public Works and Government Services Canada , the Department of National Defence , the Permanent Mission of Canada to the Organization of American States , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , amongst others . Additionally , the Government of Quebecs Ministry of International Relations and La Francophonie has operated a bureau in Washington since 1978 ; it is located near McPherson Square .",
      "Canada has the embassy closest to the Capitol Building and is the only country to have its embassy along the presidential inaugural route between the Capitol Building and the White House . The Washington bureau of the Fox News Channel is a short distance away \u2014 its studio is positioned such that the flag of Canada at the embassy is visible during many broadcasts , through the window which serves as the anchor desks backdrop .",
      "The Embassy of Canada hosts numerous events throughout the year for visiting ministers as well as for a wide range of diplomatic , military , and public functions .",
      "Architecture .",
      "The Pennsylvania Avenue NW building was designed by British Columbias Arthur Erickson , recognized as one of Canadas most decorated architects . Erickson tried to evoke a sense of Canada in the architecture of the building , using long horizontals , wide open spaces and water features . The large airy courtyard includes the sculpture Spirit of Haida Gwaii by Bill Reid , featured on Canadas twenty-dollar bill from 2004 to 2012 , which sits in a pool of water representative of Canadas ocean limits .",
      "The Rotunda of the Provinces on the courtyards southeast corner has a domed roof that is supported by 12 pillars , each featuring one of the crests of the ten provinces and two territories in existence at the time of the embassys construction . The seal above the rotundas entranceway represents the territory of Nunavut , which was established in April 1999 . The rotunda is also an echo chamber ; noise is reflected and focused back , though this magnified volume is only appreciated by the person at the rotundas centre . Surrounding the rotunda is a waterfall , incorporated by the architect to represent Niagara Falls , the most famous site along the Canada\u2013U.S . border .",
      "In the words of former U.S . Secretary of State James Baker , I think just as diplomats represent their country , people and interest to the world , so too an embassy chancery displays its countrys face to the world\u2026This bold and dramatic building , the new Chancery of Canada does that . Monumental in its appearance , it also I think conveys the warmth and the openness of the people of Canada . Your new home here in the centre of our new capital [ is ] along an avenue which is steeped in the history of American democracy between the White House and the Congress .",
      "Artwork .",
      "The Embassy of Canada has four collections on display : the Foreign Affairs Fine Art Collection ( a permanent collection at the embassy ) , the Canada Council Art Bank , the Imperial Oil collection and the Scotiabank Corporate Art collection . The embassy also currently has several arctic-themed works that are on loan from TD Bank , in honour of Canadas 2013\u20132015 chairship of the Arctic Council . The Foreign Affairs Fine Art Collection contains Canadian art for use in Embassies and Official Residences abroad . By displaying Canadian art in this manner , the collection assists in the promotion of Canadian culture abroad .",
      "The Canada Council Art Bank is a collection of Canadian art that is loaned to Canadian government departments , agencies and private sector corporations .",
      "Imperial Oil has lent the embassy 10 works from their corporate collection , providing a regional perspective of Canadian art . Of particular note are the works Heart of the Forest by Emily Carr and the Group of Sevens , A.J . Cassons piece Morning near Whitefish Falls .",
      "The Scotiabank Corporate art collection is one of the leading corporate art collections in Canada , consisting of significant works of art by renowned Canadian contemporary artists . This includes photography by Edward Burtynsky and Geoffrey James and a silkscreen on paper by Christopher Pratt .",
      "The embassy also has a small gallery set just off of the main foyer that showcases Canadian artists or Canada-themed exhibits . In September 2014 , the gallery hosted a special exhibit honouring the embassys 25th anniversary .",
      "Ambassador .",
      "Canadas 24th Ambassador to the United States was David MacNaughton , who presented his credentials to President Barack Obama on March 3 , 2016 . MacNaughton previously served as Canadian and North American president of Hill and Knowlton , and president of Public Affairs International , which purchased Decima Research to create Public Affairs Resource Group .",
      "MacNaughton left the post at the end of August 2019 , and was replaced by Acting Ambassador of Canada to the United States Kirsten Hillman .",

      "Albuquerque Dukes",
      "The Albuquerque Dukes were a minor league baseball team based in Albuquerque , New Mexico .",
      "History .",
      "The first Dukes team was formed in 1915 as part of the Class D Rio Grande Association . The team finished in third place with a 32-25 record . Frank Huelman was the league leader in home runs , hitting 10 dingers for the season . These Dukes folded that same year .",
      "Albuquerque was host to two other Class D minor-league teams ( the Dons and the Albuquerque Cardinals , the latter for which Tingley Field was built ) before the Dukes returned in 1942 , this time with the Class D West Texas\u2013New Mexico League . The Dukes went 24-30 , but withdrew from competition in June of that year . The league was silent from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II , but play resumed in 1946 with the Dukes returning to the league , which was reclassified as Class C . In 1955 the West Texas\u2013New Mexico League stepped up one more level , to Class B .",
      "In 1956 the Dukes began play in the Class A Western League as an affiliate of the New York Giants ( now San Francisco Giants ) . In 1958 they switched to being the Cincinnati Reds affiliate , but the Western League folded at the end of the season . The Dukes returned to Albuquerque in 1960 , playing as an affiliate for the Kansas City Athletics ( now Oakland Athletics ) in the Class D Sophomore League .",
      "Double-A .",
      "In 1962 Kansas City management moved the team to the Double-A Texas League , but dropped the team at the end of the season . The Los Angeles Dodgers began what would be a 47-year relationship with the club in 1963 , and changed the name to the Albuquerque Dodgers in 1965 .",
      "In 1969 , the team moved from Tingley Field to the Albuquerque Sports Stadium , a fully modern facility on the south edge of town , near the UNM area .",
      "Triple-A .",
      "In 1972 , the Dukes name was revived and the team moved up to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League . The Dodgers transferred the Spokane Indians to Albuquerque after the 1971 season . Ironically , that franchise was a charter member of the PCL in 1903 as the original Los Angeles Angels , who had been displaced by the Dodgers in 1958 to spend the next 14 years in Spokane .",
      "With future Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda at the helm , the Dukes amassed a 92-58 record and won the PCL championship , the first of eight for the franchise . That 1972 team , featuring future big leaguers Charlie Hough , Davey Lopes , Ron Cey , Larry Hisle , Tom Paciorek , and Von Joshua ( among others ) . Much of that team , including Lasorda , helped the Dodgers win pennants in 1977 , 1978 and 1981 , and a World Series in 1981 .",
      "The 1981 club , powered by sluggers Mike Marshall and Candy Maldonado and managed by Del Crandall , was also a dominant team , winning both halves of the South Division with a 94-38 record and sweeping the Tacoma Rainiers to win their third league title . Their .712 winning percentage was the second-best in PCL history at the time . The 1981 Dukes were recognized as the eleventh best minor league baseball team of all time , and the only team in the top 20 to play after 1943 . During that season , KTLA , a Los Angeles-area television station , broadcast several games live from Albuquerque Sports Stadium during the players strike that disrupted the season . The station even brought along Don Drysdale to be the announcer . In addition , when the 1981 players strike ended , the Dukes played an exhibition game against the Dodgers at Dodger stadium as a tune-up for the Dodgers , the Dukes won the game 1-0 . The game was televised in Albuquerque on KNAT-TV23 .",
      "In the early 1990s , future stars such as Mike Piazza , Pedro Mart\u00ednez , John Wetteland , Ra\u00fal Mondes\u00ed , Paul Konerko , and many more came through on their way to The Show . The team won PCL titles in 1990 and 94 , and posted the PCLs best overall record in 1991 .",
      "By then , however , the Dukes were growing dissatisfied with their longtime home , Albuquerque Sports Stadium . It was the oldest facility in the PCL , and was increasingly in disrepair .",
      "In 2000 , the Lozinak family , absentee owners who resided in Maryland , sold the franchise to an interest group in Portland , Oregon . Following that season , the Dukes were moved and renamed the Portland Beavers . The Dodgers traded Triple-A franchises with the San Diego Padres , who had the Las Vegas Stars franchise as an affiliate , but who had a history in Portland . San Diego took over the Beavers/Dukes , and Los Angeles took Las Vegas , renaming the team the Las Vegas 51s for the famed alleged UFO spaceport , Area 51 , near Las Vegas .",
      "Team name and logo .",
      "The Dukes logo depicted a smiling cartoon version of a Spanish conquistador . That , and the team name reflecting Spanish nobility , likely reflect New Mexicos history as the earliest center of Spanish colonization in the present-day United States .",
      "It is generally believed that the city of Albuquerque was named in honor of Don Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cueva , viceroy of New Spain from 1653 to 1660 . One of de la Cuevas aristocratic titles was Duke of Alburquerque , referring to the Spanish town of Alburquerque . Thus , the moniker Dukes commemorated the original Duke of Alburquerque , for whom the city of Albuquerque is named .",
      "Notable players .",
      "Among the well-known players to have served with the Dukes are Mike Piazza , Paul Konerko , Pedro Mart\u00ednez , Orel Hershiser , Kirk Gibson ( on major league rehab assignment ) , Mike Marshall , John Wetteland , Darryl Strawberry ( on major league rehab assignment ) , Eric Karros , Mike Maddux , Ra\u00fal Mondes\u00ed , Chan Ho Park , Mike Scioscia , Dave Stewart , Rick Sutcliffe , Fernando Valenzuela , Jos\u00e9 Vizca\u00edno , Sid Bream , Rick Rhoden , Steve Sax , Greg Gagne , Eric Young , Mickey Hatcher , Tim Wallach ( on major league rehab assignment ) , Davey Lopes , Steve Yeager , Tom Paciorek , Jos\u00e9 Offerman , Larry Hisle , \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 , Todd Hollandsworth , and Paul Lo Duca . One of the most popular players in Dukes history was Brian Traxler , who only played 14 games in the major leagues . In 1954 , Albuquerque native and future United States Senator Peter V . Domenici earned an education degree at New Mexico State University and signed on with the Dukes for whom he pitched for one year .",
      "Among the managers of the Dukes were Lasorda , Del Crandall , Bill Russell , Kevin Kennedy , Rick Dempsey , Terry Collins and Mike Scioscia .",
      "Replacement .",
      "When the Dukes left Albuquerque in 2000 , no replacement team had been found . In 2003 , the Calgary Cannons were moved to Albuquerque as the Albuquerque Isotopes , a Triple-A affiliate of the Florida Marlins at the time . In 2009 , the Isotopes became an affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers , reuniting Albuquerques relationship with the Dodgers .",
      "The Isotopes play at Isotopes Park , the completely renovated stadium that now stands at the site of the Dukes former home field , Albuquerque Sports Stadium . This award-winning stadium opened in 2003 and is shared with the University of New Mexico Lobos baseball team , hosting approximately 100 home games each year , as well as New Mexico United soccer team",

      "Veliky Novgorod",
      "Veliky Novgorod ( ) , also known as Novgorod the Great , or Novgorod Veliky , or just Novgorod ( meaning newtown ) , is one of the oldest historic cities of Russia , with more than 1,000 years of history . The city serves as the administrative center of Novgorod Oblast . The city lies along the Volkhov River just downstream from its outflow from Lake Ilmen and is situated on the M10 federal highway connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg . UNESCO recognized Novgorod as a World Heritage Site in 1992 . The city has a population of",
      "At its peak during the 14th century , the city was the capital of the Novgorod Republic and was one of Europes largest cities . The Veliky ( great ) part was eventually added to the citys name to differentiate it from another city with a similar name , Nizhny Novgorod ( lower newtown ) .",
      "History .",
      "Early developments .",
      "The Sofia First Chronicle makes initial mention of it in 859 , while the Novgorod First Chronicle first mentions it in 862 , when it was purportedly already a major Baltics-to-Byzantium station on the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks . The Charter of Veliky Novgorod recognizes 859 as the year when the city was first mentioned . Novgorod is traditionally considered to be a cradle of Russian statehood .",
      "The oldest archaeological excavations in the middle to late 20th century , however , have found cultural layers dating back to the late 10th century , the time of the Christianization of Rus and a century after it was allegedly founded . Archaeological dating is fairly easy and accurate to within 15\u201325 years , as the streets were paved with wood , and most of the houses made of wood , allowing tree ring dating .",
      "The Varangian name of the city or ( or ) is mentioned in Norse Sagas as existing at a yet earlier stage , but the correlation of this reference with the actual city is uncertain . Originally , referred to the stronghold , now only to the south of the center of the present-day city , Rurikovo Gorodische ( named in comparatively modern times after the Varangian chieftain Rurik , who supposedly made it his capital around 860 ) . Archaeological data suggests that the Gorodishche , the residence of the Knyaz ( prince ) , dates from the mid-9th century , whereas the town itself dates only from the end of the 10th century ; hence the name Novgorod , new city , from Old Church Slavonic and ( and ) , although German and Scandinavian historiography suggests the Old Norse term , or the Old High German term . First mention of this Nordic or Germanic etymology to the name of the city of Novgorod ( and that of other cities within the territory of the then Kievan Rus ) occurs in the 10th-century policy manual by Byzantine emperor Constantine VII .",
      "Slightly predating the chronology of the legend of Rurik ( which dates the first Norse arrival in the region around 858\u2013860 ) , an earlier record for the Scandinavian settlement of the region is found in the ( written up until 882 ) where a Rus delegation is mentioned as having visited Constantinople in 838 and , intending to return to the Rus Khaganate via the Baltic Sea , were questioned by Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious at , where they said that although their origin was Swedish , they had settled in Northern Rus under a leader whom they designated as ( the Latin form of Khagan , a title they had likely borrowed from contact with the Avars ) .",
      "Princely state within Kievan Rus .",
      "In 882 , Ruriks successor , Oleg of Novgorod , conquered Kiev and founded the state of Kievan Rus . Novgorods size as well as its political , economic , and cultural influence made it the second most important city in Kievan Rus . According to a custom , the elder son and heir of the ruling Kievan monarch was sent to rule Novgorod even as a minor . When the ruling monarch had no such son , Novgorod was governed by posadniks , such as the legendary Gostomysl , Dobrynya , Konstantin , and Ostromir .",
      "Of all their princes , Novgorodians most cherished the memory of Yaroslav the Wise , who sat as Prince of Novgorod from 1010 to 1019 , while his father , Vladimir the Great , was a prince in Kiev . Yaroslav promulgated the first written code of laws ( later incorporated into Russkaya Pravda ) among the Eastern Slavs and is said to have granted the city a number of freedoms or privileges , which they often referred to in later centuries as precedents in their relations with other princes . His son , Vladimir , sponsored construction of the great St . Sophia Cathedral , more accurately translated as the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom , which stands to this day .",
      "Early foreign ties .",
      "In Norse sagas the city is mentioned as the capital of Gardariki . Four Viking kings\u2014Olaf I of Norway , Olaf II of Norway , Magnus I of Norway , and Harald Hardrada\u2014sought refuge in Novgorod from enemies at home . No more than a few decades after the 1030 death and subsequent canonization of Olaf II of Norway , the citys community had erected in his memory Saint Olafs Church in Novgorod .",
      "The Gotland town of Visby functioned as the leading trading center in the Baltic before the Hansa League . At Novgorod in 1080 , Visby merchants established a trading post which they named Gutagard ( also known as Gotenhof ) . Later , in the first half of the 13th century , merchants from northern Germany also established their own trading station in Novgorod , known as Peterhof . At about the same time , in 1229 , German merchants at Novgorod were granted certain privileges , which made their position more secure .",
      "Novgorod Republic .",
      "In 1136 , the Novgorodians dismissed their prince Vsevolod Mstislavich . The year is seen as the traditional beginning of the Novgorod Republic . The city was able to invite and dismiss a number of princes over the next two centuries , but the princely office was never abolished and powerful princes , such as Alexander Nevsky , could assert their will in the city regardless of what Novgorodians said . The city state controlled most of Europes northeast , from lands east of todays Estonia to the Ural Mountains , making it one of the largest states in medieval Europe , although much of the territory north and east of Lakes Ladoga and Onega was sparsely populated and never organized politically .",
      "One of the most important local figures in Novgorod was the posadnik , or mayor , an official elected by the public assembly ( called the Veche ) from among the citys boyars , or aristocracy . The tysyatsky , or thousandman , originally the head of the town militia but later a commercial and judicial official , was also elected by the Veche . Another important local official was the Archbishop of Novgorod who shared power with the boyars . Archbishops were elected by the Veche or by the drawing of lots , and after their election , were sent to the metropolitan for consecration .",
      "While a basic outline of the various officials and the Veche can be drawn up , the city-states exact political constitution remains unknown . The boyars and the archbishop ruled the city together , although where one officials power ended and anothers began is uncertain . The prince , although his power was reduced from around the middle of the 12th century , was represented by his namestnik , or lieutenant , and still played important roles as a military commander , legislator and jurist . The exact composition of the Veche , too , is uncertain , with some historians , such as Vasily Klyuchevsky , claiming it was democratic in nature , while later scholars , such as Marxists Valentin Ianin and Aleksandr Khoroshev , see it as a sham democracy controlled by the ruling elite .",
      "In the 13th century , Novgorod , while not a member of the Hanseatic League , was the easternmost kontor , or entrep\u00f4t , of the league , being the source of enormous quantities of luxury ( sable , ermine , fox , marmot ) and non-luxury furs ( squirrel pelts ) .",
      "Throughout the Middle Ages , the city thrived culturally . A large number of birch bark letters have been unearthed in excavations , perhaps suggesting widespread literacy . It was in Novgorod that the Novgorod Codex , the oldest Slavic book written north of Bulgaria , and the oldest inscription in a Finnic language ( Birch bark letter no . 292 ) were unearthed . Some of the most ancient Russian chronicles ( Novgorod First Chronicle ) were written in the scriptorium of the archbishops who also promoted iconography and patronized church construction . The Novgorod merchant Sadko became a popular hero of Russian folklore .",
      "Novgorod was never conquered by the Mongols during the Mongol invasion of Rus . The Mongol army turned back about from the city , not because of the citys strength , but probably because the Mongol commanders did not want to get bogged down in the marshlands surrounding the city . However , the grand princes of Moscow , who acted as tax collectors for the khans of the Golden Horde , did collect tribute in Novgorod , most notably Yury Danilovich and his brother , Ivan Kalita .",
      "In 1259 , Mongol tax-collectors and census-takers arrived in the city , leading to political disturbances and forcing Alexander Nevsky to punish a number of town officials ( he cut off their noses ) for defying him as Grand Prince of Vladimir ( soon to be the khans tax-collector in Russia ) and his Mongol overlords . In the 14th century , raids by Novgorod pirates , or ushkuiniki , sowed fear as far as Kazan and Astrakhan , assisting Novgorod in wars with the Grand Duchy of Moscow .",
      "During the era of Old Rus State , Novgorod was a trade hub at the northern end of both the Volga trade route and the route from the Varangians to the Greeks along the Dnieper river system . A vast array of goods were transported along these routes and exchanged with local Novgorod merchants and other traders . The farmers of Gotland retained the Saint Olof trading house well into the 12th century . Later German merchantmen also established tradinghouses in Novgorod . Scandinavian royalty would intermarry with Russian princes and princesses .",
      "After the great schism , Novgorod struggled from the beginning of the 13th century against Swedish , Danish , and German crusaders . During the Swedish-Novgorodian Wars , the Swedes invaded lands where some of the population had earlier paid tribute to Novgorod . The Germans had been trying to conquer the Baltic region since the late 12th century . Novgorod went to war 26 times with Sweden and 11 times with the Livonian Brothers of the Sword . The German knights , along with Danish and Swedish feudal lords , launched a series of uncoordinated attacks in 1240\u20131242 . Novgorodian sources mention that a Swedish army was defeated in the Battle of the Neva in 1240 . The Baltic German campaigns ended in failure after the Battle on the Ice in 1242 . After the foundation of the castle of Viborg in 1293 the Swedes gained a foothold in Karelia . On August 12 , 1323 , Sweden and Novgorod signed the Treaty of N\u00f6teborg , regulating their border for the first time .",
      "The citys downfall occurred partially as a result of its inability to feed its large population , making it dependent on the Vladimir-Suzdal region for grain . The main cities in the area , Moscow and Tver , used this dependence to gain control over Novgorod . Eventually Ivan III forcibly annexed the city to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1478 . The Veche was dissolved and a significant part of Novgorods aristocracy , merchants and smaller landholding families was deported to central Russia . The Hanseatic League kontor was closed in 1494 and the goods stored there were seized by Muscovite forces .",
      "Tsardom of Russia .",
      "At the time of annexation , Novgorod became the third largest city under Muscovy and then the Tsardom of Russia ( with 5,300 homesteads and 25\u201330 thousand inhabitants in the 1550s ) and remained so until the famine of the 1560s and the Massacre of Novgorod in 1570 . In the Massacre , Ivan the Terrible sacked the city , slaughtered thousands of its inhabitants , and deported the citys merchant elite and nobility to Moscow , Yaroslavl and elsewhere . The last decade of the 16th century was a comparatively favorable period for the city as Boris Godunov restored trade privileges and raised the status of Novgorod bishop . The German trading post was reestablished in 1603 . Even after the incorporation into the Russian state Novgorod land retained its distinct identity and institutions , including the customs policy and administrative division . Certain elective offices were quickly restored after having been abolished by Ivan III .",
      "During the Time of Troubles , Novgorodians submitted to Swedish troops led by Jacob De la Gardie in the summer of 1611 . The city was restituted to Muscovy six years later by the Treaty of Stolbovo . The conflict led to further depopulation : the number of homesteads in the city decreased from 1158 in 1607 to only 493 in 1617 , with the Sofia side described as deserted . Novgorod only regained a measure of its former prosperity towards the end of the century , when such ambitious buildings as the Cathedral of the Sign and the Vyazhischi Monastery were constructed . The most famous of Muscovite patriarchs , Nikon , was active in Novgorod between 1648 and 1652 . The Novgorod Land became one of the Old Believers strongholds after the Schism . The city remained an important trade centre even though it was now eclipsed by Archangelsk , Novgorodian merchants were trading in the Baltic cities and Stockholm while Swedish merchants came to Novgorod where they had their own trading post since 1627 . Novgorod continued to be a major centre of crafts which employed the majority of its population . There were more than 200 distinct professions in 16th century . Bells , cannons and other arms were produced in Novgorod ; its silversmiths were famous for the skan technique used for religious items and jewellery . Novgorod chests were in widespread use all across Russia , including the Tsars household and the northern monasteries .",
      "Russian Empire .",
      "In 1727 , Novgorod was made the administrative center of Novgorod Governorate of the Russian Empire , which was detached from Saint Petersburg Governorate ( see Administrative divisions of Russia in 1727\u20131728 ) . This administrative division existed until 1927 . Between 1927 and 1944 , the city was a part of Leningrad Oblast , and then became the administrative center of the newly formed Novgorod Oblast .",
      "Modern era .",
      "On August 15 , 1941 , during World War II , the city was occupied by the German Army . Its historic monuments were systematically obliterated . The Red Army the city on January 19 , 1944 . Out of 2,536 stone buildings , fewer than forty remained standing . After the war , thanks to plans laid down by Alexey Shchusev , the central part was gradually restored . In 1992 , the chief monuments of the city and the surrounding area were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list as the Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings . In 1999 , the city was officially renamed Veliky Novgorod ( literally , Great Novgorod ) , thus partly reverting to its medieval title Lord Novgorod the Great . This reduced the temptation to confuse Veliky Novgorod with Nizhny Novgorod , a larger city the other side of Moscow which , between 1932 and 1990 , had been renamed Gorky , in honor of Maxim Gorky .",
      "Administrative and municipal status .",
      "Veliky Novgorod is the administrative center of the oblast and , within the framework of administrative divisions , it also serves as the administrative center of Novgorodsky District , even though it is not a part of it . As an administrative division , it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Veliky Novgorod\u2014an administrative unit with status equal to that of the districts . As a municipal division , the city of oblast significance of Veliky Novgorod is incorporated as Veliky Novgorod Urban Okrug .",
      "Sights .",
      "The city is known for the variety and age of its medieval monuments . The foremost among these is the St . Sophia Cathedral , built between 1045 and 1050 under the patronage of Vladimir Yaroslavich , the son of Yaroslav the Wise ; Vladimir and his mother , Anna Porphyrogenita , are buried in the cathedral . It is one of the best preserved churches from the 11th century . It is also probably the oldest structure still in use in Russia and the first one to represent original features of Russian architecture ( austere stone walls , five helmet-like domes ) . Its frescoes were painted in the 12th century originally on the orders of Bishop Nikita ( died 1108 ) ( the porches or side chapels were painted in 1144 under Archbishop Nifont ) and renovated several times over the centuries , most recently in the nineteenth century . The cathedral features famous bronze gates , which now hang in the west entrance , allegedly made in Magdeburg in 1156 ( other sources see them originating from P\u0142ock in Poland ) and reportedly snatched by Novgorodians from the Swedish town of Sigtuna in 1187 . More recent scholarship has determined that the gates were most likely purchased in the mid-15th century , apparently at the behest of Archbishop Euthymius II ( 1429\u20131458 ) , a lover of Western art and architectural styles .",
      "The Novgorod Kremlin , traditionally known as the Detinets , also contains the oldest palace in Russia ( the so-called Chamber of the Facets , 1433 ) , which served as the main meeting hall of the archbishops ; the oldest Russian bell tower ( mid-15th century ) , and the oldest Russian clock tower ( 1673 ) . The Palace of Facets , the bell tower , and the clock tower were originally built on the orders of Archbishop Euphimius II , although the clock tower collapsed in the 17th century and had to be rebuilt and much of the palace of Euphimius II is no longer standing . Among later structures , the most remarkable are a royal palace ( 1771 ) and a bronze monument to the Millennium of Russia , representing the most important figures from the countrys history ( unveiled in 1862 ) .",
      "Outside the Kremlin walls , there are three large churches constructed during the reign of Mstislav the Great . St . Nicholas Cathedral ( 1113\u20131123 ) , containing frescoes of Mstislavs family , graces Yaroslavs Court ( formerly the chief square of Novgorod ) . The Yuriev Monastery ( one of the oldest in Russia , 1030 ) contains a tall , three-domed cathedral from 1119 ( built by Mstislavs son , Vsevolod , and Kyurik , the head of the monastery ) . A similar three-domed cathedral ( 1117 ) , probably designed by the same masters , stands in the Antoniev Monastery , built on the orders of Antony , the founder of that monastery .",
      "There are now some fifty medieval and early modern churches scattered throughout the city and its surrounding areas . Some of them were blown up by the Nazis and subsequently restored . The most ancient pattern is represented by those dedicated to Saints Pyotr and Pavel ( on the Swallows Hill , 1185\u20131192 ) , to Annunciation ( in Myachino , 1179 ) , to Assumption ( on Volotovo Field , 1180s ) and to St . Paraskeva-Piatnitsa ( at Yaroslavs Court , 1207 ) . The greatest masterpiece of early Novgorod architecture is the Savior church at Nereditsa ( 1198 ) .",
      "In the 13th century , tiny churches of the three-paddled design were in vogue . These are represented by a small chapel at the Peryn Monastery ( 1230s ) and St . Nicholas on the Lipnya Islet ( 1292 , also notable for its 14th-century frescoes ) . The next century saw the development of two original church designs , one of them culminating in ( 1360\u20131361 , fine frescoes from 1380s ) , and another one leading to the Savior church on Ilyina street ( 1374 , painted in 1378 by Feofan Grek ) . The Savior church in Kovalevo ( 1345 ) was originally frescoed by Serbian masters , but the church was destroyed during the war . While the church has since been rebuilt , the frescoes have not been restored .",
      "During the last century of the republican government , some new churches were consecrated to Saints Peter and Paul ( on Slavna , 1367 ; in Kozhevniki , 1406 ) , to Christs Nativity ( at the Cemetery , 1387 ) , to St . John the Apostles ( 1384 ) , to the Twelve Apostles ( 1455 ) , to St Demetrius ( 1467 ) , to St . Simeon ( 1462 ) , and other saints . Generally , they are not thought to be as innovative as the churches from the previous period . Several shrines from the 12th century ( i.e. , in Opoki ) were demolished brick by brick and then reconstructed exactly as they used to be , several of them in the mid-fifteenth century , again under Archbishop Yevfimy II ( Euthymius II ) , perhaps one of the greatest patrons of architecture in medieval Novgorod .",
      "Novgorods conquest by Ivan III in 1478 decisively changed the character of local architecture . Large commissions were thenceforth executed by Muscovite masters and patterned after cathedrals of Moscow Kremlin : e.g. , the Savior Cathedral of Khutyn Monastery ( 1515 ) , the Cathedral of the Mother of God of the Sign ( 1688 ) , the St . Nicholas Cathedral of Vyaschizhy Monastery ( 1685 ) . Nevertheless , the styles of some parochial churches were still in keeping with local traditions : e.g. , the churches of Myrrh-bearing Women ( 1510 ) and of Saints Boris and Gleb ( 1586 ) .",
      "In Vitoslavlitsy , along the Volkhov River and the Myachino Lake , close to the Yuriev Monastery , a museum of wooden architecture was established in 1964 . Over twenty wooden buildings ( churches , houses and mills ) dating from the 14th to the 19th century were transported there from all around the Novgorod region .",
      "11400 graves of the German 1st Luftwaffe Field Division are found at the war cemetery in Novgorod . Also 1900 soldiers of the Spanish Blue Division are buried there .",
      "Transportation .",
      "Intercity transport .",
      "Novgorod has connections to Moscow ( 531 km ) and St . Petersburg ( 189 km ) by the federal highway M10 . There are public buses to Saint Petersburg and other destinations .",
      "The city has direct railway passenger connections with Moscow ( Leningradsky Rail Terminal , by night trains ) , St . Petersburg ( Moscow Rail Terminal and Vitebsk Rail Terminal , by suburban trains ) , Minsk ( Belarus ) ( Minsk Passazhirsky railway station , by night trains ) and Murmansk .",
      "The citys former commercial airport Yurievo was decommissioned in 2006 , and the area has now been redeveloped into a residential neighbourhood . The still existing Krechevitsy Airport does not serve any regular flights since mid-1990s although there is a plan to turn Krechevitsy into a new operational airport by 2025 . The nearest international airport is St . Petersburgs Pulkovo , some north of the city .",
      "Local transportation .",
      "Local transportation consists of a network of buses and trolleybuses . The trolleybus network , which currently consists of five routes , started operating in 1995 and is the first trolley system opened in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union .",
      "Honors .",
      "A minor planet , 3799 Novgorod , discovered by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979 , is named after the city .",

      "Real Audiencia of Guatemala",
      "The Real Audiencia of Santiago de Guatemala ( Spanish : Audiencia y Canciller\u00eda Real de Santiago de Guatemala ) , simply known as the Audiencia of Guatemala or the Audiencia of Los Confines , was a superior court in area of the New World empire of Spain , known as the Kingdom of Guatemala . This area included the current territories of Guatemala , Belize , El Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua , Costa Rica and the Mexican state of Chiapas . The Audiencias presiding officer , the president , was the head of the government of the area . The Audiencia was initially created by decrees of November 20 , 1542 and September 13 , 1543 , and had its seat in Antigua Guatemala ( Santiago de Guatemala ) .",
      "Antecedents .",
      "The colonization of the area that became the future kingdom began in 1524 . In the north , the brothers Gonzalo and Pedro de Alvarado , Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and others headed various expeditions into Guatemala and Honduras . In the south Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba , acting under the auspices of Pedrarias D\u00e1vila in Panama , moved into what is today Nicaragua .",
      "The capital of Guatemala moved several times in the first decade of its existence . In 1540 of the city of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala was founded after Tecp\u00e1n Guatemala was abandoned due to its vulnerability to attack . However , the second settlement was destroyed in 1542 by a flood , and the new capital of Antigua Guatemala , was founded to replace the old capital . Although the city of Antigua Guatemala became one of the richest of the New World capitals in the subsequent centuries , this city was in turn ordered abandoned in 1776 , after a series of earthquakes destroyed it . The third capital was the modern-day Guatemala City .",
      "In 1543 establishment of the Audiencia defined the territory of the kingdom , which included most of Central America . It was the first institution to define Central America ( with the exception of Panama ) as a region within the Spanish Empire .",
      "Initial creation .",
      "An Audiencia of Los Confines of Guatemala and Nicaragua was created by a royal decree of November 20 , 1542 , which also established the Audiencia of Lima . The new audiencias divided the territory of the abolished Royal Audiencia of Panama . The governorates of Guatemala , Honduras , Chiapas and Nicaragua , which existed at the time of the decree , were abolished , but some were later restored and new ones created : Honduras in 1552 , Soconusco in 1561 , Nicaragua in 1565 and Costa Rica in 1574 .",
      "The September 13 , 1543 , decree ordered that the new Audiencia move to Valladolid de Comayagua and that the province of Yucat\u00e1n be added to its district , but this was not accomplished until 1550 .",
      "The Audiencia provisionally moved to Gracias a Dios on May 16 , 1544 , until the royal decrees of October 25 , 1548 and June 1 , 1549 , ordered its return to Santiago de Guatemala .",
      "A royal decree of July 7 , 1550 , reiterated that Yucat\u00e1n be separated from the Audiencia of Mexico and incorporated into the one of Guatemala . Finally a decree of January 20 , 1553 , transferred the province of Soconusco to the Guatemala Audiencia .",
      "Move to Panama .",
      "On September 8 , 1563 , Philip II decreed that the Audiencia move to Panama , abolishing a separate audiencia for Guatemala . The borders of the new Panama Audiencia were in east , the coast from the Dari\u00e9n River to the Ul\u00faa River ; and in the west , the coast from Buenaventura to the Gulf of Fonseca . The rest of the territories of the former Audiencia of Guatemala were transferred to the Audiencia of Mexico .",
      "Return to Guatemala .",
      "On January 15 , 1568 , a decree reestablished the Audiencia of Guatemala with the same jurisdiction as in 1563 , but without Yucat\u00e1n , which became a permanent territory of the Audiencia of Mexico until the beginning of the 19th century . A royal decree of January 25 , 1569 , transferred once again the governorate of Soconusco from the Audiencia of Mexico to the one of Guatemala .",

      "In the City of Santiago de los Caballeros of the Province of Guatemala shall reside another Royal Audiencia and Chancery of ours , with a president , governor and captain general ; five oidores , who shall also be judges of criminal cases [ alcaldes del crimen ] ; a crown attorney [ fiscal ] ; a bailiff [ alguacil mayor ] ; a lieutenant of the Gran Chancellor ; and the other necessary ministers and officials , and which shall have for district the said province of Guatemala ; and those of Nicaragua , Chiapas , Higueras , Cabo de Honduras , Verapaz and Soconusco with the Islas de la Costa ; bordering its district in the east with the Audiencia of Tierrafirme , in the west with the one of New Galicia , and in the north with it and the North Sea , and in the south with the South Sea . And we order that the governor and captain general of said provinces and the president of the Royal Audiencia of these , have , use and exercise by himself the government of that land and all its district , in the same manner as does our viceroy of New Spain and determine the repartimientos of Indians and appoint other offices , as said Royal Audiencia used to do , and that the oidores do not interfere with these matters , nor that said president interfere in matters of justice and that he sign with the oidores that which they sentence and decree .",
      "Later developments .",
      "As part of the Bourbon Reforms in 1786 the crown established a series of intendancies in the area , which replaced most of the older corregimientos . The intendants were granted broad fiscal powers and were charged with promoting the local economy . The new intendancies were San Salvador ( El Salvador ) , Ciudad Real ( Chiapas ) , Comayagua ( Honduras ) , and Le\u00f3n ( Nicaragua ) . The Audiencia president and governor-captain general of Guatemala became the superintendente general of the territory and functioned as de facto intendant of Guatemala proper . The agricultural , southern region of Costa Rica remained under a civil and military governor with fiscal oversight of only military expenses ; the expenses of the civil government were handled by the intendant of Le\u00f3n . These intendancies helped shape local political identity and provided the basis of the future nations of Central America ."

      "Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum ( corpus of ancient vases ; abbreviated CVA ) is an international research project for documentation of ancient ceramics . Its original ideal target content : any ceramic from any ancient location during any archaeological period , proved impossible of realization and was soon restricted to specific times and periods . As the project expanded from an original six nations : England , Belgium , Denmark , France , Holland , and Italy . to include the current 28 , the topic specializations of each country were left up to the commission for that country . The French commission ( Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres ) , serves in an advisory position .",
      "The terminology of any commission regarding the target content of any documentation activity must not be confused with archaeological terms . For example , the CVA Online concerns itself with ancient Greek pottery , excluding the pottery of the Bronze Age . Such a decision does not imply that the pottery of the Bronze Age is not ancient Greek , but means only that CVA Onlines ancient Greek category does not include it .",
      "Brief history .",
      "Union Acad\u00e9mique Internationale .",
      "CVA is the first and oldest research project of the Union Acad\u00e9mique Internationale , a federation of academies ( national institutions of an advisory scientific character ) from 61 countries ( 2015 ) . The Union was the inspiration of Edmond Pottier , at the time Curator of Antiquities at the Louvre , the national museum of France ( and former royal palace ) . His interest in the Union , however , went beyond antiquities to any international scientific project .",
      "He called a meeting of representatives from any interested academies in Paris for May , 1919 . The meeting voted the Union into existence . At a second meeting in October , bylaws were passed , after which the Union moved to Brussels ; that is , Brussels was made the home of the General Secretariat , which would preside over day-to-day operations between meetings . Its seat would be the Palace of Academies in Brussels . Maintenance of the Secretariat was to be the responsibility of the Acad\u00e9mie royale des Sciences , des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique . Its secretary would be the Secretary General of the Union . Henri Pirenne was elected president of the Union .",
      "The meetings in 1919 were foundation meetings . At its end 11 countries had joined , the six mentioned above plus Japan , Netherlands , Poland , Russia , and the United States . In addition three more were under contract , but had not sent representatives : Spain , Norway and Romania . The first assembly of the academies was not until 1920 . Operations were to center around research projects , given sequential numbers in order of adoption . Five projects were proposed initially ; three were voted , Project Number 1 being the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum . Currently ( 2015 ) it is the first of 76 .",
      "CVA Project .",
      "The final decision was to publish a comprehensive catalogue of painted ancient Greek vases . He was also the publisher of the first fascicle for the Louvre in 1922 . At that time six countries were part of the project . Today the project covers a compendium of more than 100,000 vases located in collections of 26 participating countries . At present day only public collections located in museums are added to the catalogue .",
      "The CVA mostly publishes Greek ( including Italian ) pottery between the seventh millennium B.C . and late Antiquity ( third-fifth century A.D. ) . The publications are divided into fascicles by country and museum . By the end of 2007 a total of 350 volumes consisting of 40,000 fascicles were published . One of the largest amounts of publications was done in Germany : 84 volumes and 3 supplements .",
      "Since 2004 all textual descriptions and images are freely accessible as a web-based database ( CVA Online ) . Languages allowed for publication are English , French , German and Italian . Further publication rules have to be fulfilled . This often requires a restoration of the actual objects . For example : fragments have to be distinctively different from restored parts . For older restorations this is often not the case .",
      "The documentation of a vessel is done in several steps . First the vessel is described in its overall condition followed by an iconographic interpretation . If possible an artist or a workshop will be determined . Integral parts of the documentation are photographs and hand-drawings depending on the condition of the vessel and the projects budget . The last step of the documentation for a CVA volume is a chronologic classification .",
      "Scientific and Digital Methods .",
      "The Austrian commission used for the first-time of the CVA project a 3D-Scanner for documentation of vessel shapes in 2006 . A follow-up project using 3D-acquisition was granted and a second volume based on 3D-technology published . The high-resolution 3D-datasets of the Austrian projects were processed using the GigaMesh Software Framework providing digital profile lines and unwrappings ( or rollouts ) as basis for the figures of the final publication . Further methods novel to the CVA include Computed Tomography -- in particular X-ray microtomography , Multispectral imaging and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy . In the second half of 2019 rendings including rollouts were shown at the Louvre as part of the 100 years CVA exhibition in the last display cabinet representing the future CVA . Until present day the Austrian commission is the only one using digital methods as well as scientific methods .",
      "Organization .",
      "Every participating country is completely responsible for its own scope , while the Union Acad\u00e9mique Internationale in Brussels has the patronage traditionally led by a French scientist . Currently in charge is Juliette de La Geni\u00e8re ."

      "Biography .",
      "Bilders was born in Utrecht , where he lived until 1856 , though from 1841 to 1845 the Bilders family lived in Oosterbeek , a village near Arnhem which later became a major center for Dutch plein-air-painters . His father Johannes Warnardus Bilders was a Dutch landscape-painter . In 1857 Gerard moved to The Hague .",
      "Bilders was financially supported by the Dutch writer who lived in Oosterbeek since 1851 , where he inhabited a rural estate and invited several young artists as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s . Kneppelhout was rather critical of Bilderss painterly talent and tried to push him into a more literary direction , what Gerard definitely refused . The two men wrote for several years many letters which were published by Kneppelhout [ including Bilders diary-notes of 1860 and 1862 ] , shortly after Bilders death in 1865 .",
      "Bilders received his first drawing lessons from his father , the landscape painter Johannes Warnardus Bilders . From the start of his artistic career Bilders focus was on landscape painting but also on animals in the landscape . Bilders studied at the Academy of Visual Arts in The Hague from about 1857 to 1859 and drew naked and dressed models there . In the Mauritshuis museum he copied Paulus Potters landscapes with cattle ; for a while he was the pupil of landscape and animal painter Charles Humbert in Switzerland . From time to time Gerard Bilders would assist his father by filling in his landscape-painting with animals , as he did a.o . in 1859 by painting some goats in a large forest-landscape of his father , commissioned by a Russian art-seller .",
      "In 1860 they traveled together to the Exposition G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Beaux-Arts in Brussel where he became acquainted for the first time in his life with the painters of the French School of Barbizon . Two times he made a voyage to Switzerland/France ; the first time as of September 1858 , when he painted there together with some artist-friends in open air , in the Savoy .",
      "Later in 1859 he began painting in the county-area around Leiden , often meadows with cattle . Here he tried to reproduce the moods that the Dutch flat landscape evoked by using peculiar light effects as well as a colored , fragrant warm grey . In July 1860 he wrote : I am searching for a tone , which we call colored grey . I mean that all colors , even the strongest , can be brought together in such a way as to give the impression of a warm , vital grey. . When he mixed all the colors of the palette just with grey to get this graying effect , he was usually dissatisfied with the result . His attempts in mixing unbroken colors foreshadowed the later tonal painting style of the Hague School painters .",
      "Gerard Bilders returned to Oosterbeek from 1857 - 1864 where he met Anton Mauve and the Maris brothers , in particular Willem Maris . He died in Amsterdam because of tuberculosis when he was only 26 .",
      "Artistic development and style .",
      "At the end of 1856 and beginning of 1857 Gerard Bilders was frequently visiting the Mauritshuis in The Hague , where he studied and copied the paintings of 17th century Dutch landscape painters , in particular the works of Paulus Potter and Jacob Ruisdael. . He then also wrote his menaces Kneppelhout in a letter how he sought and found refuge in these works ; he felt himself being outside - in the landscape itself , while watching them in the museum . The paintings of Potter and Ruisdael inspired him to copy them carefully and faithfully , but now already he started to recognize at the same time in their works the landscape as a whole ! This was a characteristic point of interest for him , that would return again and again in his later letters and Journal notes . Apparently , wholeness and unity of the expressed landscape were essential elements for him . So he wrote for instance later , on 19 May 1861 : It is not my aim and object to paint a cow for the cows sake or a tree for the trees , but by means of the whole - to create a beautiful and huge impression which nature sometimes creates , also with most simple means",

      "Oliver Bulleid",
      "Oliver Vaughan Snell Bulleid CBE ( 19 September 1882 \u2013 25 April 1970 ) was a British railway and mechanical engineer best known as the Chief Mechanical Engineer ( CME ) of the Southern Railway between 1937 and the 1948 nationalisation , developing many well-known locomotives .",
      "Early life and Great Northern Railway .",
      "He was born in Invercargill , New Zealand , to William Bulleid and his wife Marian Pugh , both British immigrants . On the death of his father in 1889 , his mother returned to Llanfyllin , Wales , where the family home had been , with Bulleid . In 1901 , after a technical education at Accrington Grammar School , he joined the Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) at Doncaster at the age of 18 , as an apprentice under H . A . Ivatt , the Chief Mechanical Engineer ( CME ) . After a four-year apprenticeship , he became the assistant to the Locomotive Running Superintendent , and a year later , the Doncaster Works manager . In 1908 , he left to work in Paris with the French division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a Test Engineer , and was soon promoted to Assistant Works Manager and Chief Draughtsman . Later that year , he married Marjorie Ivatt , Henry Ivatts youngest daughter .",
      "A brief period working for the Board of Trade followed from 1910 , arranging exhibitions in Brussels , Paris and Turin . He was able to travel widely in Europe , later including a trip with Nigel Gresley , William Stanier and Frederick Hawksworth , to Belgium , in 1934 , to see a metre-gauge bogie locomotive . In December 1912 , he rejoined the GNR as Personal Assistant to Nigel Gresley , the new CME . Gresley was only six years Bulleids senior . The First World War intervened ; Bulleid joined the British Army and was assigned to the rail transport arm , rising to the rank of Major . After the war , Bulleid returned to the GNR as the Manager of the Wagon and Carriage Works .",
      "London and North Eastern Railway .",
      "The Grouping , in 1923 , of Britains financially troubled railways , saw the GNR subsumed into the new London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) , and Gresley was appointed the CME . He brought Bulleid back to Doncaster to be his assistant . During this period , Gresley produced the majority of his famous locomotives and innovations , and Bulleid had a hand in many of them , including the P1 2-8-2 freight locomotive , the U1 2-8-0+0-8-2 Garratt freight locomotive , the P2 2-8-2 express locomotive and the A4 4-6-2 express locomotive .",
      "Southern Railway and British Railways .",
      "In 1937 , Bulleid accepted the post of CME of the Southern Railway ( SR ) at an annual salary of \u00a33,000 , after Richard Maunsell retired . His first contribution to the SR was to oversee the construction of three 350 hp six-wheeled diesel-electric shunters ordered by Maunsell in 1936 ; three were built and proved effective , with an order placed for eight more , though this was cancelled owing to the onset of the Second World War . Between 1949 and 1952 , a further 26 of Bulleids amended version of these locomotives were delivered and later became British Rail Class 12 .",
      "In 1938 , Bulleid gained approval to build the Merchant Navy class of modern 4-6-2 Pacifics , undoubtedly inspired by Gresley but also drawing on his experiences from across Europe and with all the most modern equipment : a partially welded boiler and firebox rather than traditional rivetted designs , thermic syphons and a high-pressure boiler . It also included chain-driven valve-gear immersed in an oil bath , a feature that was controversial and later caused problems if not maintained properly , which was difficult , due to conditions , after WW2 .",
      "Bulleid , like other engineers , had long felt that it was not ideal to have working parts exposed to the elements , where they were subject to all the dirt thrown up from the track . He also thought that steam engines should get nearer to the internal combustion engine , which enclosed the working parts and used pump lubrication to keep it all running smoothly . Another advantage of enclosing the valve gear would be reduced day-to-day maintenance . Unfortunately , there were design errors in the casing used for the oil bath , which led to leaks .",
      "The first Merchant Navy , 21C1 Channel Packet , was built in 1941 and 29 followed , the last being 35030 Elder Dempster Lines . The West Country and Battle of Britain slightly smaller light Pacifics followed in 1945 . 110 were built , of which 21C101 Exeter was the first . His other major steam locomotive design , the Q1 Austerity 0-6-0 freight engine , appeared in 1942 . All steam locomotives designed by Bulleid for the SR had his BFB disc wheels , which gave more even tyre support . This did not eliminate the need for balance weights , but the set-up of the Bulleid valve gear enabled a locomotive with no hammer blow . When the locomotives were rebuilt with Walschaerts valve gear , balance weights were installed in the wheels to reduce hammer blow .",
      "Bulleid played a major role in the electrification of the SR , including infrastructure , electric multiple units and electric locomotives . He designed the bodies for the two electric locomotives CC1 and CC2 in 1941 and 1945 . A third example was built by British Railways in 1948 and numbered 20003 . Towards the end of his tenure at the SR , he was responsible for the design and construction of Britains only double-deck passenger trains , the two units of the 4DD class .",
      "His final steam locomotive design for the SR was the unconventional Leader , appearing in 1949 , after nationalisation . This had the boiler , coal and water supplies and everything else encased in a smooth double-ended body reminiscent of a diesel locomotive . The drive was through two six-wheel bogies , each with three cylinders . The axles on each bogie were connected by chains . The Leader was innovative but unsuccessful ; after Bulleid had left British Railways , the project was cancelled .",
      "Bulleid also had responsibility for coaching stock , an area in which he had an active interest . SR coaches , the newest designed by Richard Maunsell , were solid but old-fashioned . Bulleid designs built on the best of the existing designs , while making improvements , and his coaches were known for their comfort and spaciousness . They were popular with the travelling public , and many of the design features such as the size and layout were used by British Railways for their standard Mark I passenger coaches .",
      "Bulleid was briefly the CME of British Railways Southern Region . During this period , his two prototype diesel electric locomotives appeared .",
      "C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann .",
      "In February 1950 , Bulleid was appointed CME of C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann ( CI\u00c9 ) , the nationalised transport authority of the Republic of Ireland , having been a consulting engineer to CI\u00c9 since 1949 . He led the first major dieselisation programme , which involved the procurement of diesel multiple units from AEC of Southall ( the 2600 class ) , 94 Crossley-engined diesel locomotives ( 60 CIE 001 Class and 34 CIE 201 Class ) from Metropolitan-Vickers and 12 Sulzer-engined diesel locomotives ( CIE 101 Class ) from the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company . This began a transformation of railway traction in Ireland , although the locomotives proved unreliable until most were re-engined .",
      "Bulleid developed two prototype peat-burning steam locomotives , one a converted coal-fired traditional steam locomotive of 2-6-0 wheel arrangement and the other , CC1 , new and fully enclosed , along the lines of the Leader design . CI\u00c9 did not adopt peat-fired traction for widespread use .",
      "Recognition and retirement .",
      "Bulleid was elected president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for 1946 . He was also president of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers and of the Institute of Welding , and was elected to the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers .",
      "He was appointed CBE in the 1949 New Year Honours .",
      "Bulleid retired in 1958 , moving to Belstone in Devon , then Exmouth . He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science by the University of Bath in 1967 . Shortly after , he moved to Malta , where he died in 1970 aged 87 .",
      "His obituary in The Times described Bulleid as the last truly original and progressive mechanical engineer of the steam locomotive era in Britain .",

      "Michael Cullen ( politician )",
      "Sir Michael John Cullen ( born 5 February 1945 ) is a former New Zealand politician . He served as Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand , also Minister of Finance , Minister of Tertiary Education , and Attorney-General . He was the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party from 1996 until November 2008 , when he resigned following a defeat in the general election . He resigned from Parliament in April 2009 , to become the deputy chairman of New Zealand Post from 1 November 2009 and chairman from 1 November 2010 . On 6 March 2020 he announced that he had resigned from the Lakes and Bay of Plenty district health boards , respectively . At the same time he also announced that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 small-cell lung cancer , which had also spread to his liver .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Cullen was born in Enfield in north London on 5 February 1945 , the son of Ivy May Cullen ( n\u00e9e Taylor ) and John Joseph Thomas Cullen . His father was a spectacle frame maker and his mother was a secretary . The family emigrated from Tottenham to New Zealand in 1955 , where friends gave him the nick-name Pom , and Cullen attended secondary school at Christs College in Christchurch . He went on to study history at the University of Canterbury , earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 , and a Master of Arts in 1968 . Receiving a Commonwealth Scholarship he then gained a PhD in social and economic history from the University of Edinburgh . He was the first person in his family to attend university . From 1971 to 1981 he was a lecturer at the University of Otago , with a term as a visiting fellow at the Australian National University from 1975 to 1976 . One of his students was future MP Michael Laws , of whom he said A very bright student , but you knew there was something not quite right , even then .",
      "Whilst Cullen was researching his thesis on poverty in the late 19th century in London he discovered that the street in which his maternal grandparents grew up was famed for semi-criminal activities . They proceeded to become working class respectables and then his father became a semi-skilled tradesman .",
      "Cullen became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1975 .",
      "Member of Parliament .",
      "Cullen joined the Labour Party in 1974 , and served on the partys Executive and Council between 1976 and 1981 . In 1981 he was elected MP for the Dunedin electorate of St Kilda . In 1983 he was appointed as Labours spokesperson for the environment .",
      "Fourth Labour Government .",
      "When Labour entered government in 1984 , Cullen became Senior Whip . Due to his knowledge of economics , Cullen became increasingly involved in the disputes surrounding the Minister of Finance , Roger Douglas , who supported the liberalisation of trade and the sale of state assets plus deep tax cuts . These goals , which were against traditional Labour policies , angered both party members and the public . When the Prime Minister , David Lange , attempted to limit the influence Douglas had on the governments direction , Cullen became involved on Langes side . After Labours re-election in 1987 , Cullen was made Associate Minister of Finance ( an attempt by Lange to provide an anti-reform counterbalance to the radical Douglas ) and Minister of Social Welfare .",
      "After Cullen had been elevated to Cabinet , his father died after a long and painful illness , his marriage ended and his dog died prompting him to ponder resigning ; I seriously considered quitting from Cabinet , but the least I could do was stay there for Helen [ Clark ] and David [ Lange ] and make sure we didnt lose social policy to the Rogernomes who were driving so much of the policy . Eventually , Douglas was forced to resign , but a month later the political controversies around the dispute prompted the resignation of Lange himself . Douglas was succeeded as Finance Minister by David Caygill , one of his allies ( albeit a considerably less radical one ) . Cullen was made Associate Minister of Health , in an attempt reduce the effect of reforms on that sector .",
      "In 1989 he married fellow Labour MP Anne Collins .",
      "Opposition .",
      "When Labour lost the 1990 election \u2013 attributed to public anger at Douglas reforms , and disarray within the Labour Party \u2013 Cullen returned to being Labours spokesperson on social welfare . The following year , he replaced David Caygill as the partys chief finance spokesperson . Before Labours position in the polls improved , Cullen was also involved in an attempt to oust Helen Clark as party leader , which was not successful . Soon after , when Caygill decided to retire from politics in 1996 , Cullen took the deputy leaders post unopposed as well . Cullen has claimed to be happy with his position as second , saying that in terms of personality , he is a number two sort of person . Many commentators agree , believing that Cullens strength lies more in administration than leadership .",
      "On 26 August 1999 , Cullen was named by the Speaker Doug Kidd for saying that the National Member Max Bradford had lied , and that he was a stooge of the Employers Federation .",
      "Fifth Labour Government .",
      "Labours electoral victory in 1999 resulted in Cullen becoming Minister of Finance . After the 2002 election , the electoral support for Labours junior coalition partner ( the Progressive Party ) was not sufficient to justify its leader holding the Deputy Prime Minister position , resulting in Michael Cullen replacing Jim Anderton as Deputy Prime Minister .",
      "In 2005 Helen Clark appointed Cullen to the post of Attorney-General following the election of Margaret Wilson as Speaker of the House . His appointment became controversial because of his non-legal background ( only one other non-lawyer had previously held the post ) and because of his previous criticisms of the judiciary , including of the Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias . His term in the position ended following the 2005 general election . However , with the resignation of David Parker in March 2006 , Cullen took over the position again .",
      "He had a reputation as one of the Labour Partys best parliamentary debaters , and is known for his sometimes acerbic sense of humour .",
      "Budget 2006 .",
      "Cullen presented his seventh budget in 2006 . Cullens guiding principle was , he stated , The fool who spends on the upturn will find himself broke on the downturn .",
      "Budget 2007 .",
      "Labours eighth budget in 2007 reduced company tax from 33% to 30%",
      "and introduced a 15% research and development tax credit . It also made a number of changes to the KiwiSaver scheme .",
      "Budget 2008 .",
      "The New Zealand economy entered recession in December 2007 . Cullens final budget was delivered in this context in May 2008 ; it reduced income tax on the first $9,500 earned from 15% to 12.5% , and the company tax rate from 30% to 29% .",
      "Resignation .",
      "The day after the defeat of Labour in the 2008 general elections and Helen Clarks resignation as party leader , Cullen announced his resignation as deputy leader of the Labour Party . When he resigned from Parliament in 2009 he was replaced as an MP from the party list by Damien OConnor .",
      "Political views .",
      "Cullen identifies as a social democrat .",
      "In 2004 Cullen declared his support for the monarchy of New Zealand , describing himself as a sort of token monarchist in the Cabinet these days . However , in 2010 he repudiated that stance , taking the view that New Zealand should move towards a republic once the Queens reign ends .",
      "Cullen voted in favour of the third reading of the Civil Union Bill 2004 , which legalised civil unions in New Zealand .",
      "Post politics .",
      "After leaving parliament , Cullen held a number of roles on the New Zealand civil service , including serving on the Tax Working Group and chairing the Earthquake Commission . He also joined the board of retirement insurance business Lifetime Income .",
      "In March 2020 , Cullen stood down from most of his public roles after announcing that he had been diagnosed with stage IV small-cell lung cancer .",
      "Honours and awards .",
      "In 1990 , Cullen was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal . On 16 December 2009 , Cullen received an honorary LLD from the University of Otago in recognition of his contributions as an Otago academic and as a respected and highly influential politician .",
      "In the 2012 Queens Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours , Cullen was appointed Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit .",

      "Russian Air Force",
      "The Russian Air Force ( , literally military air forces of Russia , VVS ) is a branch of the Russian Aerospace Forces , the latter being formed on 1 August 2015 with the merging of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces . The modern Russian Air Force was originally established on 7 May 1992 following Boris Yeltsins creation of the Ministry of Defence ; however , the Russian Federations air force can trace its lineage and traditions back to the Imperial Russian Air Service ( 1912\u20131917 ) and the Soviet Air Forces ( 1918\u20131991 ) .",
      "The Russian Navy has its own independent air arm , the Russian Naval Aviation , which is the former Soviet Aviatsiya Voyenno-morskogo Flota ( lit . Aviation of the military-sea fleet ) , or AVMF .",
      "History .",
      "1991\u20132000 .",
      "Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union into its fifteen constituent republics in December 1991 , the aircraft and personnel of the Soviet Air Forces\u2014the VVS were divided among the newly independent states . General Pyotr Deynekin , the former deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet Air Forces , became the first commander of the new organisation on 24 August 1991 . Russia received the majority of the most modern fighters and 65% of the manpower . The major commands of the former Soviet VVS\u2014the Long-Range Aviation , Military Transport Aviation and Frontal Aviation were renamed , with few changes , Russian VVS commands . However , many regiments , aircraft , and personnel were claimed by the republics they were based in , forming the core of the new republics air forces . Some aircraft in Belarus and Ukraine ( such as Tupolev Tu-160s ) were returned to Russia , sometimes in return for debt reductions , as well as a long-range aviation division based at Dolon in Kazakhstan .",
      "During the 1990s , the financial stringency was felt throughout the armed forces made its mark on the Russian Air Forces as well . Pilots and other personnel could sometimes not get their wages for months , and on occasion resorted to desperate measures : four MiG-31 pilots at Yelizovo in the Far East went on hunger strike in 1996 to demand back pay which was several months overdue , and the problem was only resolved by diverting unit money intended for other tasks . As a result of the cutbacks , infrastructure became degraded as well , and in 1998 , 40% of military airfields needed repair .",
      "The VVS participated in the First Chechen War ( 1994\u20131996 ) and the Second Chechen War ( 1999\u20132002 ) . These campaigns also presented significant difficulties for the VVS including the terrain , lack of significant fixed targets and insurgents armed with Stinger and Strela-2M surface-to-air missiles .",
      "The former Soviet Air Defence Forces remained independent for several years under Russian control , only merging with the Air Forces in 1998 . The decree merging the two forces was issued by President Boris Yeltsin on 16 July 1997 . During 1998 altogether 580 units and formations were disbanded , 134 reorganised , and over 600 given a new jurisdiction . The redistribution of forces affected 95% of aircraft , 98% of helicopters , 93% of anti-aircraft missile complexes , 95% of the equipment of radiotechnical troops , 100% of anti-aircraft missiles and over 60% of aviation armament . More than 600,000 tons of material changed location and 3,500 aircraft changed airfields . Military Transport Aviation planes took more than 40,000 families to new residence areas .",
      "The short-lived operational commands were abolished . Two air armies , the 37th Air Army ( long-range aviation ) and the 61st Air Army ( former Military Transport Aviation ) , were established directly under the Supreme Command . The former frontal aviation and anti-aircraft forces were organised as Air Force Armies and Anti-Aircraft Defense Armies under the military district commanders . There were initially four such armies with headquarters in St.Petersburg ( Leningrad Military District ) , Rostov-on-Don ( North Caucasus Military District ) , Khabarovsk ( Far East Military District ) , and Chita ( Siberian Military District ) . Two military districts had separate Air and Air Defence Corps . When the Transbaikal Military District and Siberian Military District were merged , the 14th Air Army was reactivated to serve as the air force formation in the area .",
      "The number of servicemen in the air force was reduced to about 185,000 from the former combined number of 318,000 . 123,500 positions were abolished , including almost 1,000 colonel positions . The resignation of 3000 other servicemen included 46 generals of which 15 were colonel generals . On 29 December 1998 Colonel General Anatoly Kornukov , a former Air Defence Forces officer and new commander-in-chief of the merged force , succeeding Deynekin , reported to the Russian defence minister that the task had in principle been achieved . General Kornukov established the new headquarters of the force in Zarya , near Balashikha , 20 km east of the centre of Moscow , in the former PVO central command post , where the CIS common air defence system is directed from .",
      "2001\u20132010 .",
      "In 1999 Vladimir Putin became Prime Minister of Russia and then President in 2000 ; he continued to hold one or the other of these offices through every year since .",
      "In December 2003 the aviation assets of the Russian Ground Forces\u2014mostly helicopters\u2014were transferred to the VVS , following the shooting down of a Mi-26 helicopter in Chechnya on 19 August 2002 , that claimed 19 lives . The former Army Aviation was in its previous form intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces , by providing their tactical air support , conducting tactical aerial reconnaissance , transporting airborne troops , providing fire support of their actions , electronic warfare , setting of minefield barriers and other tasks . The former Army Aviation was subsequently managed by the Chief of the Department of Army Aviation . However , by 2010 , it was announced that the 2003 decision to transfer Ground Force Aviation to the Air Force was reversed , with the transfer back to the Ground Forces to occur sometime in 2015 or 2016 .",
      "During the 2000s , the Air Forces continued to suffer from a lack of resources for pilot training . In the 1990s Russian pilots achieved approximately 10% of the flight hours of the United States Air Force . The 2007 edition of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) Military Balance listed pilots of tactical aviation flying 20\u201325 hours a year , 61st Air Army pilots ( former Military Transport Aviation ) , 60 hours a year , and Army Aviation under VVS control 55 hours a year .",
      "In 2007 the Russian Air Force resumed the Soviet-era practice of deploying its strategic bomber aircraft on long-range patrols . This ended a 15-year unilateral suspension due to fuel costs and other economic difficulties after the collapse of the Soviet Union . Patrols towards the North Pole , the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean were reinstated , bringing the planes often close to NATO territory , including in one instance flying over the Irish Sea between the United Kingdom and Ireland .",
      "During the 2008 South Ossetian War , the Russian Air Force suffered losses of between four and seven aircraft due to Georgian anti-aircraft fire . The 2008 Russian military reforms were promptly announced following the war , which according to Western experts were intended to address many inadequacies discovered as a result . The reforms commenced during early 2009 , in which air armies were succeeded by commands , and most air regiments becoming air bases . Aviation Week & Space Technology confirmed that the reorganisation would be completed by December 2009 and would see a 40 percent reduction in aircrew numbers .",
      "In February 2009 , the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that 200 of the 291 MiG-29s currently in service across all Russian air arms were unsafe and would have to be permanently grounded . This action would remove from service about a third of Russias total fighter force , some 650 aircraft . On 5 June 2009 , the Chief of the General Staff , Nikolai Makarov said of the Russian Air Force that They can run bombing missions only in daytime with the sun shining , but they miss their targets anyway . Maj . Gen . Pavel Androsov said that Russias long-range bombers would be upgraded in 2009 with the aim of being able to hit within 20 meters of their targets .",
      "Also in September 2009 it was reported that an East European network of the Joint CIS Air Defense System was to be set up by Russia and Belarus . This network was intended to protect the airspace of the two countries as defined in the supranational 1999 Union State treaty . Its planned composition was to include five Air Force units , 10 anti-aircraft units , five technical service and support units and one electronic warfare unit . It was to be placed under the command of a Russian or Belarusian Air Force or Air Defence Force senior commander .",
      "In July 2010 , Russian jet fighters made the first nonstop flights from European Russia to the Russian Far East . By August 2010 , according to the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force Aleksandr Zelin , the average flight hours of a pilot in Russian tactical aviation had reached 80 hours a year , while in army aviation and military transport aviation it exceeded 100 hours a year . On 15 August 2010 , the Russian Air Force temporarily grounded its fleet of Su-25 ground attack aircraft to conduct an investigation into a crash that happened during a training mission . The Russian Defence Ministry said that the plane crashed on 6 August 2010 , 60 km to the north-west of Step air base in Siberia , according to RIA Novosti .",
      "2011\u20132020 .",
      "According to the instructions of the General Staff of the Armed Forces on 1 September 2011 , the unmanned aircraft of the Russian Air Force and the personnel operating them moved under the command structure of the Russian Ground Forces .",
      "As of 2012 , the Russian Air Force operated a total of 61 air bases , including 26 air bases with tactical aircraft , of which 14 are equipped with fighter aircraft . In terms of flight hours , pilots in the Western Military District averaged 125 hours over the 2012 training year . Pilots from the Kursk air base achieved an average of 150 hours , with transport aviation averaging 170 hours .",
      "In February 2014 , during the early periods of Russias annexation of Crimea , the Russian Air Forces assets of the Southern Military District were activated and flown to the peninsula for supporting the rest of the operations .",
      "On 1 August 2015 , the Russian Air Force , along with the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces and the Air Defense Troops , were merged into a new branch of the armed forces , now officially called the Russian Aerospace Forces .",
      "On 30 September 2015 , the Russian Air Force launched a military intervention in Syria , in Syrias Homs region . On 24 November 2015 , during a bombing mission , a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 that Turkey claimed had violated its airspace .",
      "In March 2020 , the indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets by the Russian Air Force in Syria has been described as amounting to war crime by UN HRC report .",
      "On 9 November 2020 , a Russian Mil Mi-24 attack helicopter was shot down mistakenly by the Azerbaijani Armed Forces during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war killing 2 crew members and injuring 1 more . Days later , after the signing of the ceasefire agreement , Russian peacekeepers were deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh with aviation for patrolling its borders .",
      "2021\u2013present .",
      "Modernisation plans and programs carried out since the 2010s are being continued into 2021 as a part of Russias State Armament Program for 2018\u20132027 .",
      "Leadership .",
      "Previously the highest military office until 1 August 2015 .",
      "Since the merger between the Russian Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces on 1 August 2015 , the commander of the Russian Air Force as part of the new Russian Aerospace Forces is titled Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces and Commander of the Russian Air Force . Lieutenant General Andrey Yudin became the first holder of the position until he was succeeded by Lieutenant General Sergey Dronov in August 2019 .",
      "Structure .",
      "In 2009 the structure of the Russian Air Force was completely changed to a command-air base structure from the previous structure of air army-air division or corps-air regiment . The VVS is now divided to 4 operational commands , the Aerospace Defense Operational Strategic Command ( seemingly primarily made up of the former Special Purpose Command ) , the Military Transport Aviation Command , and the Long-Range Aviation Command . This listing is a composite ; the available new information covers frontline forces , and the forces of central subordination are as of approximately August 2008 . Warfare.ru maintains what appears to be a reasonably up to date listing , and Combat Aircraft magazine in June 2010 listed their organisations estimate of the new order of battle .",
      "This listing appears to be as of June 2009 :",

      "Alexander Prokhorov",
      "Alexander Mikhailovich Prokhorov ( born Alexander Michael Prochoroff , ; 11 July 1916 \u2013 8 January 2002 ) was an Australian-born Soviet-Russian physicist known for his pioneering research on lasers and masers in the Soviet Union for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 with Charles Hard Townes and Nikolay Basov .",
      "Early life .",
      "Alexander Michael Prochoroff was born on 11 July 1916 at Russell Road Peeramon , Queensland , Australia ( now 322 Gadaloff Road , Butchers Creek , situated about 30 km from Atherton ) , to Mikhail Ivanovich Prokhorov and Maria Ivanovna ( n\u00e9e Mikhailova ) , Russian revolutionaries who had emigrated from Russia to escape repression by the tsarist government . As a child he attended Butchers Creek School . In 1923 , after the October Revolution , the family returned to Russia . In 1934 , Prokhorov entered the Saint Petersburg State University to study physics . He was a member of the Komsomol from 1930 to 1944 . Prokhorov graduated with honors in 1939 and moved to Moscow to work at the Lebedev Physical Institute , in the oscillations laboratory headed by academician N . D . Papaleksi . His research there was devoted to propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere . At the onset of World War II in the Soviet Union , in June 1941 , he joined the Red Army . During World War II , Prokhorov fought in the infantry , was wounded twice in battles , and was awarded three medals , including the Medal For Courage in 1946 . He was demobilized in 1944 and returned to the Lebedev Institute where , in 1946 , he defended his Ph.D . thesis on Theory of Stabilization of Frequency of a Tube Oscillator in the Theory of a Small Parameter .",
      "Research .",
      "In 1947 , Prokhorov started working on coherent radiation emitted by electrons orbiting in a cyclic particle accelerator called a synchrotron . He demonstrated that the emission is mostly concentrated in the microwave spectral range . His results became the basis of his habilitation on Coherent Radiation of Electrons in the Synchrotron Accelerator , defended in 1951 . By 1950 , Prokhorov was assistant chief of the oscillation laboratory . Around that time , he formed a group of young scientists to work on radiospectroscopy of molecular rotations and vibrations , and later on quantum electronics . The group focused on a special class of molecules which have three ( non-degenerate ) moments of inertia . The research was conducted both on experiment and theory . In 1954 , Prokhorov became head of the laboratory . Together with Nikolay Basov he developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such an oscillator based on ammonia . They also proposed a method for the production of population inversion using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields . Their results were first presented at a national conference in 1952 , but not published until 1954\u20131955 ;",
      "In 1955 , Prokhorov started his research in the field of electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) . He focused on relaxation times of ions of the iron group elements in a lattice of aluminium oxide , but also investigated other , non-optical , topics , such as magnetic phase transitions in DPPH . In 1957 , while studying ruby , a chromium-doped variation of aluminium oxide , he came upon the idea of using this material as an active medium of a laser . As a new type of laser resonator , he proposed , in 1958 , an open type cavity design , which is widely used today . In 1963 , together with A . S . Selivanenko , he suggested a laser using two-quantum transitions . For his pioneering work on lasers and masers , in 1964 , he received the Nobel Prize in Physics shared with Nikolay Basov and Charles Hard Townes .",
      "Posts and awards .",
      "In 1959 , Prokhorov became a professor at Moscow State University \u2013 the most prestigious university in the Soviet Union ; the same year , he was awarded the Lenin Prize . In 1960 , he became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and elected Academician in 1966 . In 1967 , he was awarded his first Order of Lenin ( he received five of them during life , in 1967 , 1969 , 1975 , 1981 and 1986 ) . In 1968 , he became vice-director of the Lebedev Institute and in 1971 took the position of Head of Laboratory of another prestigious Soviet institution , the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology . In the same year , he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . In 1983 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina . Between 1982 and 1998 , Prokhorov served as acting director of the General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and after 1998 as honorary director . After his death in 2002 , the institute was renamed the A . M . Prokhorov General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences . Prokhorov was a Member and one of the Honorary Presidents of the International Academy of Science , Munich and supported 1993 the foundation and development of the Russian Section of International Academy of Science , Moscow .",
      "In 1969 , Prokhorov became a Hero of Socialist Labour , the highest degree of distinction in the Soviet Union for achievements in national economy and culture . He received the second such award in 1986 . Starting in 1969 , he was the chief editor of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia . He was awarded the Frederic Ives Medal , the highest distinction of the Optical Society of America ( OSA ) , in 2000 and became an Honorary OSA Member in 2001 . The same year , he was awarded the Demidov Prize .",
      "Politics .",
      "Prokhorov became a member of the Communist Party in 1950 . In 1983 , together with three other academicians \u2013 Andrey Tychonoff , Anatoly Dorodnitsyn and Georgy Skryabin \u2013 he signed the famous open letter denouncing Andrey Sakharovs article in the Foreign Affairs .",
      "Family .",
      "Both of Prokhorovs parents died during World War II . Prokhorov married geographer Galina Shelepina in 1941 , and they had a son , Kiril , born in 1945 . Following his father , Kiril Prokhorov became a physicist in the field of optics and is currently leading a laser-related laboratory at the A . M . Prokhorov General Physics Institute .",

      "DRB Class 50",
      "The DRB Class 50 is a German class of 2-10-0 locomotive , built from 1939 as a standard locomotive ( Einheitsdampflokomotive ) for hauling goods trains . It had one leading axle and five coupled axles and was one of the most successful designs produced for the Deutsche Reichsbahn .",
      "This class was procured as part of the German Nazi partys preparations for war that led into the Second World War . Up to 1948 , 3,164 Class 50 engines were built by almost all the European locomotive factories \u2013 towards the end as so-called provisional war locomotives ( \u00dcbergangskriegslokomotiven ) and classified as 50 \u00dcK .",
      "At the end of the steam locomotive era , they became virtually a universal class of mixed-traffic steam engine that , thanks to their low axle load , could even be employed on branch lines with light track beds . The Deutsche Bundesbahn grouped the locomotives into Classes 050 , 051 , 052 and 053 from 1968 so that the numbers were computer-compatible .",
      "Some of the class were used by the Polish State Railways as type Ty5 .",
      "General .",
      "In spite of wartime losses , a large number of engines still remained in 1945 . No fewer than 2,159 working locomotives were taken over by the Deutsche Bundesbahn alone and , for a long time , they formed the backbone of goods traffic operations together with the larger DRG Class 44 . They were also used for passenger services .",
      "To protect the engine crew when running in reverse , the front of the tender ( a 22 T 26 ) was furnished with a protective shield . On many locomotives the Wagner smoke deflectors were replaced by the Witte model after the war . On 735 of the DB machines the tender was fitted with a conductors cab , which meant that the volume of the coal bunker had to be reduced .",
      "1452 locomotives were included in the new DB classification scheme . That said , 88 of them were already earmarked for withdrawal . Because the class number now had to consist of 3 figures , the designations 051 , 052 and 053 had to be introduced in addition to 050 .",
      "As a result , the old Class 50 was divided as shown in the table :",
      "The last DB locomotives were retired from Duisburg-Wedau in 1977 .",
      "Only 350 examples of Class 50 engines remained in with the DR in East Germany after the war . Because only a small number of the numerous Class 44 fleet went to East Germany , the DRB Class 52 was the predominant goods train locomotive in many areas there . Of the Class 50s , 208 units were rebuilt into Class 50.35-37 engines . The original locomotives ran mainly in the south . From the middle of the 1970s they were retired in large numbers , so that in the 1980s they were real rarities . Nevertheless , the last ones ended their active duties in 1987 together with the rebuilds ( Rekoloks ) .",
      "Some of the original locomotives are preserved , including 50 622 and 50 849 . No . 50 622 is stabled in the Nuremberg Transport Museum , where , on the evening of 17 October 2005 , it was badly damaged in the great fire at the locomotive shed . The engine should however be able to be repaired with the aid of donations . No . 50 849 belongs to the Glauchau Railway Society ( Eisenbahnverein Glauchau ) and has a Wagner smoke deflector .",
      "After the Second World War many examples of Class 50 engines were left in the other European states and some were used until the end of the steam traction era . For example , they were in service with the PKP ( 55 redesignated PKP class Ty5 ) , the \u010cSD ( 28 redesignated class 555.1 ) , the \u00d6BB and the DSB .",
      "DB Class 50.40 .",
      "Because the Deutsche Bundesbahn had sufficient goods train locomotives , they could quickly phase out the DRB Class 52 engines , so that the ageing boilers on the Class 50s could be replaced by those of the Class 52s . Even the trough tender of the Kriegslokomotiven was used by the 50s amongst others . In the 1950s , several Class 50 locomotives served as trials engines . Thus 35 machines were given a boiler with mixer preheater and turbo feed pumps . Number 50 1503 was experimentally equipped with a Giesl ejector . In 1959 ten locomotives were given a boiler with smaller grate area in order to try to reduce the consumption of coal .",
      "After experience with Franco-Crosti boilers on Class 52 locomotives ( DB Class 42.90 ) , Henschel rebuilt number 50 1412 in 1954 with such a boiler . This included a second preheater boiler underneath the actual locomotive boiler itself . After the smoke gases had flowed through the main boiler , they were turned around and passed through the preheater boiler . They escaped into the atmosphere through a side chimney along with the exhaust steam . The feed water was initially heated in a surface or mixer preheater , then in the preheater boiler before entering the main boiler . In this way the heat energy of the combustion gases could be better utilised and fuel consumption reduced . In 1958 , 30 more engines were given Franco-Crosti smoke gas preheaters . These locos were redesignated as 50 4001 to 50 4031 . Number 50 4011 was given oil firing . It was deployed in M\u00fcnsterland and in the Rhineland . The locomotives were retired by 1967 .",
      "Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen describes in his book \u201eAnatomie der Dampflokomotive\u201c that the Sulfuric acid in the smoke condensed in the preheater and attacked the Heat exchanger . The conversion to Diesel and Electric locos led Italy and Germany both to abandon development of the Franco Crosti smoke pre-heater .",
      "No locomotive was preserved .",
      "DR Class 50.35-37 .",
      "At the end of the 1930s , it was thought that a suitable boiler material had been found , in the form of St 47 K-Mo steel , that would allow boiler pressure to be increased to 20 bar without significantly raising the total weight of the boiler . The newly developed steel had a higher strength than the type of steel ( St 34 ) used hitherto , but its disadvantage was that it had considerably worse conductivity . In the harsh everyday work of steam locomotives the material became very quickly fatigued , so that boilers made of the new steel had to be replaced after only a few years . The Class 50 , too , was given such a boiler to begin with . Even though its condition was less critical than with other classes , it urgently needed replacing by the end of the 1950s . As a result , the DR in East Germany had the 50E replacement boiler developed on the basis of the new boilers equipping the Class 23.10 / 50.40 , although because the locomotive frames were different it was given a 500 mm longer boiler barrel . This was later used on the rebuilds ( the so-called Rekoloks ) , which saw the conversion of Class 23 engines , as well as conversions of the Class 52s into 52.80s and the Class 58s into 58.30s . Between 1958 and 1962 , 208 Class 50 locomotives were given such a boiler , along with a mixer preheater , a larger radiative heating area and improved suction draught , which also raised its performance . Many engines were also equipped with Giesl ejectors . These Reko locomotives were allocated to sub-class 50.35 and given operating numbers 50 3501 to 50 3708 . In their last years of operation these engines often ran with the new 22 T 28 tenders .",
      "The engines were soon gathered together in the railway divisions of the northwest . After the conversion of engines to oil-fired Class 50.50 , the remaining coal-fired ones were concentrated in the Magdeburg division . Replacing older locomotives as well as oil-fired ones , they returned to the Dresden and Schwerin divisions again by the end of the 1970s .",
      "The last regular standard gauge steam train was hauled by a Class 50.35 locomotive . This was number 50 3559 , which headed an official farewell service on 29 October 1988 on a round trip from Halberstadt to Magdeburg , Thale and back to Halberstadt . No . 50 3559 is used in Liblar as a restaurant .",
      "There are several Class 50.35 locomotives , several of them still working , belonging to Deutsche Bahn AG and the many museum railways and railway museums , such as numbers 50 3501 , 50 3539 , 50 3564 , 50 3576 , 50 3616 , 50 3648 , 50 3654 , 50 3695 and 50 3708 .",
      "DR Class 50.50 .",
      "Between 1966 and 1971 , 72 Class 50.35 locomotives were converted to oil-firing . To distinguish them , they were re-designated as Class 50.50 . From the introduction of EDP numbers in 1970 they were given operating numbers 50 0001 to 50 0072 . They were stationed in the Reichsbahn divisions of Schwerin and Greifswald and used for heavy goods train duties . Their sudden withdrawal in 1981 was a political decision as a result of the cost of crude oil prices in the Eastern Bloc which had suddenly risen sharply . This meant that they could now chemically process Bunker oil D ; with the result that it was not longer available for locomotive firing .",
      "In the Bavarian Railway Museum ( Bayerischen Eisenbahnmuseum ) in N\u00f6rdlingen the last representative of this class , number 50 0072 , is preserved .",
      "DR Class 50.40 .",
      "As well as modern passenger train locomotives , the DR in East Germany needed more goods train locomotives with a 15 t axle load . As a result , a parallel development , like those of the pre-war time , was initiated for a passenger train engine , the DR Class 23.10 , and a goods train engine , the DR Class 50.40 , in order that many of their components could be interchangeable . The running gear conformed broadly to that of the Einheitslok , but a plate frame had to be used , because bar frames could no longer be worked . The boiler was a new build to modern construction standards with a combustion chamber and a mixer preheater . In terms of performance it was roughly comparable to the standard boiler , but was somewhat more economic in its fuel consumption . The locomotives were also given new tenders , the 22 T 28 . The 88 engines , which were renumbered from 50 4001 to 50 4088 , were delivered between 1956 and 1960 . Number 50 4088 was therefore the last standard gauge steam engine to be newly built in Germany . They were permanently stationed on the routes over the plains in the northern railway divisions . Because the plate frame soon proved to be the weakest link ( with a high repair bill ) , the locos were taken out of traction service by 1980 , but continued to be used as heating engines .",
      "The Bavarian Railway Museum ( Bayerische Eisenbahnmuseum ) in N\u00f6rdlingen has acquired the last preserved engine of this type , number 50 4073 . It is currently in the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works at and is awaiting external refurbishment .",
      "Other Railway Companies .",
      "After the Second World War several Class 50 locomotives were left in eastern Europe , where some of the railway administrations procured more of them . For example , the Romanian State Railway CFR produced 282 copies of Class 50 locomotives between 1947 and 1959 . 40 Romanian 150s supplied to China in 1958 , they became class DK5 in 1959 and numbered 241\u2013280 . DK5-250 is preserved at the Shenyang Railway Museum . Some were also supplied to the Korean State Railway in North Korea , where they were numbered in the 150 series ."

      "Thomas Fearnley",
      "Thomas Fearnley ( 27 December 1802 \u2013 16 January 1842 ) was a Norwegian romantic painter , a pupil of Johan Christian Dahl and a leading representative of Norwegian romantic nationalism in painting .",
      "His son Thomas Fearnley ( 1841\u20131927 ) founded the Fearnley dynasty of shipping magnates .",
      "Background .",
      "Thomas Fearnley was born in Frederikshald ( now Halden ) in \u00d8stfold , Norway . He was the son of merchant Thomas Fearnley ( 1768\u20131834 ) and Maren Sophie Paus ( 1782\u20131838 ) . He was the brother of astronomer and professor Carl Frederik Fearnley ( 1818\u20131890 ) . Fearnleys grandfather , merchant Thomas Fearnley ( 1729\u20131798 ) , immigrated from Yorkshire , England to Frederikshald , Norway in 1753 . His mother was the daughter of a wealthy merchant who belonged to the Paus family , a prominent family from Telemark .",
      "In 1840 , he married Cecilia Catharine Andresen ( 1817\u20131888 ) . She was the daughter of his benefactor , banker Nicolai Andresen ( 1781\u20131861 ) , who founded what became the Andresen Bank , one of Norways largest commercial banks of its time . In the autumn of 1841 , the couple went to Amsterdam for the birth of their only child , Thomas Nicolay Fearnley ( 1841\u20131927 ) , who became a Norwegian shipping magnate . His grandsons were shipping magnate Thomas Fearnley ( 1880\u20131961 ) and land owner N . O . Young Fearnley . His descendants founded the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in 1993 .",
      "Career .",
      "Thomas Fearnley attended National Cadet Corps ( Landkadettkorpset ) from 1814 to 1819 . He was a student of the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry ( Den kongelige Tegneskole ) ( 1819\u20131821 ) , Art Academy ( Kunstakadamie ) in Copenhagen ( 1821\u20131823 ) and the Art Academy ( Konstakadamien ) in Stockholm ( 1823\u201327 ) under .",
      "Fearnley left Copenhagen bound for Stockholm in the autumn of 1823 to complete a painting commissioned by Crown Prince Oscar of Norway and Sweden . He received several orders from the Swedish royal family and from other members of the royal court including Swedish Count . He conducted study tours in Norway ( 1824-1826 ) , at which time he met Johan Christian Dahl in Sogn . After another stay in Copenhagen from 1827 to 1828 and a new Norwegian trip in the autumn of 1828 , he went to Germany and was a student of Dahl in Dresden ( 1829\u20131830 ) as well as befriending the German painter Joseph Petzl and the German-Danish painter Friedrich Bernhard Westphal . He lived in Munich ( 1830\u201332 ) .",
      "Fearnley traveled extensively in the 1830s , visiting Munich , Paris , London , Hull and the English Lake district . During September 1832 , he went from Venice to Rome and visited Sicily the following summer . He mostly painted in small towns south of Naples : Castellammare , Amalfi , Sorrento , Capri and in Switzerland : Meiringen , Grindelwald . He went to Paris in the summer of 1835 and visited London the next year . During the summer of 1839 he was on a study tour to the Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord , together with the German painter Andreas Achenbach .",
      "Fearnleys paintings alternate between oil sketches and larger , composed landscapes meant for exhibition . His large studio compositions have a cool monumental attitude with a taste for the powerful and wildly romantic in the favorite motifs , wilderness and waterfalls , and with a strong emphasis on the images architectural structure . The National Gallery in Oslo owns a total of 54 of his smaller pictures and sketches and also a series of drawings . Notable works in this collection include Labrofossen ( 1837 ) , Grindelwaldgletsjeren ( 1838 ) and Slinde Birken ( 1839 ) . Other notable collections are located in the and the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm .",
      "Death .",
      "Fearnley contracted typhoid and died in January 1842 when he was only 39 years old . He was initially buried on S\u00fcdlicher Friedhof in Munich . In 1922 , his son arranged to have his fathers mortal remains moved to V\u00e5r Frelsers gravlund in Oslo ."

      "Gerhard Schr\u00f6der",
      "Gerhard Fritz Kurt Schr\u00f6der ( ; born 7 April 1944 ) is a German politician who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1998 to 2005 , during which his most important political initiative was Agenda 2010 . As the Leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) , he led a coalition government of the SPD and the Greens . Schr\u00f6der has been chairman of Russian energy company Rosneft since 2017 .",
      "Before becoming a full-time politician , he was a lawyer , and before becoming Chancellor he served as Prime Minister of Lower Saxony ( 1990\u20131998 ) . Following the 2005 federal election , which his party lost , after three weeks of negotiations he stood down as Chancellor in favour of Angela Merkel of the rival Christian Democratic Union . He is currently the chairman of the board of Nord Stream AG and of Rosneft , after having been hired as a global manager by investment bank Rothschild , and also the chairman of the board of football club Hannover 96 .",
      "Early life and education .",
      "Schr\u00f6der was born in Blomberg , Lippe , Greater German Reich . His father , Fritz Schr\u00f6der , a lance corporal in the Wehrmacht , was killed in action in World War II in Romania on 4 October 1944 , almost six months after Gerhards birth . His mother , Erika ( n\u00e9e Vosseler ) , worked as an agricultural laborer to support herself and her two sons .",
      "Schr\u00f6der completed an apprenticeship in retail sales in a Lemgo hardware shop from 1958 to 1961 and subsequently worked in a Lage retail shop and after that as an unskilled construction worker and a sales clerk in G\u00f6ttingen while studying at night school for a general qualification for university entrance ( Abitur ) . He did not have to do military service because his father had died in the war . In 1966 , Schr\u00f6der secured entrance to a university , passing the Abitur exam at Westfalen-Kolleg , Bielefeld . From 1966 to 1971 he studied law at the University of G\u00f6ttingen . From 1972 onwards , Schr\u00f6der served as teaching assistant at the university . In 1976 , he passed his second law examination , and he subsequently worked as a lawyer until 1990 .",
      "Among his more controversial cases , Schr\u00f6der helped Horst Mahler , a founding member of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist group , to secure both an early release from prison and permission to practice law again in Germany .",
      "Early political career .",
      "Schr\u00f6der joined the Social Democratic Party in 1963 . In 1978 he became the federal chairman of the Young Socialists , the youth organisation of the SPD . He spoke for the dissident Rudolf Bahro , as did President Jimmy Carter , Herbert Marcuse , and Wolf Biermann .",
      "Member of the German Bundestag , 1980\u20131986 .",
      "In 1980 , Schr\u00f6der was elected to the German Bundestag ( federal parliament ) , where he wore a sweater instead of the traditional suit . Under the leadership of successive chairmen Herbert Wehner ( 1980\u201383 ) and Hans-Jochen Vogel ( 1983\u201386 ) , he served in the SPD parliamentary group . He also became chairman of the SPD Hanover district .",
      "Considered ambitious from early on in his political career , it was widely reported and never denied , that in 1982 , a drunken Schr\u00f6der stood outside the West German federal chancellery yelling : I want to get in . That same year , he wrote an article on the idea of a red/green coalition for a book at Olle & Wolter , Berlin ; this appeared later in Die Zeit . Chancellor Willy Brandt , the SPD and SI chairman , who reviewed Olle & Wolter at that time , had just asked for more books on the subject .",
      "In 1985 , Schr\u00f6der met the GDR leader Erich Honecker during a visit to East Berlin . In 1986 , Schr\u00f6der was elected to the parliament of Lower Saxony and became leader of the SPD group .",
      "Minister-President of Lower Saxony , 1990\u20131998 .",
      "After the SPD won the state elections in June 1990 , Schr\u00f6der became Minister-President of Lower Saxony as head of an SPD-Greens coalition ; in this position , he also won the 1994 and 1998 state elections . He was subsequently also appointed to the supervisory board of Volkswagen , the largest company in Lower Saxony and of which the state of Lower Saxony is a major stockholder .",
      "Following his election as Minister-President in 1990 , Schr\u00f6der also became a member of the board of the federal SPD . In 1997 and 1998 , he served as President of the Bundesrat . Between 1994 and 1998 , he was also chairman of Lower Saxonian SPD .",
      "During Schr\u00f6ders time in office , first in coalition with the environmentalist Green Party , then with a clear majority , Lower Saxony became one of the most deficit-ridden of Germanys 16 federal states and unemployment rose higher than the national average of 12 percent . Ahead of the 1994 elections , SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping included Schr\u00f6der in his shadow cabinet for the partys campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Kohl as Chancellor . During the campaign , Schr\u00f6der served as shadow minister of economic affairs , energy and transport .",
      "In 1996 , Schr\u00f6der caused controversy by taking a free ride on the Volkswagen corporate jet to attend the Vienna Opera Ball , along with Volkswagen CEO Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch . The following year , he nationalized a big steel mill in Lower Saxony to preserve jobs .",
      "In the 1998 state elections , Sch\u00f6ders Social Democrats increased their share of the vote by about four percentage points over the 44.3 percent they recorded in the previous elections in 1994 \u2013 a postwar record for the party in Lower Saxony that reversed a string of Social Democrat reversals in state elections elsewhere .",
      "Chancellor of Germany , 1998\u20132005 .",
      "First term , 1998\u20132002",
      "Following the 1998 national elections , Schr\u00f6der became Chancellor as head of an SPD-Green coalition . Throughout his campaign for Chancellor , he portrayed himself as a pragmatic new Social Democrat who would promote economic growth while strengthening Germanys generous social welfare system .",
      "After the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine as SPD Chairman in March 1999 , in protest at Schr\u00f6ders adoption of a number of what Lafontaine considered neo-liberal policies , Schr\u00f6der took over his rivals office as well . In April 1999 , in Germanys first session in the restored Reichstag , to applause he quoted Albanian writer Ismail Kadare , saying : The Balkans is the yard of the European house , and in no house can peace prevail so long as people kill each other in its yard . he In a move meant to signal a deepening alliance between Schr\u00f6der and Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom , the two leaders issued an eighteen-page manifesto for economic reform in June 1999 . Titled Europe : The Third Way , or Die Neue Mitte in German , it called on Europes centre-left governments to cut taxes , pursue labour and welfare reforms and encourage entrepreneurship . The joint paper said European governments needed to adopt a supply-side agenda to respond to globalisation , the demands of capital markets and technological change .",
      "Schr\u00f6ders efforts backfired within his own party though , where its left-wing rejected the Schr\u00f6der-Blair call for cutbacks to the welfare state and pro-business policies . Instead , the paper took part of the blame for a succession of six German state election losses in 1999 for the Social Democratic Party . Only by 2000 , Schr\u00f6der managed to capitalise on the donations scandal of his Christian Democratic opposition to push through a landmark tax reform bill and re-establish his dominance of the German political scene .",
      "Schr\u00f6ders tenure oversaw the seat of government move from Bonn to Berlin . In May 2001 , Schr\u00f6der moved to his new official residence , the Chancellery building in Berlin , almost two years after the city became the seat of the German Government . He had previously been working out of the building in eastern Berlin used by the former leaders of East Germany .",
      "Second term , 2002\u20132005",
      "Throughout the build-up to the 2002 German election , the Social Democrats and the Green Party trailed the centre-right candidate Edmund Stoiber until the catastrophe caused by rising floodwater in Germany led to an improvement in his polling numbers . Furthermore , his popular opposition to a war in Iraq dominated campaigning in the run-up to the polls . At 22 September vote , he secured another four-year term , with a narrow nine-seat majority ( down from 21 ) .",
      "In February 2004 , Schr\u00f6der resigned as chairman of the SPD amid growing criticism from across his own party of his reform agenda ; Franz M\u00fcntefering succeeded him as chairman . On 22 May 2005 , after the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats ( CDU ) in North Rhine-Westphalia , Gerhard Schr\u00f6der announced he would call federal elections as soon as possible . A motion of confidence was subsequently defeated in the Bundestag on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 ( with 148 abstaining ) , after Schr\u00f6der urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections . In response , a grouping of left-wing SPD dissidents and the neo-communist Party of Democratic Socialism agreed to run on a joint ticket in the general election , with Schr\u00f6ders rival Oskar Lafontaine leading the new group .",
      "The 2005 German federal elections were held on 18 September . After the elections , neither Schr\u00f6ders SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by Angela Merkel achieved a majority in parliament , but the CDU/CSU had a stronger popular electoral lead by one percentage point . On election night , both Schr\u00f6der and Merkel claimed victory and chancellorship , but after initially ruling out a grand coalition with Merkel , Schr\u00f6der and M\u00fcntefering entered negotiations with her and the CSUs Edmund Stoiber . On 10 October , it was announced that the parties had agreed to form a grand coalition . Schr\u00f6der agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel , but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy . Merkel was elected chancellor on 22 November .",
      "On 11 October 2005 , Schr\u00f6der announced that he would not take a post in the new Cabinet and , in November , he confirmed that he would leave politics as soon as Merkel took office . On 23 November 2005 , he resigned his Bundestag seat .",
      "On 14 November 2005 , at a SPD conference in Karlsruhe , Schr\u00f6der urged members of the SPD to support the proposed coalition , saying it carries unmistakably , perhaps primarily , the imprint of the Social Democrats . Many SPD members had previously indicated that they supported the coalition , which would have continued the policies of Schr\u00f6ders government , but had objected to Angela Merkel replacing him as Chancellor . The conference voted overwhelmingly to approve the deal .",
      "Domestic policies .",
      "In his first term , Schr\u00f6ders government decided to phase out nuclear power , fund renewable energies , institute civil unions for same-sex partners , and liberalise the naturalization law .",
      "During Schr\u00f6ders time in office , economic growth slowed to only 0.2% in 2002 and Gross Domestic Product shrank in 2003 , while German unemployment was over the 10% mark . Most voters soon associated Schr\u00f6der with the Agenda 2010 reform program , which included cuts in the social welfare system ( national health insurance , unemployment payments , pensions ) , lower taxes , and reformed regulations on employment and payment . He also eliminated capital gains tax on the sale of corporate stocks and thereby made the country more attractive to foreign investors .",
      "After the 2002 election , the SPD steadily lost support in opinion polls . Many increasingly perceived Schr\u00f6ders Third Way program to be a dismantling of the German welfare state . Moreover , Germanys high unemployment rate remained a serious problem for the government . Schr\u00f6ders tax policies were also unpopular ; when the satirical radio show The Gerd Show released Der Steuersong , featuring Schr\u00f6ders voice ( by impressionist Elmar Brandt ) lampooning Germanys indirect taxation with the lyrics Dog tax , tobacco tax , emissions and environmental tax , did you really think more werent coming? , it became Germanys 2002 Christmas #1 hit and sold over a million copies . The fact that Schr\u00f6der served on the Volkswagen board ( a position that came with his position as minister-president of Lower Saxony ) and tended to prefer pro-car policies led to him being nicknamed the Auto-Kanzler ( car chancellor ) .",
      "European integration .",
      "In 1997 , Schr\u00f6der joined the ministers-president of two other German states , Kurt Biedenkopf and Edmund Stoiber , in making the case for a five-year delay in Europes currency union . After taking office , he made his first official trip overseas to France for meetings with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in October 1998 . A 2001 meeting held by both leaders in Blaesheim later gave the name to a regular series of informal meetings between the French President , the German Chancellor , and their foreign ministers . The meetings were held alternately in France and Germany . At the fortieth anniversary of the Elys\u00e9e Treaty , both sides agreed that rather than summits being held twice a year , there would now be regular meetings of a council of French and German ministers overseen by their respective foreign affairs ministers . In an unprecedented move , Chirac formally agreed to represent Schr\u00f6der in his absence at a European Council meeting in October 2003 .",
      "In his first months in office , Schr\u00f6der vigorously demanded that Germanys net annual contribution of about $12,000,000,000 to the budget of the European Union be cut , saying his country was paying most for European waste . He later moderated his views when his government held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 1999 .",
      "In 2003 , Schr\u00f6der and Chirac agreed to share power in the institutions of the European Union between a President of the European Commission , elected by the European Parliament , and a full-time President of the European Council , chosen by heads of state and government ; their agreement later formed the basis of discussions at the Convention on the Future of Europe and became law with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . Ahead of the French referendum on a European Constitution , Schr\u00f6der joined Chirac in urging French voters to back the new treaty , which would have enshrined new rules for the expanded EU of 25 member states and widened the areas of collective action .",
      "Also in 2003 , both Schr\u00f6der and Chirac forced a suspension of sanctions both faced for breaching the European Unions fiscal rules that underpin the euro \u2013 the Stability and Growth Pact \u2013 for three years in a row . Schr\u00f6der later called for a revision of the Lisbon Strategy and thereby a retreat from Europes goal of overtaking the United States as the worlds most competitive economy by 2010 . Instead , he urged the EU to reform the Pact to encourage growth , and to seek the reorientation of the \u20ac100,000,000,000 annual EU budget towards research and innovation . By 2005 , he had successfully pushed for an agreement on sweeping plans to rewrite the Pact , which now allowed EU members with deficits above the original 3% of GDP limit to cite the costs of the reunification of Europe as a mitigating factor .",
      "Schr\u00f6der was regarded a strong ally of Prime Minister Leszek Miller of Poland and supporter of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union . On 1 August 2004 , the sixtieth anniversary of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising , he apologised to Poland for the immeasurable suffering of its people during the conflict ; he was the first German Chancellor to be invited to an anniversary of the uprising . Both Schr\u00f6der and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also supported the accession of Turkey to the European Union .",
      "Foreign policy .",
      "Marking a clear break with the caution of German foreign policy since World War II , Schr\u00f6der laid out in 1999 his vision of the countrys international role , describing Germany as a great power in Europe that would not hesitate to pursue its national interests .",
      "Schr\u00f6der also began seeking a resolution ways to compensate Nazi-era slave labourers almost as soon as he was elected Chancellor . Reversing the hard-line stance of his predecessor , Helmut Kohl , he agreed to the government contributing alongside industry to a fund that would compensate people forced to work in German factories by the Nazi regime and appointed Otto Graf Lambsdorff to represent German industry in the negotiations with survivors organisations , American lawyers and the U.S . government .",
      "Schr\u00f6der sent forces to Kosovo and to Afghanistan as part of NATO operations . Until Schr\u00f6ders chancellorship , German troops had not taken part in combat actions since World War II . In May 2019 at WORLD.MINDS in Belgrade , 20 years to the day after the bombing of Belgrade by NATO troops , Schr\u00f6der stated unequivocally that in retrospect , if he had to make the decision again , he would authorize the aerial bombardment of the former Yugoslavia again . Schr\u00f6der said that the easiest solution would be to first accept Serbia into the European Union and then within , as an integral part the EU , find a solution [ to the Kosovo issue ] . With Germany having a long experience with terrorism itself , Schr\u00f6der declared solidarity with the United States after the September 11 attacks in 2001 . When Schr\u00f6der left office , Germany had 2,000 troops in Afghanistan , the largest contingent from any nation other than the United States , UK , France , Canada and after two years Afghanistan .",
      "Relations with the Middle East",
      "During their time in government , both Schr\u00f6der and his foreign minister Joschka Fischer were widely considered sincerely , if not uncritically , pro-Israel . Schr\u00f6der represented the German government at the funeral service for King Hussein of Jordan in Amman on 9 February 1999 .",
      "When British planes joined United States forces bombing Iraq without consulting the United Nations Security Council in December 1998 , Schr\u00f6der endorsed the military action unequivocally . Along with French President Jacques Chirac and many other world leaders , Schr\u00f6der later spoke out strongly against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and refused any military assistance in that enterprise . Schr\u00f6ders stance caused political friction between the US and Germany , in particular because he used this topic for his 2002 election campaign . Schr\u00f6ders stance set the stage for alleged anti-American statements by members of the SPD . The parliamentary leader of the SPD , Ludwig Stiegler , compared US President George W . Bush to Julius Caesar while Schr\u00f6ders Minister of Justice , Herta D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin , likened Bushs foreign policy to that of Adolf Hitler . Schr\u00f6ders critics accused him of enhancing , and campaigning on , anti-American sentiments in Germany . After his 2002 re-election , Schr\u00f6der and Bush rarely met and their animosity was seen as a widening political gap between the US and Europe . Bush stated in his memoirs that Schr\u00f6der initially promised to support the Iraq war but changed his mind with the upcoming German elections and public opinion strongly against the invasion , to which Schr\u00f6der responded saying that Bush was not telling the truth . When asked in March 2003 if he were at all self-critical about his position on Iraq , Schr\u00f6der replied , I very much regret there were excessive statements from himself and former members of his government ( which capitalised on the wars unpopularity ) .",
      "Relations with Russia",
      "On his first official trip to Russia in late-1998 , Schr\u00f6der suggested that Germany was not likely to come up with more aid for the country . He also sought to detach himself from the close personal relationship that his predecessor , Helmut Kohl , had with Russian President Boris Yeltsin , saying that German-Russian relations should develop independently of concrete political figures . Soon after , however , he cultivated close ties with Yeltsins successor , President Vladimir Putin , in an attempt to strengthen the strategic partnership between Berlin and Moscow , including the opening of a gas pipeline from Russian Dan Marino-Pipelines over the Baltic Sea exclusively between Russia and Germany ( see Gazprom controversy below ) . During his time in office , he visited the country five times .",
      "Schr\u00f6der was criticised in the media , and subsequently by Angela Merkel , for calling Putin a flawless democrat on 22 November 2004 , only days before Putin prematurely congratulated Viktor Yanukovich during the Orange Revolution . In 2005 , Schr\u00f6der suggested at the ceremonial introduction of the Airbus A380 in Toulouse that there was still room in the boat of EADS for Russia .",
      "Only a few days after his chancellorship , Schr\u00f6der joined the board of directors of the Nord Stream joint venture , thus bringing about new speculations about his prior objectivity . In his memoirs Decisions : My Life in Politics , Schr\u00f6der still defends his friend and political ally , and states that it would be wrong to place excessive demands on Russia when it comes to the rate of domestic political reform and democratic development , or to judge it solely on the basis of the Chechnya conflict .",
      "Relations with China",
      "During his time in office , Schr\u00f6der visited China six times . He was the first Western politician to travel to Beijing and apologise after NATO jets had mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999 . In 2004 , he and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao established a secure , direct telephone line . He also pressed for the lifting of the EU arms embargo on China .",
      "Life after politics .",
      "Schr\u00f6der rents an apartment in Berlin while retaining his primary residence in Hanover . As a former Chancellor , he is entitled to a permanent office , also situated in Berlin . In late 2005 , he spent time in the UK improving his English language skills .",
      "Representative role .",
      "After leaving public office , Schr\u00f6der represented Germany at the funeral services for Boris Yeltsin in Moscow ( jointly with Horst K\u00f6hler and Helmut Kohl , 2007 ) and Fidel Castro in Santiago de Cuba ( jointly with Egon Krenz , 2016 ) .",
      "Schr\u00f6der and Kurt Biedenkopf served as mediators in a conflict over privatization plans at German railway operator Deutsche Bahn ; the plans eventually fell through . In 2016 , he was appointed by Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel to mediate ( alongside economist Bert R\u00fcrup ) in a dispute between two of Germanys leading retailers , Edeka and REWE Group , over the takeover of supermarket chain Kaisers Tengelmann .",
      "Following the release of German activist Peter Steudtner from a Turkish prison in October 2017 , German media reported that Schr\u00f6der had acted as mediator in the conflict and , on the request of Gabriel , met with President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to secure the release . After the 2018 elections in Turkey , he represented the German government at Erdo\u011fans swearing-in ceremony in Ankara .",
      "Business activities .",
      "Schr\u00f6ders plans after leaving office as Chancellor and resigning his Bundestag seat included resuming his law practice in Berlin , writing a book , and implementing plans for twin pipelines for Gazprom , Russias leading energy company . He was subsequently retained by the Swiss publisher Ringier AG as a consultant . Other board memberships include the following :",

      "Criticism and controversies .",
      "Relationship with Gazprom and Rosneft .",
      "As Chancellor , Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was a strong advocate of the Nord Stream pipeline project , which now supplies Russian gas directly to Germany , thereby bypassing transit countries .",
      "At the time of the German parliamentary election , according to Rick Noak of The Washington Post :",
      "On 24 October 2005 , just a few weeks before Schr\u00f6der stepped down as Chancellor , the German government guaranteed to cover 1 billion euros of the Nord Stream project cost , should Gazprom default on a loan . However , this guarantee had never been used . Soon after stepping down as chancellor , Schr\u00f6der accepted Gazproms nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders committee of Nord Stream AG , raising questions about a potential conflict of interest .",
      "German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue , as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas is currently pumped . In an editorial entitled Gerhard Schroeders Sellout , the American newspaper The Washington Post also expressed sharp criticism , reflecting widening international ramifications of Schr\u00f6ders new post . Democrat Tom Lantos , chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs , likened Schr\u00f6der to a political prostitute for his recent behaviour . In January 2009 , the Wall Street Journal reported that Schr\u00f6der would join the board of the oil company TNK-BP , a joint venture between oil major BP and Russian partners .",
      "In 2016 , Schr\u00f6der switched to become manager of Nord Stream 2 , an expansion of the original pipeline in which Gazprom is sole shareholder .",
      "In 2017 , Russia nominated Schr\u00f6der to also serve as an independent director of the board of its biggest oil producer Rosneft . At the time , Rosneft was under Western sanctions over Russias role in the Ukraine crisis . Schr\u00f6der told Blick that he would be paid about $350,000 annually for the part-time post . His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad , especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections . German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her predecessor , saying I do not think what Mr Schr\u00f6der is doing is okay .",
      "Defamation lawsuit ( 2002 ) .",
      "In April 2002 , Schr\u00f6der sued the DDP press agency for publishing an opinion of public relations consultant Sabine Schwind saying that he would be more credible if he didnt dye his gray hair . The court decided to ban the media from suggesting that he colours his hair . The Chancellors spokesman said : This is not a frivolous action taken over whether he does or doesnt dye his hair , but is a serious issue regarding his word . The agencys lawyer said that they could not accept a verdict which does not coincide with freedom of the press .",
      "Dispute over Estonian war memorial .",
      "During a heated dispute between Russia and Estonia in May 2007 over the removal of a Soviet-era war memorial from the centre of the Estonian capital Tallinn to a military cemetery , Schr\u00f6der defended the Kremlins reaction . He remarked that Estonia had contradicted every form of civilised behaviour . Consequently , the Estonian government cancelled a planned visit by Schr\u00f6der in his function as chairman of Nord Stream AG , which promotes the petroleum pipeline from Russia to Germany .",
      "Comments on Kosovo independence .",
      "Schr\u00f6der has criticised some European countries swift decision to recognise Kosovo as an independent state after it declared independence in February 2008 . He believes the decision was taken under heavy pressure from the US government and has caused more problems , including the weakening of the so-called pro-EU forces in Serbia . In August 2008 , Schr\u00f6der laid the blame for the 2008 South Ossetia war squarely on Mikhail Saakashvili and the West , hinting at American foreknowledge and refusing to criticize any aspect of Russian policy which had thus far come to light .",
      "Comments on Crimean crisis .",
      "In March 2014 , Schr\u00f6der likened Russias intervention in Crimea with NATOs intervention in Kosovo , citing both cases as violations of international law and the UN Charter . He further stated that there had been unhappy developments on the outskirts of the former Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War , leading Putin to develop justifiable fears about being encircled . On 13 March 2014 , an attempt by the German Green Party to ban Schr\u00f6der from speaking in public about Ukraine was narrowly defeated in the European parliament . His decision to celebrate his 70th birthday party with Putin in Saint Petersburgs Yusupov Palace in late April elicited further criticism from several members of Merkels grand coalition , including human rights spokesperson .",
      "Paradise Papers .",
      "In November 2017 , an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism cited his name in the list of politicians named in Paradise Papers allegations .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Schr\u00f6der has been married five times :",
      "- Eva Schubach ( married 1968 , divorced 1972 ) ;",
      "- Anne Taschenmacher ( married 1972 , divorced 1984 ) ;",

      "When not in Berlin , Schr\u00f6der lives in Hanover . In 2013 , Schr\u00f6der and Kopf purchased another home in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck , Turkey , in a real estate project developed by Nicolas Berggruen .",
      "Schr\u00f6ders fourth marriage has earned him the nickname Audi Man , a reference to the four-ring symbol of Audi motorcars . Another nickname is The Lord of the Rings .",
      "Schr\u00f6der married for the fifth time in 2018 . His wife is the Korean economist and interpreter Kim So-yeon .",
      "Schr\u00f6der identifies himself as a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany , but does not appear to be religious . He did not add the optional phrase So wahr mir Gott helfe ( so help me God ) when sworn in as chancellor for his first term in 1998 .",
      "Schr\u00f6der is known to be an avid art collector . He chose his friend J\u00f6rg Immendorff to paint his official portrait for the German Chancellery . The portrait , which was completed by Immendorffs assistants , was revealed to the public in January 2007 ; the massive work has ironic character , showing the former Chancellor in stern heroic pose , in the colors of the German flag , painted in the style of an icon , surrounded by little monkeys . These painter monkeys were a recurring theme in Immendorffs work , serving as an ironic commentary on the artists practice . On 14 June 2007 , Schr\u00f6der gave a eulogy at a memorial service for Immendorf at the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin .",
      "Awards and honours .",

      "Wilhelm Liebknecht",
      "Wilhelm Martin Philipp Christian Ludwig Liebknecht ( 29 March 1826 \u2013 7 August 1900 ) was a German socialist and one of the principal founders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) . His political career was a pioneering project combining Marxist revolutionary theory with practical legal political activity . Under his leadership , the SPD grew from a tiny sect to become Germanys largest political party . He was the father of Karl Liebknecht and Theodor Liebknecht .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early years .",
      "Wilhelm Liebknecht was born in 1826 in Giessen , the son of Katharina Elisabeth Henrietta ( n\u00e9e Hirsch ) and Hessian public official Ludwig Christian Liebknecht . Liebknecht grew up with relatives after the death of his parents in 1832 . From 1832 to 1842 , he went to school at the Gymnasium of Giessen , then began studying philology , theology and philosophy in Giessen , Berlin and Marburg . He studied the writings of St Simon , from which he gained his first interest in communism , and had been converted to the extreme republican theories of which Giessen was a centre . After some trouble with the authorities as a result of participating in student radicalism , Liebknecht decided to emigrate to the United States .",
      "While on a train to a port city , quite by chance , he met the headmaster of a progressive school in Zurich , Switzerland , and Liebknecht impulsively decided to accept an offer to be an unpaid teacher at that school . Thus he found himself in Switzerland in 1847 as a civil war began in that country . He reported these events for a German newspaper , the Mannheimer Abendzeitung , beginning a career in journalism that he would pursue for the next five decades .",
      "Revolution of 1848 .",
      "When revolution erupted in Paris in February 1848 , Liebknecht hurried to the scene . He arrived too late to do much in Paris , but he did join a legion that was traveling to Germany to instigate revolution there . During that poorly planned expedition , he was arrested in Baden and charged with treason . On the eve of his trial , revolution erupted once more , and a mob secured his release . He then became a member of the Badische Volkswehr and an adjutant of Gustav von Struve and fought in the ill-fated Reichverfassungsk\u00e4mpfe ( federal constitution wars ) . After the revolutionaries defeat , he escaped to Switzerland and became a leading member of the Genfer Arbeiterverein ( Workers Association of Geneva ) , where he met Friedrich Engels .",
      "Years of exile .",
      "In 1850 , Liebknecht was arrested for his initiatives to unite Switzerlands German workers associations and was banished from the country . With few options available , like many veterans of the recently failed revolution , he relocated his exile to London , where he stayed from 1850 to 1862 . There he became a member of the Communist League . During these years , he developed a lifelong friendship and collaboration with Karl Marx . In 1862 , after an amnesty for the participants in the revolution of 1848 , he returned to Germany and became a member of Ferdinand Lassalles General German Workers Association ( Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein , ADAV ) , the precursor of the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) .",
      "Return to Germany .",
      "From 1864 to 1865 , Liebknecht also worked for the magazine Der Social-Demokrat ( The Social Democrat ) published by Jean Baptista von Schweitzer . However , he soon found himself in disagreement with the papers friendly position toward Prussia and its new Minister-President Otto von Bismarck . So Liebknecht quit the editorial staff and was forced to leave the ADAV due to pressure from Schweitzer . After being evicted from Berlin by government authorities , Liebknecht moved to Leipzig where he met August Bebel , with whom he founded the S\u00e4chsische Volkspartei ( Saxon Peoples Party ) in 1867 and the Social Democratic Workers Party of Germany ( Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands , SDAP ) in 1869 in Eisenach . During these years , he was elected to the national legislature , where he conducted a determined but futile opposition to Bismarcks policies . Liebknecht was also the editor of the party newspaper , Der Volksstaat ( The Peoples State ) .",
      "When the Franco-Prussian War began in 1870 , Liebknecht used his newspaper to agitate against the war , calling on working men on both sides of the border to unite in overthrowing the ruling class . As a result , he and Bebel were arrested and charged with treason . It is worth noting that Liebknecht opposed the war regardless of which side started it . His call for revolutionary opposition to the war directly contradicts what his party ( the SPD ) would do in 1914 when World War I began as at that time , with Liebknecht long dead , his successors opted to back the German cause in the war .",
      "Treason trial .",
      "In 1872 , both Liebknecht and Bebel were convicted and sentenced to two years of ( imprisonment in a fortress ) . This was one of sixteen times that Liebknechts politics resulted in his conviction and incarceration .",
      "Return to politics .",
      "After being re-elected to the Reichstag in 1874 , Liebknecht played a key role in the merger of the SDAP and Lassalles ADAV into the Socialist Workers Party of Germany ( Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands , SAPD ) in Gotha in 1875 . He also became publisher of the newly founded party organ Vorw\u00e4rts ( Forward ) , arguing for the integration of Marxist theories into the SAPDs program in his articles .",
      "From 1878 to 1890 , the German government outlawed Liebknechts party , but the terms of the law allowed the party to participate in elections and its elected delegates to participate in the Reichstag . Liebknecht used his position as a Reichstag member to criticize the political situation and opposed the tendencies in his own party toward anarchism on the one hand and accommodation with Bismarck on the other . Maintaining a radical and unified stance , the SPD emerged from outlawry in 1890 with 20% of the vote in the Reichstag election .",
      "In 1891 , Liebknecht became editor-in-chief of Vorw\u00e4rts and one of the originators of the SPDs new Marxist-inspired party platform . Throughout that decade , he continued to serve in the Reichstag and to appear at political conventions of the SPD as a prominent referent . Despite his advanced age , he also was a major organizer of the Second Socialist International .",
      "Death and legacy .",
      "Liebknecht died aged 74 on 7 August 1900 in Charlottenburg , a suburb of Berlin . 50,000 people joined his funeral procession .",

      "United States Air Forces in Europe \u2013 Air Forces Africa",
      "The United States Air Forces in Europe \u2013 Air Forces Africa ( USAFE-AFAFRICA ) is a United States Air Force major command ( MAJCOM ) and a component command of both United States European Command ( USEUCOM ) and United States Africa Command ( USAFRICOM ) . As part of its mission , USAFE-AFAFRICA commands U.S . Air Force units pledged to NATO , maintaining combat-ready wings based from Great Britain to Turkey . USAFE-AFAFRICA plans , conducts , controls , coordinates and supports air and space operations in Europe , parts of Asia and all of Africa with the exception of Egypt to achieve U.S . national and NATO objectives based on taskings by the two combatant commanders .",
      "USAFE-AFAFRICA is headquartered at Ramstein Air Base , Germany . It is the oldest continuously active USAF major command , originally activated on 1 February 1942 at Langley Field , Virginia , as the Eighth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces . Two years later , it was designated as United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe ( USSTAF ) and on 7 August 1945 it was designated as United States Air Forces in Europe ( USAFE ) . On 20 April 2012 it formally assumed its current designation when the 17th Air Force inactivated .",
      "The command has more than 35,000 active duty personnel , Air Reserve Component personnel , and civilian employees assigned .",
      "Origins .",
      "The origins of USAFE can be traced to 19 January 1942 , with the establishment of Eighth Air Force . Eighth Air Force was activated on 28 January at Savannah Army Air Base , Georgia . On 5 May , Major General Carl Spaatz assumed command of HQ Eighth Air Force . On 8 January , the order activating the U.S . Air Forces in the British Isles ( USAFBI ) was announced . On 12 May , the first contingent of USAAF personnel arrived in England to join the Eighth Air Force . On 15 June , Spaatz arrived in England to establish Headquarters , Eighth Air Force at Bushy Park , west-south-west of London .",
      "Eighth Air Force controlled :",
      "- VIII Bomber Command ( Established 19 January 1942 )",
      "- VIII Fighter Command ( Established 19 January 1942 )",
      "- VIII Air Support Command ( Established 24 April 1942 )",
      "- VIII Air Service Command ( Established 1942 , name changed to VIII Air Force Service Command by 1943 )",
      "On 22 February 1944 , the Army Air Forces reorganized its commands in Europe . Eighth Air Force was redesignated as United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe ( USSTAF ) and VIII Bomber Command was redesignated as Eighth Air Force .",
      "On 7 August 1945 , USSTAF was redesignated as United States Air Forces in Europe ( USAFE ) . Its headquarters was relocated from Saint Germain-en-Laye , France , to Lindsey Air Station , Wiesbaden , Germany , on 28 September 1945 . Within 18 months of VE-Day , virtually all U.S . armed forces personnel had left Europe except for the Occupation Forces in Germany , Austria , and a small number of Army troops in Trieste . USAFE had been reduced from a force of 17,000 aircraft and about 500,000 personnel to about 2,000 aircraft and 75,000 personnel . USAFEs four wartime Air Forces were demobilized or reassigned between August and December 1945 . In March 1946 USAFE was given the status of a Major Command ( MAJCOM ) .",
      "A major postwar mission for USAFE was Operation Lusty , in which former Luftwaffe jet aircraft , such as the Messerschmitt Me 262A and Heinkel He 162A were located on various airfields around Munich and shipped to the United States for inspection and evaluation . At Lechfeld Air Base near Augsburg , large numbers of Me 262s were discovered , and valuable German air-to-air rockets . At the Oberpfaffenhofen air base near Munich \u2014 the former Dornier factory airfield , and today the home of Germanys DLR aerospace research facility \u2014 USAFE found a high-speed Dornier Do 335 . This propeller-driven aircraft could reach a speed of 760 km/h , about 100 km slower than the Me 262 jet fighter . Other former Luftwaffe aircraft were collected and simply sent to blast furnaces for metal recycling .",
      "In March 1947 , General Joseph T . McNarney , Commanding General , U.S . Forces , European Theatre , told the War Department all he needed was an Air Force of about 7,500 [ men ] to provide air transport and communications . He had no need for combat units , which he described as an administrative burden , and he wanted them withdrawn . Nobody in Washington objected . Thus , the XII Tactical Air Command , the now USAFE combat organization after the inactivation of the four Air Forces , was inactivated on 10 May 1947 . By this time , USAFEs fighting force appears to have dropped to a single unit , the 86th Fighter Group , which was shuffled around three separate stations in Germany in 1946\u201347 as it absorbed the inactivating personnel and equipment of first the 406th Fighter Group and then the 33rd Fighter Group .",
      "In 1945 IX Air Force Service Command was reassigned from Ninth Air Force to USSTAF ( about the date IX ASC moved to Erlangen ) . On 7 October 1946 , IX ASC was redesignated European Air Materiel Command . This command administered USAFEs supply and maintenance depots . EAMC was headquartered at Erlangen Air Depot . At Erding Air Depot , it had Detachment B , 4th Air Vehicle Repair Squadron , and the 43d Air Depot . The 10th Air Depot was located at Oberpfaffenhofen Air Depot . The 862d Engineer Aviation Battalion and 837th Engineer Aviation Battalion were located at Landsberg . At Industriehafen Air Depot was Detachment A , 42d Air Repair Squadron . Minor EAMC facilities were located at Bad Wiesse , Wolfgang , Munich , Bruck , Oberwiesenfeld and Bremerhaven . EAMC also controlled ammunition depots at Landesberg , Roth and Zepplenheim . EAMC remained assigned to USAFE until it was inactivated on 15 September 1947 .",
      "European Air Transport Service .",
      "The European Air Transport Service ( EATS ) , built around the 51st Troop Carrier Wing , controlled C-46 , Douglas C-47 Skytrain and C-54 transport aircraft and provided passenger and cargo transport within Western Europe . Its headquarters was at Wiesbaden . It initially controlled the former IX Troop Carrier Command squadrons which remained after the war . EATS operated both cargo and personnel transport routes in non-Communist controlled areas to support the American , British and French occupation forces , along with units in Greece ( Athens Airport ) and Italy .",
      "Known EATS facilities were :",
      "- Bremen Airfield",
      "- Capodichino Air Base , Naples",
      "- Eschborn Airfield",
      "- Munich-Riem Airfield",
      "- Pisa Air Base , Italy",
      "- Rhein-Main Airfield",
      "- Tullin Airfield , Austria",
      "- Wiesbaden Airfield",
      "There were also EATS terminals and detachments at Tempelhof Airport , West Berlin , RAF Bovingdon , Hertfordshire , UK , and Paris-Orly Airfield , France .",
      "Beginning of the Cold War .",
      "An uneasy peace .",
      "Concerned about the massive drawdown of USAFE and the United States Army Europe ( USAREUR ) , the U.S . member of the Allied High Commission for Germany , John J . McCloy , had grave concerns that the troops available would be insufficient to ensure a peaceful transition in the American Zone . The United States European wartime allies , Britain and France , had also rapidly demobilized .",
      "In preparation for the future , the RAF and USAFE began a series of mapping flights over Soviet-controlled territory in Germany that led to numerous skirmishes and high tensions . Between the autumn of 1945 and 1947 , mapped areas in west and central Europe , North Africa and the Atlantic Islands on a large scale in Operation Casey Jones . Casey Jones flights were made by reconnaissance variant RB-24 Liberators ( the former F-7 variant ) and RB-17 Flying Fortresses ( formerly called the F-9 ) . These flights were only supposed to be flown over the Western Allies occupation zones , but there is a strong suspicion that these aircraft also operated over the Soviet zone . Soviet fighters regularly opened fire on American aircraft operating over their occupation zone . On 22 April 1946 , a Douglas C-47 near the Tulln Air Base near Vienna over the Soviet zone of Austria was attacked by Soviet Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters . On 9 August , Yugoslavian fighters opened fire on another USAAF C-47 and forced it to land .",
      "Rotation of strategic bombers through Europe .",
      "Soviet activity in Eastern Europe unsettled the western allies . President Harry S . Truman decided to take a hard line with Russia , lest the situation evolve into a new war . In Germany , F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base near Munich , Giebelstadt near W\u00fcrzburg , and Rhein-Main near Frankfurt were rebuilt to accommodate Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers . Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) wanted its B-29 fleet as close to the Soviet Union as possible because of their limited range and it was decided to rotate a portion of SACs B-29 fleet through Europe . In November 1946 , six B-29 bombers from SACs 43d Bombardment Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base , Arizona were deployed to RAF Burtonwood , England and from there to various bases in Germany as a training deployment . The B-29s were flown to bases in France , Turkey , Greece and were flown along the borders of Bulgaria and Russia over the Black Sea as part of show the flag operations . In May 1947 , SAC began additional training deployments that stationed a number of B-29s in Germany at Giebelstadt and F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck . These B-29 squadrons were constantly rotated back to the United States . being replaced with new squadrons in rotation . SAC also deployed B-29s to the United Kingdom where they were rotated through RAF Marham , RAF Waddington , RAF Scampton and RAF Lakenheath .",
      "The United States also provided military aid to the Greek Air Force to help the nation resist the communists . AT-6 Texan trainers and C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft , along with armored vehicles , small arms weapons , munitions and radar were provided . In Turkey , various intelligence gathering aircraft were deployed along the northern Black Sea coast , providing the United States intelligence about the Soviet Republics of Armenia and Georgia . Overflights of the Soviet Union were also performed .",
      "The Berlin Airlift .",
      "The Berlin Airlift was one of the defining events of and marked the beginning of the Cold War . The 464-day effort to supply a citys needs solely through the air demonstrated the resolve of Western nations to maintain influence in Berlin . The massive humanitarian effort was an early triumph for allied air forces , and symbolized Western commitment to anti-Communist efforts in Europe after World War II .",
      "In 1945 the Soviets , Americans , British and French divided Germany into occupation zones . Berlin , although in the Soviet zone , also was divided among the four powers . On 18 June 1948 , the three Western sectors agreed on a new common German currency , coming into force on 20 June , that ended the use of occupation currency and introduced the Deutsche Mark . The Soviets considered this move a breach of agreements reached at the 1945 Potsdam Conference , which stated that Germany would be treated as one economic unit . In response to the currency reform action by the West , on 23 June the Soviets cut off electrical power to a large part of the western sectors of Berlin . The next day , 24 June the Soviet Union blocked western all road , rail and barge access through the Soviet occupation zone of Germany to the three Western-held sectors of Berlin , beginning the Berlin Blockade . The Soviets also now rejected western arguments of their occupation rights in Berlin , and legal claims to unimpeded use of the highways and railroads to the city .",
      "USAF mobilization .",
      "After discussion of military options , the priority was given to supplying Berlin by air , as the Soviet blockade had little effect on the three Berlin air corridors . The Soviet Union did not initially interfere with the cargo aircraft flying the Berlin Airlift , as they were convinced that supplying two million Berliners by air was an impossible task . In 1948 , USAFE strength was limited . The command consisted of 485 aircraft , with the 60th and 61st Troop Carrier Groups at Rhein-Main and Wiesbaden Air Bases near Frankfurt , both flying C-47s . The only other flying unit was the 86th Fighter Group at Neubiberg Air Base near Munich , with P-47s , which had been activated on 1 July 1948 .",
      "On the morning of 26 June , two days after the blockade began , the first C-47 loaded with milk and medicine took off from Wiesbaden Air Base for Tempelhof Air Base in Berlin . A total of 32 flights were made on that first day . Yet it would take many hundreds of cargo flights each day to provide the 12,000 tons of food , fuel , clothing and medicine it was estimated was necessary to sustain the two million people of western Berlin . There were simply not enough C-47s available , as it was estimated that over 900 would be needed to fly the necessary tonnage to Berlin each day . However , if the larger C-54 Skymaster was used , about 180 could supply the cargo necessary . However , there simply werent that many aircraft available . The Military Air Transport Service ( MATS ) was ordered to mobilize all available C-54s and C-82 wherever they could in the world to support the airlift , and to refurbish as many as possible of the C-47s in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB for airlift duty . The C-74 Globemaster was also considered for use , as its massive cargo carrying capacity would drastically reduce the number of flights and aircraft necessary . However , the aircrafts landing requirements far exceeded what was available in Berlin , and it was unsafe to land it on the short runways . The C-74 , however did fly cargo from the United States to staging bases in Europe .",
      "To increase USAFEs tactical air strength , in July 1948 75 Lockheed F-80s were transferred to Germany with the 36th Fighter Group , being assigned to F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base , near Munich . This move considerably increased USAFEs tactical airpower , but also was considered as having great psychological value .",
      "In August 1948 , 10 C-54s arrived in Germany to begin airlift service . In addition , civilian DC-4s were loaned to the Air Force for airlift duty . The United States Navy provided 21 R-5Ds , their version of the C-54 as well . The airfields at Rhein-Main and Wiesbaden began to fill to capacity with planes , and the decision was made to also use Royal Air Force airfields at Celle and Fa\u00dfberg . The U.S . Air Force , the U.S . Navy , and the British Royal Air Force together airlifted more than 2.3 million tons of food , fuel and medical supplies . Most of the tonnage was carried by the U.S . Air Force . The Berlin Airlift taxed existing USAF resources of cargo aircraft , aircraft engines , skilled aircrews , and maintenance personnel .",
      "Strategic Air Command reassessed its B-29 forward deployments after the Berlin crisis arose . After initial forward deployments to Goose Bay Air Base in Newfoundland , and consideration of basing the bombers in Germany , it was decided to send them to Royal Air Force bases in Britain where they would be less vulnerable . The 28th and 307th Bombardment Groups were deployed to the newly activated station at RAF Marham .",
      "Soviet reaction .",
      "After a few months it was clear to the Soviets that the Americans were succeeding in supplying the western sectors of Berlin with the minimal amount of supplies necessary to sustain it . Mock attacks by Soviet Air Force fighters begun in the air corridors to scare the American pilots caused great confusion and considerably increased the danger of air collisions . Also as many Yakovlev and Lavochkin fighters as possible were assembled around Berlin and then flown en masse in a westerly direction though the corridors . Near the western border of the Soviet occupation zone , they peeled off and flew along the zone border to the next corridor so they could fly back to Berlin along it , against the traffic , to their airfields around Berlin . Western radio frequencies were jammed and chaff was released to confuse radar operators . Searchlights were shone on aircraft in the corridors at night . By the spring of 1949 , USAFE announced that there were incidents of Soviets firing at cargo aircraft with anti-aircraft artillery , and of barrage balloons being allowed to float within the corridors . No serious aircraft accidents occurred as a result .",
      "The efforts of many hundreds of pilots and the many thousands of military and German civilians involved in the airlift kept the people of Berlin supplied . On one day , the Berlin Airlift delivered nearly 13,000 tons of provisions with almost 1,400 flights . So great was the stream of aircraft that an aircraft landed almost once a minute at one of the three western Berlin airfields . The continuous engine noise of the aircraft stream of heavy transports not only made an impression on the citizens of Berlin , but on the Soviet Union .",
      "The Soviet Union came to realize that the blockade of Berlin would not achieve the desired political effect they wished . On 12 May 1949 , the Soviet blockade was lifted . However airlift operated at a reduced level until the end of September to ensure adequate supplies were available in Berlin in case of a re-imposition of the blockade .",
      "The 1950s .",
      "Even with the Korean War raging in the early 1950s , Europe received a higher priority of air power than Korea by the Truman Administration and the Department of Defense . In September 1950 , the NATO Military Committee called for an ambitious buildup of conventional forces to meet the Soviets , subsequently reaffirming this position at the February 1952 meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon . This meeting established a goal of ultimately fielding 96 divisions in the event of a conventional war in 1954 . As part of this buildup USAFE was intended to expand from 16 wings totaling 2,100 aircraft , to 28 wings , 22 of them in the Allied Forces Central Europe area alone , backed by deployed Strategic Air Command units sent from the United States .",
      "The USAF transferred thirteen combat wings from Tactical Air Command plus one air depot wing from Air Material Command , and relocated the units to USAFE during the period from April 1951 through December 1954 . Eight wings were regular Air Force wings , four wings were federalized Air National Guard units , and one wing was a mobilized Air Force Reserve unit . Four of these wings deployed to the United Kingdom , three into West Germany , and six wings were deployed to France . These wings numbered approximately 500 fighters , 100 light bombers , 100 tactical reconnaissance aircraft , 100 tactical airlift transports , and 18,000 personnel .",
      "Along with these new units from the United States , USAFE moved its forces in West Germany to the west of the River Rhine . Existing bases in Bavaria ( Erding Air Depot , F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck , Landsberg , Kaufbeuren and Neubiberg Air Bases ) were deemed too vulnerable to Soviet attack and were closed by 1960 .",
      "On 1 March 1954 , Air Materiel Force , European Area was activated at Lindsey Air Station and assigned to USAFE . However , Air Materiel Command finally attained global responsibility for USAF logistics support , and AMF , European Area was transferred to it on 1 January 1956 . As part of this realignment , HQ Spain Air Material Area was also reassigned to AMF , European Area . AMC moved AMF European Area to Chateauroux Air Station in May 1958 .",
      "From 1954 , USAFE built up a large training organization with the primary mission of training the new West German Luftwaffe . Training squadrons were first expanded to groups and then quickly expanded into wings ( 3-4 groups ) . In June 1955 , the 7330th Flying Training Wing was organized . The 7351st Flight Training Group was redesignated as a wing . The 7331st Technical Training Group was reorganized as a wing in April 1955 at Kaufbeuren Air Base . Because building the German Air Force was a high priority , a new supervisory headquarters was required . On 1 July 1955 the USAFE Training Headquarters , Provisional , was established , responsible for the three GAF training wings .",
      "In 1955 , the force structure was as follows :",
      "- United Kingdom :",
      "- West Germany:***",
      "- France : ( See United States Air Force in France )",
      "- Netherlands :",
      "Erding , Landsberg , and Neubiberg Air Bases , although nominally under USAF control , were being used to train West German Luftwaffe pilots . When training was complete , the bases were turned over to West German control . The last of these bases were turned over by 1960 . Erding Air Base was shared by USAFE interceptors briefly in the early 1970s .",
      "By 1960 , USAFE controlled additional air bases in French Morocco , Libya , Saudi Arabia , Greece , Turkey , Italy , and Spain .",
      "On 4 November 1956 , Soviet troops invaded Hungary , after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution . In response , the United States deployed sixteen Convair B-36 Peacemaker bombers to RAF Burtonwood in the United Kingdom . It is still unknown if the B-36s were armed with nuclear weapons . Several temporary SAC Reflex deployments of B-47 bombers were also made to bases in the United Kingdom and North Africa .",
      "The 1960s .",
      "1961 Berlin Crisis .",
      "The 1961 Berlin Crisis became USAFEs first test of what was known as a Flexible Response strategy . In the spring of 1961 , Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev decided that the Soviet Union would sign a peace treaty with the East German government . In effect the German Democratic Republic would control the Russian zone of Berlin and could end joint occupation of the city . This action was a clear violation of the Potsdam Agreement of 1945 .",
      "When the Western allies objected to this proposed peace treaty , Khrushchev began speaking about restricting the Wests aerial access to Berlin and preventing the entry of East Germans into the city . This possibility started an exodus of Germans from the eastern zone as they rushed to leave their sector and relocate in West Germany .",
      "Departures snowballed from a few dozen refugees daily to a flow of 4,000 per day by August 1961 . On the night of 12 August 1961 the Soviet backed East German government began erecting the Berlin Wall to prevent this flow of workers from communism , precipitating a new Cold War crisis that had been brewing for the previous twelve months . Berlin became a divided city . The response agreed to by the Kennedy Administration was to rapidly increase tactical airpower in Europe during the summer of 1961 .",
      "The Air Force responded with a two-phase deployment of reinforcements to Europe \u2013 the largest such overseas movement of aircraft since World War II . The first phase began on 5 September with Operation Tack Hammer . Tactical Air Command launched eight F-100D squadrons from its Composite Air Strike Force to augment USAFE strength with 144 fighters . All Tack Hammer fighters moved across the Atlantic Ocean with aerial refueling en route . The TACK HAMMER deployment was an interim measure until ANG units could relieve Tactical Air Command squadrons . The Air National Guard was tasked to supply six tactical fighter wings and one tactical reconnaissance wing to expand USAFE . Also deployed to Europe was the ANG 152d Tactical Control Group consisting of six Tactical Control Squadrons , manned by 230 officers and 1,850 airmen with mobile ground radar and radio equipment to control tactical air power on the battlefield . It was dispersed throughout West Germany .",
      "The second phase began with the movement of eleven Air National Guard squadrons in late October and November 1961 . Operation Stair Step was the code name for the rapid aerial movement of the fighters to Europe . Aircraft supplied by ANG wings totaled one hundred tour F-84Es , twenty RF-84Fs , seventy-eight F-86Hs , and seventy-two F-104As . The majority of the fighters arrived on 4 November and amazingly had no losses en route . The F-84E and F-86Fs were considered old and obsolete aircraft even though they were only seven to nine years out of the factory . The three F-104 squadrons were activated on 1 November 1961 . They disassembled their Starfighters and loaded them into Military Air Transport Service C-124s which delivered them to air bases in Germany and Spain .",
      "The primary combat mission of the STAIR STEP units was air superiority and offensive tactical air support operations using conventional munitions to defend West Germany if a war developed over Berlin access . Upon arrival in Europe their missions consisted of command inspections , theater flying training , air-ground close support operations , gunnery training , photo missions , and air defense alert duty . Though equipped with conventional weapons , the STAIR STEP F-84F and F-86H squadrons maintained their proficiency to deliver nuclear weapons by practicing toss bombing . By March 1962 , the Berlin Crisis was subsiding and plans were being made for departure of the ANG wings from Europe . Units were to return all personnel , equipment , and aircraft to CONUS by 1 September 1962 for early release from active duty .",
      "However , the Berlin Wall was built and a barbed wire fence with minefields extended the entire north\u2013south length of a divided Germany . The wall effectively isolated East Germany for the next twenty-eight years . But the American , British , and French Zones still remained in Berlin and access to the city was not challenged again . TACK HAMMER and STAIR STEP forces had served their purpose ; their rapid deployment to France had unequivocally demonstrated the United States determination to defend Berlin .",
      "Beginning about 1963 due to the Vietnam War , USAFE/NATOs total strength steadily declined , as the U.S . reduced forces in Europe to fight a limited war in Southeast Asia for ten years .",
      "French withdrawal from NATOs military structure .",
      "On 7 March 1966 , French President Charles de Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATOs integrated military structure . He gave NATO forces one year ( until 1 April 1967 ) to depart France . The United States Department of State , Department of Defense , and Air Force carefully managed the news about the American departure from France , and the attendant problems of an integrated NATO air defense for western Europe and the decrease in tactical airpower . However , the news media were focusing on Vietnam , so the removal of NATO forces from France went virtually unreported in the US .",
      "During 1966\u201367 all USAF offices and facilities in France were closed and personnel and equipment moved to other NATO countries . The last USAFE activities were the 1630th Air Base Squadron at Orly Airport and the Paris Administration Office . Both were closed in June 1967 . A C-47 variant , the C-117B Super Skytrain , was the last USAF aircraft to depart France on 31 May 1967 . With the French departure , a major reorganization of USAFE was needed . The 49th TFWs three squadrons at Spangdahlem Air Base , and the 417th TFS of the 50th TFW at Hahn Air Base , were recalled to the US . Although the squadrons were relocated to the US , they were still part of USAFEs permanent force . According to the Department of Defense , these squadrons were dual-based ; they could return to their European bases at any given moment without lengthy preparations being necessary .",
      "During 1967 , the 49th TFWs three squadrons flew back to the US where they were stationed at Holloman Air Force Base , New Mexico . The 417th TFS did not return to the US until 1968 , when the squadron was stationed at Mountain Home AFB , Idaho . In 1968 , the four squadrons switched over completely to McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IID fighter-bombers and then undertook intensive preparations for their new role within USAFE . The primary task of the four dual-based squadrons was to carry out Project Crested Cap . Crested Cap was the Air Force part of the Armys Exercise REFORGER , during which Army and Air Force units from the U.S . mainland would be deployed to Europe for Allied Forces Central Europe exercises . Most of the heavy equipment such as armoured vehicles , artillery , etc. , were shipped by sea to exercise that transportation component . Troops were flown via military and contract transport aircraft .",
      "Although the withdrawal of USAFE forces from France was completed in 1967 , it took until the mid-1970s until USAFE fully realigned its forces in Europe . Zweibr\u00fccken AB in West Germany and RAF Upper Heyford in England came under USAFE control within the next several years . Older reconnaissance and fighter aircraft were redeployed from France to Southeast Asia to supplement the U.S . Pacific Air Forces engaged in the Vietnam War .",
      "USAFE in Spain .",
      "Before Spain joined NATO in 1982 , the USAF had for many years used Spanish air bases . Initially used primarily by the Strategic Air Command , they were Mor\u00f3n Air Base , at Mor\u00f3n near Sevilla in southern Spain , and Torrej\u00f3n Air Base at Torrej\u00f3n near Madrid .",
      "The Spanish air bases were important for reinforcing USAFE via the southern Atlantic route . Aircraft that flew to Europe via Lajes Field in the Azores always made a refueling stop at Mor\u00f3n , and later at Torrejon as well . These bases also had American facilities for carrying out aircraft maintenance and repairs . Yet it was primarily the good weather that drew USAFE to Spain for weapons training , which at that time was still mainly held in Libya utilizing the ranges at Wheelus Air Base .",
      "After June 1960 , when SACs 65th Air Division was transferred to USAFE , the footprint of USAFEs activities in Spain increased significantly . Two interceptor squadrons equipped with F-102 Delta Daggers were formed , the 431st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron ( 431 FIS ) being stationed at Zaragoza Air Base and the 497th FIS at Torrejon AB . As compensation for the permanent use of these Spanish bases , the CASA aircraft factory at Mor\u00f3n AB was brought in to maintain the F-102A air defense fighters that the USAFE had stationed in Spain , Germany and the Netherlands .",
      "As the American-Libyan relationship worsened throughout the second half of the 1960s , a growing number of USAFE fighter-bomber squadrons in England and Germany went to Zaragoza and gunnery ranges in Spain for weapons training . Zaragoza later became an important weapons training site for the USAFE and was also visited by F-15 Eagle squadrons for Dissimilar Air Combat Training . During these air combat training exercises , the F-15s often practiced against Spanish Air Force Dassault Mirage F-1 fighters .",
      "In April 1966 , the 16th Air Force was transferred from SAC to the USAFE , with USAFE taking control of the Spanish air bases at Zaragoza and Mor\u00f3n . Under USAFE , the Spanish bases became host to a growing number of deployments from CONUS . Mor\u00f3n received regular visits from Lockheed F-104C Starfighters of the 479th TFW from George AFB , California . During the Cuban Missile Crisis , a squadron of F-104Cs was stationed at Mor\u00f3n . Concern at the height of the crisis led to these aircraft being transferred to Hahn Air Base in West Germany , where they strengthened the air defense of central Europe . Some time later , when the crisis had passed , the aircraft returned to the US via Mor\u00f3n . On 1 April 1963 , their place was taken by F-105D Thunderchief fighter-bombers from the 4th TFW at Seymour Johnson AFB , North Carolina .",
      "During the mid-1960s , the 16th Air Force also gradually took over responsibility for all USAFE operations around the Mediterranean .",
      "USAFE in Turkey .",
      "The U.S . Logistics Group ( TUSLOG ) was the primary USAF agency in Turkey . TUSLOG not only commanded various USAFE units , but also supported all other U.S . military organizations and government agencies in Turkey . TUSLOG was established in 1955 and was headquartered in the Turkish capital of Ankara . The 39th Air Base Wing at Incirlik Air Base near Adana supported training deployments and regional exercises ; communications for National Command Authority taskings ; providing support for various units and an Air Mobility Command tenant unit providing air transport of passengers and cargo . From the 1950s \u2013 1970s , the 39th supported various SAC activities in Turkey , which used Incirlik intensively as a base for U-2 reconnaissance flights along the Soviet border and in the Middle East .",
      "In Ankara , the 7217th Air Base Group managed the logistical support for more than 40 units and agencies , as well as the needs of the American Embassy and U.S . Defense Attach\u00e9 Office . From Izmir Air Station , the 7266th Air Base Group supported the two NATO headquarters , Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe ( LANDSOUTHEAST ) and the Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force ( 6 ATAF ) . The 7241st Air Base Group was the only U.S . military unit in Turkey not located at a single site , but was scattered about \u0130zmir in various locations .",
      "In 1966 , Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield began a campaign to unilaterally reduce U.S . troop levels in Europe . Following this , Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford initiated a program for the Reduction of Costs and Forces in Europe ( REDCOSTE ) in 1968 . Although a change in administrations occurred in the same year , this program conformed to the Nixon Administration policy of lowering the profile of American forces abroad . Consequently , the U.S . began to eliminate or consolidate many of its operations in Turkey . Between 1969 and 1973 , sites at Samsun and Trabzon were turned over to the Turkish government . In addition , Cigli Air Base , which since 1963 had been used by USAF rotational squadrons , was turned over to the Turkish Air Force in 1970 . The U.S . continued , however , to fund the maintenance of numerous facilities there . Altogether , between 1967 and 1970 , the number of Americans in Turkey dropped from 24,000 to 15,000 .",
      "The cutbacks in forces in Turkey naturally had a major effect on TUSLOG . The headquarters in Ankara shrank to a fraction of its former size . On 9 September , it was inactivated as the 7217th Air Division and the next day reestablished as Detachment 1 of Headquarters , Sixteen Air Force .",
      "The 1970s and 1980s .",
      "Changes continued through the early 1970s . Headquarters USAFE transferred from Lindsey Air Station , Germany , to Ramstein Air Base in March 1973 and NATOs Allied Air Forces Central Europe was established at Ramstein Air Base in June 1974 . The USAFE commander in chief then took command of Allied Air Forces Central Europe , in addition to commanding U.S . Air Force units in Europe .",
      "In 1976 , the new McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle air superiority fighter was introduced into USAFE service . The Soviet Unions new MiG and Sukhoi fighters made the U.S . Department of Defense anxious . The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 Foxbat made them pull out all the stops to get the F-15A into USAFE . The F-15A was deployed to Germany in April 1977 with the 36th TFW at Bitburg Air Base West Germany . The 32nd TFS at Soesterberg AB Netherlands was also upgraded to the McDonnell-Douglas F-15A Eagle as part of Project Ready Eagle . By 1986 , all USAFE F-4 wings were replaced by F-15 and F-16 fighters . The 36th TFWs existing F-4E Phantoms were incorporated into three new USAFE squadrons which were established at Hahn Air Base ( 313th TFS ) , Spangdahlem Air Base ( 480th TFS ) and Ramstein Air Base ( 512th TFS ) . Preparations for the switch to the F-15 went ahead at full speed . Its introduction to the USAFE was given the project name `Ready Eagle and , naturally , included transition training for the USAFE pilots .",
      "This retraining was the joint responsibility of USAFE and TAC and first began in January 1976 at Langley AFB , Virginia , where the 1st TFW , was stationed . At Langley AFB , the USAFEs future F-15 pilots were given a crash course that familiarized them with the new aircraft in a relatively short time . The first F-15As arrived at Bitburg AB on 7 January 1977 . These were two TF-15A ( later redesignated as F-15B ) trainers that had flown non-stop from Langley AFB in seven and a half hours .",
      "These Eagles were to be used primarily for ground crew familiarization in anticipation of the arrival of the 525th TFSs first F-15As . The 23 aircraft for this first operational squadron left Langley AFB on 27 April 1977 for a mass Atlantic crossing . Over the following months , the aircraft for two other squadrons ( 22nd TFS and 53rd TFS ) arrived . The 36th TFWs full strength of 79 fully operational F-15As was reached in December 1977 . Project Ready Eagle was completed in precisely one year .",
      "However , after flying the F15A and F-15B for just 18 months , the USAFE exchanged these models for the newer F-15C and F-15D Eagles . In May 1980 , the 32d flew five of its F-15A/B Eagles to Eglin AFB , Florida to participate in the weapons systems evaluation program . While at Eglin AFB , the united swapped its aircraft for the newer models . These planes arrived at Soesterberg AB on 13 June , making the 32d the first unit in the USAFE to be equipped with the latest versions of the F-15 . The 32nd completed the upgrade on 25 November 1980 . At that time the squadron possessed eighteen F-15C and two twin-seat F-15D fighter aircraft .",
      "SS-20s pointing at Europe .",
      "By 1975 , NATO had lost its strategic nuclear lead over the Soviet Union and with the introduction of the Soviet RT-21M Pioneer ( NATO designation SS-20 Saber ) had even fallen behind . NATOs answer was not long in coming and on 12 December 1979 , NATO decided to deploy 572 new nuclear missiles in Europe : 108 Pershing II missiles to be operated by the U.S . Army and 464 BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles , also known as the Gryphon and based on the U.S . Navys nuclear Tomahawk Land Attack Missile ( TLAM-N ) , to be operated by the USAF . Of the cruise missiles , 160 were stationed in England , 96 in West Germany , 112 in Italy , 48 in the Netherlands , and 48 in Belgium . All 108 Pershings were stationed in West Germany . The second significant aspect of the NATO decision was the readiness to `horse trade with the Soviet Union for the reduction or total elimination of these missiles against similar reductions or elimination of the Russian SS-20s .",
      "NATO carried out its plans to station cruise missiles in Europe despite strong protests from the peace movements and heavy diplomatic pressure in the European Parliament . NATOs condition for not carrying out its plans was the Soviet Unions willingness to halt the deployment of mobile SS-20 nuclear missiles aimed at Europe and remove the missiles already deployed . In 1979 , when the NATO decision was taken , the Soviet Union had 14 ( 1 operational ) SS-20 launch sites . The eighty Soviet SS-20s located in the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) and Czechoslovakia were aimed at targets in Western Europe . According to Western estimates , at the beginning of 1986 , the Soviet Union already deployed 279 SS-20 launching installations with a total of 837 nuclear warheads in the GDR and Czechoslovakia .",
      "The first General Dynamics BGM-109 Tomahawk Ground-Launched Cruise Missiles to arrive in Europe went to the 501st Tactical Missile Wing ( TMW ) at RAF Greenham Common , England . The controversial weapons were delivered by a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter on 14 November 1983 . By 1986 , there were 32 operational cruise missile launching installations in England ( RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth ) , Belgium ( Florennes Air Base ) , and on Sicily ( Comiso Air Base ) . Because each GLCM launching installation was composed of four weapons , the total number of cruise missiles stationed in Europe was 128 .",
      "Luckily , disarmament talks between East and West resulted in a disarmament treaty being signed by Soviet Communist Party Chairman Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan at the end of 1987 during Gorbachevs visit to the United States . The Soviet Union agreed to dismantle the SS-20s and with that the deployment of American cruise missiles in Europe was over once and for all .",
      "The historic Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , ratified in 1988 , mandated the first-ever elimination of an entire class of weapons from U.S . and Soviet inventories . USAFE completed removal of the ground-launched cruise missiles and other weaponry on 26 March 1991 , when the last 16 missiles were removed from Comiso Air Base , Italy .",
      "Post\u2013Cold War era .",
      "USAFE never had to fight the Soviet Armed Forces and the Warsaw Pact states in Europe . The Soviet Union collapsed in 1990\u201391 . The end of the Cold War saw a clamoring for a peace dividend , and questions from many U.S . and Western European officials about the appropriate size and purpose of American military forces in Europe .",
      "All U.S . and NATO allies military forces experienced a series of changes over the next five years . USAFE shrunk from over 850 aircraft and 72,000 personnel scattered among 27 bases in 1990 to approximately 240 aircraft , 33,000 personnel , and six flying bases by the end of 1996 . In July 1994 , with President Clinton in attendance , the British , French , and American air and land forces in Berlin were inactivated in a ceremony on the Four Ring Parade field at Tempelhof Central Airport .",
      "Iraq and Kuwait in the 1990s .",
      "With the onset of Operations Desert Shield in August 1990 and Desert Storm in January 1991 , more than 180 aircraft and 5,400 personnel assigned to USAFE units deployed to the Persian Gulf area . In conjunction , more than 100 additional aircraft and 2,600 personnel deployed to Turkey for Joint Task Force Proven Force , forming the 7440th Composite Wing ( Provisional ) . A total of 60,000 USAFE personnel were committed to the war effort ; however , fewer than 10,000 actually deployed . More than half of the commands aircraft deployed to support Desert Storm .",
      "The commands air support was lethal . For example , USAFE accounted for only 20 percent of the air-to-air assets in Desert Storm , but claimed half of the air-to-air kills . More than 85,000 tons of munitions , including more than 35,000 bombs and 7,800 missiles , were built up in theatre . These were used in countless strike , interdiction and close air support missions .",
      "USAFE activated aeromedical staging facilities and contingency hospitals , increasing available bed space 1,500 percent above normal peacetime operations . More than 9,000 patients , mostly suffering from noncombat-related illnesses and injuries , were evacuated to Europe . More than 3,000 were treated at USAFE medical facilities . Almost 7,600 patients were later air evacuated to the Continental United States for follow-on treatment .",
      "After Desert Storm ended , Kurdish rebels and Iraqi forces continued fighting in northern Iraq . The Kurds began a mass exodus toward Turkey and later Iran . A multi-national effort , including U.S . forces , was slowly established to save lives during Operation Provide Comfort ( OPC ) and this was mainly done by establishing the Iraqi no-fly zones starting above the 36th parallel in Iraq . The operation immediately began air dropping food and supplies to the refugees . More than 2,400 USAFE personnel were deployed , along with 36 fighter aircraft to provide protection for the transports . In a relatively new role , USAFE used A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft to spot and mark the pockets of Kurds needing humanitarian relief . As Operation Provide Comfort drew to a close , Kurdish leaders asked for continued protection from the Iraqi Army . Operation Provide Comfort II ( OPC II ) picked up where the first operation left off , building a multinational rapidly deployable air and ground forces in Turkey ready to defend the Kurds .",
      "Operation Northern Watch ( ONW ) commenced on 1 January 1997 as the successor to Operation Provide Comfort . It was run by a Combined Task Force ( CTF ) charged with enforcing a no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in Iraq , with the United States , United Kingdom , and Turkey providing approximately 45 aircraft and more than 1,400 personnel . In addition to USAF airmen , the joint U.S . forces of some 1,100 U.S . personnel , included sailors , soldiers , and Marines , as well as sorties from every air arm of the U.S . armed forces . The USAF portion of ONW was primarily a USAFE operation , since all USAF assets participating operated out of Europe . The USAF portion of the mission was partially flown by rotational aircraft and units from Air Combat Command , Air Mobility Command , Pacific Air Forces , Air Force Special Operations Command , and Air Force Reserve Command , and Air National Guard units operationally-gained by them .",
      "The original mandate from the Turkish government allowed the operation to continue for six months . Turkey subsequently approved two 6-month extensions , but indicated that it would not become a permanent mission . For the first year of the mission , northern Iraq was quiet , with no combat between Coalition aircraft and Iraqi forces .",
      "From December 1998 to March 1999 , U.S . and coalition aircraft over northern Iraq came under almost daily fire from Iraqi surface-to-air missile sites and anti-aircraft guns . These aircraft responded by bombing Iraqi air-defense sites which fired on them , utilizing laser-guided bombs as well as AGM-88 HARM missiles and AGM-130 long range air-to-surface missiles . Coalition aircraft flew patrols on an average of 18 days per month , and were usually fired upon . The most common threat was from anti-aircraft guns . Despite Saddam Hussein offering a $14,000 reward for downing a Coalition aircraft , no warplanes were ever shot down . During the first months of 1999 , Coalition activity over northern Iraq was temporarily halted as aircraft were moved to Italy to take part in Operation Allied Force .",
      "Low level conflict over Northern Iraq continued up until the 2003 invasion of Iraq , although the number of incidents declined dramatically after 1999 . The final ONW combat air patrol occurred on 17 March 2003 from Incirlik Air Base . Six weeks later , the operation concluded with an official stand down on 1 May 2003 . A grand total of 36,000 sorties were flown during Operation Northern Watch , and 40,000 personnel had been deployed at some point during the operation . USAFE also sent aircraft and personnel to help man Operation Southern Watch , operating from Saudi Arabia under Central Command Air Forces .",
      "Balkans operations .",
      "USAFE also provided air protection over the skies of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Operation Deny Flight . Along with allies from NATO countries , U.S . aircrews bombed targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina during Operation Deliberate Force , which paved the way for the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement . USAFE then helped deploy the Implementation Force ( I-FOR ) and its equipment to Bosnia for Operation Joint Endeavor and sustained them by airlift .",
      "USAFE forces again mobilized in March 1999 , when NATO intervened in Kosovo to halt a Yugoslav counter-insurgency targeting the Kosovo Liberation Army . USAFE forces provided air-support for Albanian fighters on the ground . Albanian refugees appeared after the beginning of hostilities . Efforts to find a diplomatic solution collapsed , resulting in Operation Allied Force\u2013the NATO-led air war over Kosovo . The 78-day operation ended 20 June culminating in the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and the eventual return of refugees . USAFEs 3rd Air Force led Joint Task Force Shining Hope , established to assist the hundreds of thousands of refugees who left Kosovo because of war . USAFE continues to contribute to NATO-led forces promoting peace and stability in Kosovo .",
      "Afghanistan and Iraq .",
      "During the War in Afghanistan , USAFE has supported an air bridge from Europe to Asia that delivered 3,300 tons of humanitarian daily rations to northern Afghanistan , opened the Manus base in Kyrgyzstan , and established a medical evacuation network that moved nearly 4,000 patients . USAFE deployed 24 fighter aircraft , eight KC-135 Stratotankers and nearly 2,400 people in Operation Iraqi Freedom . It opened an important airfield in northern Iraq and provided critical en route support to deploying forces , not to mention vital logistical and medical support to forward-deployed forces . USAFE subsequently supported and Operation Inherent Resolve .",
      "Today , USAFE airmen are engaged in a wide range of active U.S . military efforts in Europe and Africa , including realistic U.S . and NATO exercises and operations in Afghanistan , Iraq , and Somalia .",
      "On 20 April 2012 , USAFAF was merged with USAFE to become United States Air Forces in Europe \u2013 Air Forces Africa ( USAFE-AFAFRICA ) .",
      "The merger was a result of Seventeenth Air Force at Ramstein Air Base inactivating in April 2012 as part of an Air Force cost savings effort . USAFE assumed the former staff functions of 17th Air Force , while the 3d Air Force and its 603rd Air and Space Operations Center assumed responsibility for U.S . military air operations in Africa ( except for Egypt ) , with the 603 AOC absorbing the former 617th Air Operations Center .",
      "Operating units in 2015 .",
      "Third Air Force ( 3 AF ) , headquartered at Ramstein Air Base , Germany , is USAFEs sole numbered air force , operating alongside Headquarters USAFE . Its mission is ensuring the combat readiness of assigned USAFE units , formulation of plans for combat operations and non-combat humanitarian operations in the USAFE and AFAFRICA areas of responsibility , and conducting day-to-day operations for both European and Africa Commands .",

In addition to its own units , the command is routinely augmented by rotational aircraft and personnel from Air Combat Command ( ACC ) , Air Mobility Command ( AMC ) , Air Force Special Operations Command ( AFSOC ) and Air Force Global Strike Command ( AFGSC ) units in the United States , as well as Air Force Reserve Command ( AFRC ) and Air National Guard ( ANG ) units .",
      "Air Forces Africa comprises at least three air expeditionary groups . The 449th Air Expeditionary Group at Camp Lemonnier , Djibouti flies a multitude of missions for Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Horn of Africa ( CJTF-HOA ) . It consists of the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron ( C-130 ) , HC-130Ps from the 81st Expeditionary Rescue Squadron , and pararescuemen from the 82nd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron . Aircraft and personnel for the 81 ERQS and 82 ERQS are rotated from rescue wings in the United States .",
      "The 60th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron flew UAVs from Djibouti from after 2010 until it was inactivated in 2015 .",
      "404 AEG is located at Ramstein AB , Germany . It was most recently reactivated in October 2008 . Since that activation , the 404 AEG has been heavily involved in contingency operations on the African continent . The 404 AEG sent aircraft to Rwanda in January 2009 to move Rwandan Army equipment destined for the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur , and in July 2009 deployed to Ghana to provide aerial port and aircraft maintenance teams , along with forward communications , early warning and air domain safety and security elements ahead of a visit by President Barack Obama .",
      "The 409th Air Expeditionary Group ( 409 AEG ) carries out surveillance and reconnaissance missions across the entire Africa Command area of responsibility , from multiple locations . It is equipped with unmanned aerial vehicles . Previously , probably during the initial phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom , it operated from Bourgas , Bulgaria .",

Following one unsuccessful attempt , she was elected to Parliament in as the member for Mount Albert , an electorate she represented until 2009 .",
      "Clark held numerous Cabinet positions in the Fourth Labour Government , including Minister of Housing , Minister of Health and Minister of Conservation . She was Deputy Prime Minister from 1989 to 1990 under Prime Ministers Geoffrey Palmer and Mike Moore . After Labours narrow defeat in the , Clark challenged Moore for leadership of the party and won , becoming the Leader of the Opposition . Following the , Labour formed a governing coalition , and Clark was sworn in as Prime Minister on 10 December 1999 .",
      "Clark led the Fifth Labour Government , which implemented several major economic initiatives including Kiwibank , the New Zealand Superannuation Fund , the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme and KiwiSaver . Her government also introduced the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 , which caused major controversy . In foreign affairs , Clark sent troops to the Afghanistan War , but did not contribute combat troops to the Iraq War , and ordered a deployment to the 2006 East Timorese crisis . She advocated a number of free-trade agreements with major trading partners , including becoming the first developed nation to sign such an agreement with China . After three successive electoral victories , her government was defeated in the ; Clark resigned as Prime Minister and party leader on 19 November 2008 . She was succeeded as Prime Minister by John Key of the National Party , and as Leader of the Labour Party by Phil Goff .",
      "Clark resigned from Parliament in April 2009 shortly after losing the 2008 general election , to become the first female head of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) .

Her thesis focused on rural political behaviour and representation . As a teenager Clark became politically active , protesting against the Vietnam War and campaigning against foreign military bases in New Zealand .",
      "Clark has worked actively in the New Zealand Labour Party for most of her life . In 1971 she assisted Labour candidates to the Auckland City Council , three of whom were elected . Following this , she stood for the Auckland City Council herself in 1974 and 1977 . While generally polling well , she never won a seat , missing out by only 105 votes in the latter .",
      "Clark was a junior lecturer in political studies at the University of Auckland from 1973 to 1975 . In 1974 she sought the nomination for the Auckland Central electorate , but lost to Richard Prebble . She instead stood for , a National safe seat . Clark studied abroad on a University Grants Committee post-graduate scholarship in 1976 , and then lectured in political studies at Auckland again while undertaking her PhD ( which she never completed ) from 1977 until her election to Parliament in 1981 . Her father supported National that election .",
      "Clark served as a member of Labours national executive committee from 1978 until September 1988 , and again from April 1989 .

Clark held the positions of president of the Labour Youth Council , executive member of the partys Auckland Regional Council , secretary of the Labour Womens Council and member of the Policy Council .",
      "She represented the New Zealand Labour Party at the congresses of the Socialist International and of the Socialist International Women in 1976 , 1978 , 1983 and 1986 , at an Asia-Pacific Socialist Organisation Conference held in Sydney in 1981 , and at the Socialist International Party Leaders Meeting in Sydney in 1991 .",
      "Member of Parliament .",
      "Clark did not contest the , but in 1980 she put her name forward to replace long serving MP Warren Freer in the safe Labour seat of Mount Albert . She beat six other contenders including electorate chairman Keith Elliot , former MP Malcolm Douglas and future MP Jack Elder for the nomination .",
      "Clark was duly elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives in the 1981 general election , as one of eight female members in the 40th Parliament . In winning the Mount Albert electorate in Auckland , she became the second woman elected to represent an Auckland electorate , and the seventeenth woman elected to the New Zealand Parliament . Her first parliamentary intervention , on taking her seat was on 12 April 1982 to give notice , she would move a motion condemning the US Navys deployment of nuclear cruise missiles in the Pacific Two weeks later in her maiden speech , with unusual emphasis on defence policy and the arms race , Clark again condemned the deployment of cruise , Pershing and SS20 and the global ambitions of both superpowers navies , but claimed the Soviet admirals did not plough New Zealands waters and expressed particular concern about the expansion of the 1965 memo of ANZUS understanding for the resupply of weapons to New Zealand to include nuclear weapon resupply .",
      "During her first term in the House ( 1981\u20131984 ) , Clark became a member of the Statutes Revision Committee . In her second term ( 1984\u20131987 ) , she chaired the Select committee on Foreign Affairs and the Select Committee on Disarmament and Arms Control , both of which combined with the Defence Select Committee in 1985 to form a single committee . In 1983 she was appointed as Labours spokesperson for Overseas Aid and Disarmament .",
      "Cabinet Minister .",
      "In 1987 , Clark became a Cabinet minister in the Fourth Labour Government , led by David Lange ( 1984\u20131989 ) , Geoffrey Palmer ( 1989\u20131990 ) and Mike Moore ( 1990 ) . She served as Minister of Conservation from August 1987 until January 1989 and as Minister of Housing from August 1987 until August 1989 . She became Minister of Health in January 1989 , and took on additional portfolios as Minister of Labour and Deputy Prime Minister in August 1989 . As Health Minister , Clark introduced a series of legislative changes that allowed midwives to practice autonomously . She also introduced the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 , a law which restricted smoking in places such as workplaces and schools .",
      "As Deputy Prime Minister , Clark chaired the Cabinet Social Equity Committee , and was a member of several other important Cabinet committees , such as the Policy Committee , Economic Development and Employment Committee , and Domestic and External Security Committee .",
      "Leader of the Opposition .",
      "From October 1990 until December 1993 Clark held the posts of Deputy Leader of the Opposition , Shadow spokesperson for Health and Labour , and member of the Social Services Select Committee and of the Labour Select Committee . After the National Party won the 1993 general election with a majority of one seat , Clark successfully challenged Mike Moore for the leadership of the parliamentary party . She was particularly critical of Moore for delivering blurred messages during the 1993 election campaign , and accused him of failing to re-brand Labour as a centre-left party which had jettisoned Rogernomics .",
      "Clark became the Leader of the Opposition on 1 December 1993 . She led the Labour Party in opposition to the National-led government of Jim Bolger ( 1990\u20131997 ) and Jenny Shipley ( 1997\u20131999 ) . Clark announced her first shadow cabinet on 13 December 1993 , but the ousted Moore refused any portfolios . There were frequent changes after several party defections took place during the parliamentary term in the lead up to the new MMP voting system . At one reshuffle , in June 1995 , Clark herself took the shadow foreign affairs portfolio .",
      "The Labour Party rated poorly in opinion polls in the run-up to the 1996 general election , and Clark suffered from a low personal approval rating . At one point polls suggested that New Zealand First of Winston Peters would even poll 30% and Labour would be beaten into third place . However , she survived an attempted leadership coup by senior members who favoured Phil Goff . Labour lost the election in October 1996 , but Clark remained as Opposition leader . Clark was seen as having convincingly won the election debates which led to Labour doing better than predicted . Shortly before the election she also achieved a rapprochement with Moore ( who was previously thinking of setting up his own party ) who accepted the foreign affairs and overseas trade portfolios , calming internal tensions .",
      "During the 1998 Waitangi Day celebrations , Clark was prevented from speaking on the marae by activist Titewhai Harawira in protest over Clarks being allowed to speak in direct contradiction of traditional M\u0101ori protocol . The ensuing argument saw Clark being reduced to tears on national television .",
      "In 1999 , Clark was involved in a defamation case in the High Court of New Zealand with Auckland orthopaedic surgeon Joe Brownlee , resulting in Clarks making an unreserved apology . The case centered on a press statement issued by Clark criticising Brownlee , triggered by a constituents complaint over the outcome of a hip replacement . Clark admitted the criticism was unjustified in that the complication suffered by her constituent was rare , unforeseen and unavoidable .",
      "Prime Minister ( 1999\u20132008 ) .",
      "Under Clarks leadership , Labour became the largest party in parliament from 1999 to 2008 . Clark became the second woman to serve as Prime Minister of New Zealand , and the first to have won office at an election . She also served as the Minister for Arts , Culture and Heritage throughout her premiership . She had additional ministerial responsibility for the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service ( NZSIS ) and for Ministerial Services . During her period in office , women held a number of prominent elected and appointed offices in New Zealand , such as the Governor-General , Speaker of the House of Representatives and Chief Justice\u2014these major offices of state were simultaneously occupied by women between March 2005 and August 2006 . As a female head of government , Clark was a member of the Council of Women World Leaders .",
      "Clark entered office just three years after the adoption of the Mixed Member Proportional ( MMP ) voting system , which had produced an unstable National-led government under Bolger and Shipley . Clark negotiated the formation of successive coalition governments . Political scientist Bryce Edwards identified Clarks ability to lead stable governments as her most significant achievement , arguing that her ability to work with a variety of coalition partners\u2014including the Alliance , Jim Andertons Progressive Party , Green , United Future and New Zealand First\u2014consolidated public support for MMP .",
      "Clarks particular interests included social policy and international affairs . A strong supporter of nuclear disarmament , Clark pursued a policy of peace-making within the Pacific region . She set herself the task of making New Zealand the first ecologically sustainable nation , describing this as central to New Zealands unique national identity . Her governments major policy achievements include the Working for Families package , increasing the minimum wage 5% a year , interest-free student loans , creation of District Health Boards , the introduction of a number of tax credits , overhauling the secondary school qualifications by introducing NCEA , and the introduction of fourteen weeks\u2019 parental leave . Commentators praised Clark ( along with Michael Cullen , the Minister of Finance ) for overseeing a period of sustained and stable economic growth , with an increase in employment that saw a gradual lowering of the unemployment rate to a record low of 3.6% ( in 2005 ) .",
      "Clark made every attempt to make sure that gender was not an issue in politics . However , Bryce Edwards states that others did . Clark was portrayed as bloodsucking , cold , and humourless . Clark says herself that when her male counterparts spoke in the media , they looked strong and determined , whereas when she portrayed the same characteristics , the media made it to look like she was tough and nagging .",
      "In 2006 Clark was 20th in Forbes magazines ranking of the worlds 100 most powerful women . By the time she left office in 2008 this had fallen to 56th .",
      "First term : 1999\u20132002 .",
      "The 1999 general election produced a historic moment for New Zealand ; for the first time , two women , Clark and Shipley , campaigned against each other as leaders of the countrys two major parties . Clark repeatedly stated her desire to govern alone rather than as part of a coalition . However , in the lead up to the election , Labour made overtures to the left-wing Alliance . Clark addressed the Alliances annual conference in August 1998 . On polling day Labour returned 49 seats , an increase of 12 , ahead of Nationals 39 seats . The first Clark-led Cabinet linked Labour with the Alliance . Alliance leader Jim Anderton served as Deputy Prime Minister under Clark until 2002 . The full ministerial team , and portfolios , was announced on 9 December\u201412 days after the election\u2014and the new government was sworn in the following day . The coalition partners pioneered agree to disagree procedures to manage policy differences . Such procedures lessened the chances of Cabinet becoming publicly divided and running the risk of losing the confidence of the House of Representatives .",
      "In January 2000 , the then Police Commissioner , Peter Doone , resigned after The Sunday Star-Times alleged he had prevented the breath testing of his partner Robyn , who had driven the car they occupied , by telling the officer that wont be necessary . Both Doone and the officer involved denied this happened . Doone sued the Sunday Star-Times for defamation in 2005 , but the paper revealed they had checked the story with Clark . She confirmed this , but denied that she had made attempts to get Doone to resign and defended being the source as by definition I cannot leak . Clark also responded by saying that National supporters had funded Doones defamation-suit . Opinion on the significance of this incident varied .",
      "In 2000 , Labour MP Chris Carter investigated the background of one of Clarks Cabinet colleagues , M\u0101ori Affairs Minister Dover Samuels , regarding allegations of historic statutory rape . Ex-convict John Yelash claimed that Carter had approached him to help with the investigation ; a claim that Carter denied . Clark backed her MP , referring to Yelash as a murderer when he had in fact been convicted of manslaughter , a less serious offence . Yelash sued Clark for defamation , resulting in an out-of-court settlement .",
      "In April 2001 , Clark met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin during an official visit to Beijing . Jiang referred to the Prime Minister as an old friend . He stated that China hoped to establish bilateral long-term and stable overall cooperative relations [ with New Zealand ] . Clark strongly supported Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization .",
      "In March 2002 , Clark made her first visit to the United States as Prime Minister . She visited Ground Zero , the former site of the World Trade Center , where the New York City Police Department presented her with a New Zealand flag that had been recovered from the rubble after the September 11 attacks . On 26 March , Clark visited the Pentagon and Washington , D.C. , where she met with American officials , including a private meeting with President George W . Bush . Most of the agenda for Clarks visit focused on the joint counter-terrorism campaign ( dubbed the War on Terror ) .",
      "As Opposition Leader in 1998 , Clark signed her name to a canvas that had been painted on by another artist . The painting was subsequently auctioned to charity . After the act came to light in April 2002 , the opposition National Party referred the matter to the Police . A police report found evidence for a prima facie case of forgery , but determined that it was not in the public interest to prosecute Clark .",
      "In June 2002 , Clark apologised on behalf of New Zealand for aspects of the countrys treatment of Samoa during the colonial era . Clarks apology was made in Apia during the 40th anniversary of Samoas independence and televised live to New Zealand where Samoans applauded the Prime Ministers gesture .",
      "The Alliance split in 2002 over the Governments commitment of New Zealand troops to the War in Afghanistan , leading to the imminent dissolution of Labours coalition with that party . Consequently , Clark called for an early election to be held on 27 July . Political opponents claimed that Clark could have continued to govern , and that a snap election was called to take advantage of Labours strong position in opinion polls . In opinion surveys conducted during the election campaign , Clark scored high approval ratings and was far ahead of other party leaders as preferred Prime Minister .",
      "A major issue during the 2002 election campaign was the end of a moratorium on genetic engineering , strongly opposed by the rival Green Party . The debate was reignited when investigative journalist Nicky Hager published a book , Seeds of Distrust , in which he alleged that Clarks government had covered up a contamination of genetically modified corn plants in 2000 . A television interview with John Campbell was terminated by Clark when she was taken by surprise from the allegations , which she claimed to have known nothing about prior to the interview . The affair was dubbed Corngate by the media .",
      "Second term : 2002\u20132005 .",
      "Clark won a second term in the 2002 general election\u2014her party increased both its share of the vote and number of seats . Labour subsequently entered into a coalition with Jim Andertons Progressive Party ( a spin-off of the Alliance ) , with parliamentary confidence and supply coming from United Future , and a good-faith agreement with the Green Party . Michael Cullen , who served as Minister of Finance , was appointed Deputy Prime Minister by Clark , replacing Anderton .",
      "A republican , Clark stated in 2002 that she thought it was inevitable that New Zealand would become a republic in the near future . Her term in office saw a number of alleged moves in this direction , under her governments policy of building national identity . Examples include the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council in London and the foundation of the Supreme Court of New Zealand , the abolition of titular Knighthood and Damehood honours ( restored in 2009 ) , and the abolition of the title Queens Counsel ( replaced by Senior Counsel , restored in 2012 ) .",
      "In 2003 , Clark criticised the Invasion of Iraq without an explicit United Nations mandate , and her government opposed New Zealand military action in the Iraq War . Her government did not send combat troops to Iraq , although some medical and engineering units were sent . Clarks foreign policy reflected the priorities of liberal internationalism , especially the promotion of democracy and human rights ; the strengthening of the role of the United Nations ; the advancement of antimilitarism and disarmament ; and the encouragement of free-trade . In March 2003 , referring to the US-led coalitions actions in Iraq , Clark told the newspaper The Sunday Star-Times that , I dont think that 11 September under a Gore presidency would have had this consequence for Iraq . She later sent a letter to Washington apologising for any offence that her comment may have caused .",
      "On 17 July 2004 , a motorcade involving police , Diplomatic Protection Squad , and Ministerial Services staff reached speeds of up to 172 km/h when taking Clark and Cabinet Minister Jim Sutton from Waimate to Christchurch Airport so she could attend a rugby union match in Wellington . The courts subsequently convicted the drivers involved for driving offences , but appeals resulted in the quashing of these convictions in December 2005 and August 2006 .",
      "Clark said that she was busy working in the back seat and had no influence or role in the decision to speed and did not realise the speed of her vehicle .",
      "In November 2004 , Clark announced that negotiations with China had commenced for a free-trade agreement , eventually signing a comprehensive agreement in July 2008 . It was New Zealands largest trade deal since the 1983 Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia .",
      "Third term : 2005\u20132008 .",
      "In 2005 , following that years general election , Labour and the Progressive Party renewed their coalition , with confidence and supply arrangements with both New Zealand First and United Future in exchange for giving the leaders of those parties ministerial positions outside Cabinet . Clark became first Labour leader to win three consecutive elections . Clark won 66% of her electorates votes , or 20,918 votes with a 14,749 majority .",
      "On Armistice Day , 11 November 2006 , Clark attended a service in Hyde Park , London , where a monument commemorating New Zealands war dead was unveiled . During her visit she met Queen Elizabeth , Prince Charles and British Prime Minister Tony Blair .",
      "On 26 May 2006 , Clark ordered a military deployment to the 2006 East Timorese crisis alongside international partners .",
      "Clarks major overseas visit of her third term was a trip to the United States in March 2007 , where she met with George W . Bush in Washington . Despite her strained relationship with the President , they agreed on many issues , including working cooperatively in foreign affairs , commerce and the need for both nations to work toward energy security .",
      "On 8 February 2008 , Clark was recognised as the longest-serving leader of the Labour Party in its history ( although some uncertainty exists over the exact date when Harry Holland became party leader ) , having served for 14 years , 69 days . By 26 October 2008 she had passed Hollands longest possible term and her position as longest-serving Labour leader was put beyond doubt .",
      "By the end of her tenure in office , Clark had come to be seen as a divisive figure , going from a Herald-DigiPoll popularity rating of nearly 60% in 2005 to 42% at the time of the 2008 general election . Portrayals of Clark as controlling and manipulative after the 2005 election increased when she abandoned her consensus-managerial approach , such as during the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy , and her support of the Crimes ( Substituted Section 59 ) Amendment Act 2007 ( the so-called anti-smacking law ) . She was accused of having a nanny state approach to social issues , a perception captured by the pejorative term Helengrad .",
      "Labour had been consistently behind the National Party in opinion polls since 2006 , and the gap widened significantly in early 2007 . On 5 August 2008 the Treasury announced that the New Zealand economy had entered a recession .",
      "Clarks personal popularity was eclipsed by John Key soon after the latters election as National Party Leader in November 2006 . In the final media polls prior to the Key was ahead of Clark in preferred prime minister polls by eight points in the Fairfax Media Nielsen poll and four points in the One News Colmar Brunton poll . In the 2008 election campaign , Clark attacked the National Party as insincere in its promise to maintain many of her governments flagship projects , such as KiwiSaver and Kiwibank .",
      "National overtook Labour as the largest party following the 2008 election . Labour did not have the numbers to ally with smaller parties and no viable path to government ; Clark conceded defeat to Key and announced that she was standing down as party leader . On 11 November 2008 Clark was succeeded by Phil Goff as Leader of the Labour Party . In the first Labour Party conference after its defeat Phil Goff acknowledged that Clarks government had become identified with nanny-state policies in the public mind , and said that the party wanted to draw a line under the past and say , yes , we made mistakes , we didnt listen .",
      "Reputation and legacy .",
      "Early in her career Clark gained a reputation as a capable advocate of nuclear disarmament and public health policy . As party leader , Clark denounced Rogernomics as a ghastly period and won the 1999 election by abandoning its legacy . However , biographer Denis Welch has argued that she did not do enough to repudiate the paradigm created by Rogernomics , instead allowing Labour and National to become increasingly hard to tell apart on many issues .",
      "Clarks government was pragmatic , managerial , concerned with stability , and focused on incremental changes over grand projects . Political scientist Bryce Edwards argues that Clark was never a conviction politician and set out to be a successful rather than great politician , leaving behind a legacy of incremental reforms of New Zealand and good management of the status quo , but no bold ambitions . Likewise , commentator John Armstrong , while praising Clark , describes her as a technocratic prime minister who will be remembered more for her management abilities than a capacity to inspire .",
      "In January 2009 , two months after losing office , Clark was voted Greatest Living New Zealander in an opt-in website poll run by The New Zealand Herald . In a close race she received 25 percent of the vote , ahead of Victoria Cross recipient Willie Apiata at 21 percent . Then Prime Minister John Key said he was not surprised by the poll , saying she is well thought of as a New Zealand Prime Minister .",
      "Forbes magazine ranked Clark the 22nd most powerful woman in the world in 2016 , down from 20th in 2006 .",
      "Post-premiership .",
      "Clark was the first defeated Labour Prime Minister to immediately resign the party leadership rather than lead it in Opposition . She served as the shadow foreign affairs spokesperson in the Shadow Cabinet of Phil Goff for several months before retiring from Parliament in April 2009 to accept a position with the United Nations ( UN ) .",
      "United Nations Development Programme .",
      "Clark became the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) on 17 April 2009 , and was the first woman to lead the organisation . She was also the Chair of the United Nations Development Group , a committee consisting of the heads of all UN funds , programmes and departments working on development issues . The New Zealand Government strongly supported her nomination , along with Australia , the Pacific Island nations and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Gordon Brown . She also received the support of the five countries on the bureau of the UNDP board ( Iran , Haiti , Serbia , The Netherlands and Tanzania ) and was unanimously confirmed by the General Assembly on 31 March . She was sworn in by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 27 April 2009 . In this position , Forbes deemed her the 23rd most powerful woman in the world .",
      "In 2013 , Forbes upgraded her position to 21st most powerful woman in the world after she was appointed to administer UNDP for a second term and for her potential future as UN Secretary General . She was the only New Zealander to make the list .",
      "Clark was recognised for her managerial style of leadership . During her tenure , she was an advocate of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative . She worked to reform the administration and bureaucracy of UNDP , with an emphasis on greater transparency in the organisation . The Publish What You Fund campaign ranked UNDP as the most transparent aid organisation in the world in 2015 and 2016 , under Clarks administration .",
      "In February 2015 , Clark visited Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone to express solidarity with those working to prevent the spread of Ebola .",
      "During her tenure , the ratio of women to men at UNDP reached 50% , including at the most senior level of the organisation .",
      "On 24 May 2016 , a Foreign Policy article alleged that Clarks tenure as Administrator had left a trail of embittered peers and subordinates , and accused her of undercutting the UNs promotion of human rights . The article centred on an allegation that her senior staff retaliated against a critical report of the UNDP by forcing out an official who had participated in the investigation . Both the UNDP and Clark have denied the claims .",
      "On 26 January 2017 , Clark announced that she would not seek re-election as UNDP Administrator after the completion of her four-year term . She said it had been an honour and privilege to have served in the role . She left UNDP on 19 April 2017 .",
      "United Nations Secretary-General selection .",
      "In January 2014 , a Guardian interview with Clark raised the possibility that she could take over as UN Secretary-General after Ban Ki-moons retirement in 2016 . She did not confirm her interest , but commented : There will be interest in whether the UN will have a first woman because theyre looking like the last bastions , as it were . She also said in the same interview that : If theres enough support for the style of leadership that I have , it will be interesting . In response , Prime Minister John Key said the New Zealand Government would support a bid , but cautioned that it would be a tough task to get the job .",
      "On 4 April 2016 , Helen Clark officially submitted her nomination as New Zealands candidate for the 2016 UN Secretary-General selection . In an interview on the same day , Clark stressed that she was running as the gender-neutral best candidate and not on the basis of being a woman .",
      "The UNs role in the Haiti cholera outbreak has been widely discussed and criticised . There has been indisputable evidence that the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti . Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal were carrying asymptomatic cholera and they did not treat their waste properly before dumping it into Haitis water stream . When asked about compensation for victims , Clark has declined to take a position , calling it legal issues .",
      "Another issue that received attention during Clarks candidacy was allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers . This gross problem was brought to light after Anders Kompass exposed the sexual assault of children by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic . During the United Nations Secretary General Candidate informal dialogues , Clark said that the UN needed to deal quickly with sexual exploitation and abuse , and gender-based violence by peacekeepers .",
      "Straw polls were taken by secret ballot in October 2016 . Clark finished fifth place in the sixth poll ; her candidacy was effectively vetoed when three of the permanent Security Council members voted against her .",
      "Clarks bid for Secretary-General is the topic of a documentary film , My Year With Helen , directed by Gaylene Preston , which premiered in February 2018 .",
      "World Health Organization .",
      "On 9 July 2020 the World Health Organization ( WHO ) appointed Clark as co-chair of a panel reviewing the WHOs handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response of governments to the outbreak . The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response ( IPPR ) examined how the outbreak occurred and how future pandemics can be prevented . She served in the role alongside former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , and of her appointment Clark said she hesitated before accepting because she felt the panels task was mission impossible . Clarks appointment to this panel drew criticism from UN Watchs Executive Director Hillel Neuer , who criticised her close ties with the pro-Beijing UN Goodwill Ambassador James Chau and her previous endorsement of Cuba for sending medical personnel abroad . On 11 November , Neuer called on Clark to resign , claiming that her alleged favouritism towards China and the WHO , would affect the investigation into Chinas handling of the COVID-19 pandemic . Clark responded that she had no ties with China .",
      "On 19 January , the independent panel concluded that Chinese officials could have moved faster in January 2020 to curb the initial COVID-19 outbreak , and criticised the WHO for not declaring an international emergency until 30 January 2020 . In the final report published in May 2021 , the panel concluded that the pandemic could have been prevented if countries had taken a more proactive approach in February 2020 ; Clark said so many countries chose to wait and see .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Clark was brought up as a Presbyterian Christian , attending Sunday school weekly . When she was Prime Minister she described herself as an agnostic .",
      "She married sociologist Peter Davis , her partner of five years in 1981 , shortly before she was elected to Parliament . Clark had been under pressure from some Labour members to marry for political purposes , despite her personal reservations about marriage . Davis is a professor in medical sociology and was director of COMPASS ( Centre of Methods and Policy Application in the Social Sciences ) at the University of Auckland .",
      "Clark , after the 1981 elections was to note : It was a difficult campaign , Clark wrote in an essay for the book Head and Shoulders in 1984 . As a single woman I was really hammered . I was accused of being a lesbian , of living in a commune , having friends who were Trotskyites and gays... .",
      "In March 2001 , Clark referred to National MP Wyatt Creech as a scumbag and a sleazeball for having raised the issue of a potential conflict of interest involving Davis , who was leading an academic research team studying government health reforms .",
      "Clark is a keen hiker and mountaineer . In August 2008 , an expedition group that included Clark and her husband became stranded on the Two Thumb Range , a spur of the Southern Alps , when their guide ( and Clarks friend ) , Gottlieb Braun-Elwert , collapsed and died from a suspected heart attack .",
      "Views and positions .",
      "Social media .",
      "During her tenure as UNDP administrator and afterwards , Clarks presence on social media and avid use of Twitter has attracted positive attention in news media . She has called for greater regulation of social media platforms , and supports the Christchurch Call .",
      "Cannabis reform .",
      "During the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum , Clark publicly supported the Yes vote campaign to decriminalise recreational cannabis , arguing that prohibition did not work . She also featured in the We Do campaign supporting the proposed Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill .",

      "Imre Nagy",
      "Imre Nagy ( ; 7 June 1896 \u2013 16 June 1958 ) was a Hungarian communist politician who served as Prime Minister and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian Peoples Republic from 1953 to 1955 . In 1956 Nagy became leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 against the Soviet-backed government , for which he was sentenced to death and executed two years later .",
      "Nagy was a committed communist from soon after the Russian Revolution , and through the 1920s he engaged in underground party activity in Hungary . Living in the Soviet Union from 1930 , he served the Soviet NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941 , denouncing over 200 colleagues , who were then purged and arrested and 15 of whom were executed . Nagy returned to Hungary shortly before the end of World War II , and served in various offices as the Hungarian Working Peoples Party ( MDP ) took control of Hungary in the late 1940s and the country entered the Soviet sphere of influence . He played a key role in the ethnic cleansing ( deportation , in this case ) of hundreds of thousands of German-speaking Hungarians from 1945 to 1946 as Interior Minister of Hungary . Nagy became prime minister in 1953 and attempted to relax some of the harshest aspects of M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosis Stalinist regime , but was subverted and eventually forced out of the government in 1955 by R\u00e1kosis continuing influence as General Secretary of the MDP . Nagy remained popular with writers , intellectuals , and the common people , who saw him as an icon of reform against the hard-line elements in the Soviet-backed regime .",
      "The outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution on 23 October 1956 saw Nagy elevated to the position of Prime Minister on 24 October as a central demand of the revolutionaries and common people . Nagys reformist faction gained full control of the government , admitted non-communist politicians , dissolved the \u00c1VH secret police , promised democratic reforms , and unilaterally withdrew Hungary from the Warsaw Pact on 1 November . The Soviet Union launched a massive military invasion of Hungary on 4 November , forcibly deposing Nagy , who fled to the Embassy of Yugoslavia in Budapest . Nagy was lured out of the Embassy under false promises on 22 November , but was arrested and deported to Romania . On 16 June 1958 , Nagy was tried and executed for treason alongside his closest allies , and his body was buried in an unmarked grave .",
      "In June 1989 , Nagy and other prominent figures of the 1956 Revolution were rehabilitated and reburied with full honours , an event that played a key role in the collapse of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party regime .",
      "Early life and World War I .",
      "Imre Nagy was born prematurely on 7 June 1896 in the town of Kaposv\u00e1r in the Kingdom of Hungary , Austria-Hungary , to a small-town family of peasant origin . His father , J\u00f3zsef Nagy ( 1869\u20131929 ) , was a Lutheran and a carriage driver for the lieutenant-general of Somogy county . His mother , Roz\u00e1lia Szab\u00f3 ( 1877\u20131969 ) , served as a maid for the lieutenant-generals wife . They both had left the countryside in their youth to work in Kaposv\u00e1r . Nagy and Szab\u00f3 married in January 1896 . In 1902 , J\u00f3zsef became a postal worker and began building a house for the family in 1907 but lost his job in 1911 and had to sell the house . He was an unskilled worker for the rest of his life .",
      "In 1904 Nagys family moved to P\u00e9cs before returning to Kaposv\u00e1r the following year . Nagy attended a gymnasium in Kaposv\u00e1r from 1907 to 1912 , performing poorly . The gymnasium cancelled his tuition due to his lack of accomplishment and funding . He apprenticed as a locksmith in a small metalworking firm in Kaposv\u00e1r , before moving to a factory for agricultural machinery in Losonc in northern Hungary in 1912 . He returned to Kaposv\u00e1r in 1913 and was given a journeymans certificate as a metal fitter in 1914 . He abandoned the job in the summer of 1914 and became a clerk at a lawyers office , while simultaneously attending a commercial high school in Kaposv\u00e1r , where his student performance was good .",
      "After the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 , Nagy was called up for military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army in December 1914 and found fit for service . He reported for duty at the 17th Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d Infantry Regiment in May 1915 , after the end of the school year and before he had graduated . After three months of basic training in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r , his unit was sent to the Italian Front in August 1915 , where he was wounded in his leg at the Third Battle of the Isonzo . After convalescing in a field hospital , he was trained as a machine gunner in the 19th Machine Gun Battalion , promoted to corporal and sent to the Eastern Front in the summer of 1916 .",
      "Nagy was wounded in the leg by shrapnel and taken prisoner by the Imperial Russian Army during the Brusilov Offensive in Galicia on 29 July 1916 . After healing his leg wound in a field hospital , he was taken first to Darnitsa , then to Ryazan and finally on a train transport to Siberia .",
      "Early political career .",
      "In captivity in Camp Berezovka near Lake Baikal in Siberia he participated in a Marxist discussion group until 1917 . In 1918 , he joined the Communist ( Social Democratic ) Party of the Foreign Workers of Siberia , a sub-group of the Russian Communist Party . He fought in the ranks of the Red Army from February to September 1918 during the Russian Civil War . His unit was encircled and he was taken prisoner by the Czechoslovak Legion in early September 1918 . He escaped captivity and spent the period until February 1920 holding odd jobs in White-controlled territory near Lake Baikal . The Red Army reached Irkutsk on 7 February 1920 , ending Nagys participation in the Civil War . On 12 February 1920 he became a candidate member of the Russian Communist Party and a full-time member on 10 May . He served the rest of 1920 as a clerk for the communist Cheka secret police on matters related to prisoners of war .",
      "After a month of training by the Cheka in subversive activities , the Hungarian Communist Party ( KMP ) sent Nagy along with 277 other Hungarian communists to Hungary in April 1921 to build up an underground conspiratorial network in a country where the Communist Party had been banned since 1919 . Nagy reached Kaposv\u00e1r in late May 1921 . Upon arrival , he joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary ( MSZDP ) . After working temporary jobs in the rest of 1921 and early 1922 , he joined the First Hungarian Insurance Company and became an office worker in Kaposv\u00e1r . He became severely overweight around this time . He helped to build up the socialist movement in his hometown , to his parents disapproval . He became secretary of the MSZDPs local branch in 1924 . He was expelled from the party for advocating revolution and was placed under police surveillance . He married M\u00e1ria \u00c9get\u0151 on 28 November 1925 .",
      "In January 1926 , Nagy and Istv\u00e1n Sinkovics established the Kaposv\u00e1r office of the Socialist Workers\u2019 Party of Hungary ( MSZMP ) , a semi-communist left-wing splinter group from the MSZDP . Nagy was successful in gaining 700 voters for the MSZMP Kaposv\u00e1r parliamentary candidate , one of the partys few successes in the countryside west of Budapest . By this time Nagy had begun to prioritize his interest in agriculture over political leadership and rejected an offer from communist cadres from Vienna to build up the illegal KMP in western Hungary . The MSZMP in Kaposv\u00e1r was prohibited and Nagy was fired from his insurance job in February 1927 and arrested on 27 February . He was released after two months in prison . While under police surveillance , Nagy found a job as an agent for the Phoenix Insurance Company . He was arrested again in December 1927 for three days and was called to Vienna by the KMP , arriving in March 1928 . He became head of the KMPs agrarian section and was sent back to Hungary in September 1928 under a false identity to build up underground communist networks . His efforts were largely a failure , his largest successes being the publishing of three issues of a small journal and his avoidance of arrest . His advocacy of legal political activity over the partys preference for largely impotent clandestine work in villages was dismissed as right-deviancy by the ultra-left KMP leadership .",
      "Years in Moscow .",
      "In December 1929 , he traveled to the Soviet Union , arriving in Moscow in February 1930 to participate in the KMPs second congress . He rejoined the Communist Party , also becoming a Soviet citizen . He was engaged in agricultural research at the International Agrarian Institute for six years , but also worked in the Hungarian section of the Comintern . He was expelled from the party on 8 January 1936 and worked for the Soviet Statistical Service from the summer of 1936 onward . Under the codename Volodia , Nagy served the NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941 , giving up the names of over 200 comrades , mostly from the Agrarian Institute , who were then arrested and in at least 15 cases executed by the secret police . The NKVD praised him as a qualified agent , who shows great initiative and an ability to approach people . The support that Nagy received from the Soviet leadership after the Second World War was to some extent a result of his loyal service as a foreigner and denouncer to the NKVD .",
      "Minister in Communist Hungary .",
      "After the Second World War , Nagy returned to Hungary . He was the Minister of Agriculture in the government of B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s de D\u00e1lnok , delegated by the Hungarian Communist Party . He distributed land among the peasant population . In the next government , led by Tildy , he was the Minister of Interior . At this period he played an active role in the expulsion of the Hungarian Germans .",
      "In the communist government , he served as Minister of Agriculture and in other posts . He was also Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary from 1947 to 1949 , a largely ceremonial position . In 1951 , he signed , with the rest of the Politburo , the note ordering J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1rs arrest , resulting in K\u00e1d\u00e1rs torture and sentencing to life in prison after a show trial .",
      "After two years as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian Peoples Republic ( 1953\u20131955 ) , during which he promoted his New Course in Socialism , Nagy fell out of favour with the Soviet Politburo . He was deprived of his Hungarian Central Committee , Politburo , and all other Party functions and , on 18 April 1955 , he was sacked as Chairman of the Council of Ministers .",
      "1956 Revolution .",
      "Following Nikita Khrushchevs Secret Speech denouncing the crimes of Stalin on 25 February 1956 , dissent began to grow in Eastern Bloc against the ruling Stalinist-era party leaders . In Hungary , M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi\u2014who self-styled as Stalins greatest disciple\u2014came under increasingly intense criticism for his policies from both the Party and general populace , with more and more prominent voices calling for his resignation . This public criticism often took the form of the Pet\u0151fi Circle\u2014a debating club established by the DISZ student youth union to discuss Communist policy\u2014which soon became one of the foremost outlets of dissent against the regime . While Nagy himself never attended a Pet\u0151fi Circle meeting , he was kept well informed of events by his close associates Mikl\u00f3s V\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi and G\u00e9za Losonczy , who informed him of the vast popular support expressed for him at the meetings and the widespread desire for his restoration to the leadership .",
      "In the face of widespread public pressure on R\u00e1kosi , the Soviets forced the unpopular leader to resign from power on 18 July 1956 and leave for the Soviet Union . However , they replaced him with his equally hard-line second in command Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151 , a change which did little to mollify public dissent . Nagy was a prominent guest at the 6 October reburial of former secret police chief L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk , who had been purged by the R\u00e1kosi regime and later rehabilitated . He was readmitted to the Party on 13 October in the midst of growing revolutionary fervor . On 22 October , students from the Technical University in Budapest compiled a list of sixteen national policy demands , the third of which was Nagys restoration to the premiership .",
      "In the afternoon of 23 October , students and workers gathered in Budapest for a massive opposition demonstration arranged by the Technical University students , chanting\u2014among other things\u2014slogans of support for Imre Nagy . While the ex-premier sympathized with their reformist demands , he was hesitant to support the movement , believing it to be too radical in its demands . While he was in favor of changes to the system , he preferred those to be made within the framework of his New Course of 1953\u201355 and not a revolutionary upheaval . He also feared that the demonstration was a provocation by Ger\u0151 and Heged\u00fcs to frame him as inciting rebellion and to crack down on the opposition .",
      "His associates ultimately convinced him to travel to the Parliament Building and give a speech to the demonstrators to calm the unrest . While no accurate record of this speech exists , it did not have its intended effect ; Nagy essentially told the protesters to go home and let the Party handle things . The demonstrations soon escalated into a full-scale revolt as \u00c1VH secret policemen opened fire on the protesting citizens . Hungarian soldiers sent to crush the demonstrators instead sided with them , and Ger\u0151 soon called in Soviet intervention .",
      "Early in the morning of 24 October , Nagy was renamed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian Peoples Republic again , in an attempt to appease the populace . However , he was initially isolated within the government , and powerless to stop the Soviet invasion of the capital that day . The decision to call in Soviet forces had already been made by Ger\u0151 and outgoing Prime Minister Andr\u00e1s Heged\u00fcs the previous night , but many suspected that Nagy had signed the order . This perception was not helped by the fact that Nagy declared martial law on that same day and offered an amnesty to all rebels who laid down their arms , weakening the publics trust in him . The next day ( 25 October ) he announced he would begin negotiations on the withdrawal of Soviet troops after order was restored . On 26 October , he began to meet with delegations from the Writers Union and student groups , as well as from the Borsod Workers Council in Miskolc .",
      "On 27 October , Nagy announced a major reformation of his government , to include several non-communist politicians including former president Zolt\u00e1n Tildy as a Minister of State . At negotiations with Soviet representatives Anastas Mikoyan and Mikhail Suslov , Nagy and the Hungarian government delegation pushed for a ceasefire and political solution .",
      "In the morning of 28 October , Nagy successfully prevented a massive attack on the main rebel strongholds at the Corvin Cinema and Kili\u00e1n Barracks by Soviet troops and pro-regime Hungarian units . He negotiated a ceasefire with the Soviets , which came into effect at 12:15 and fighting began to die down across the city and country . Later that day , he gave a speech on the radio assessing the events as a national democratic movement , proclaiming his full support of the Revolution and agreeing to fulfill some of the publics demands . He announced the dissolution of the \u00c1VH and his intention to negotiate the full withdrawal of Soviet troops from the city . Nagy also supported the creation of a National Guard , a force of combined soldiers and armed civilians to maintain order amidst the chaos of the Revolution .",
      "On 29 October , as fighting died down across Budapest and Soviet troops began to withdraw , Nagy moved his office from the Party headquarters to the Parliament Building . He also began to meet and negotiated with several representatives of the armed groups that day , as well as the representatives of the workers councils that had been formed over the course of the previous week .",
      "By 30 October , Nagys reformist faction had gained full control of the Hungarian government . Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151 and the other Stalinist hard-liners had left for the Soviet Union , and Nagys government announced its intent to restore a multi-party system based on the coalition parties from 1945 . Throughout this period , Nagy remained steadfastly committed to Marxism ; but his conception of Marxism was as a science that cannot remain static , and he railed against the rigid dogmatism of the Stalinist monopoly . He did not intend a full return to multi-party liberal democracy but a limited one within a socialist framework , and was willing to allow the function of the pre-1948 coalition parties .",
      "Nagy was appointed to the temporary leadership committee of the newly-formed Hungarian Socialist Workers Party , which replaced the disintegrated Hungarian Working Peoples Party on 31 October . This was originally intended as a national-communist party that would preserve the gains of the Revolution . However , at a meeting of the Soviet Politburo that day , the Kremlin leaders decided that the Revolution had gone too far and needed to be crushed . On the night of 31 October \u2013 1 November , Soviet troops began crossing back into Hungary , contrary to their declaration of 30 October expressing willingness to withdraw from the country entirely . Nagy protested this action to Soviet Ambassador Yuri Andropov ; the latter replied that the new troops were only there to cover the full withdrawal and protect Soviet citizens living in Hungary . This likely prompted Nagy to make his most controversial decision . In response to a major demand of the revolutionaries , he announced Hungarys withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and appealed through the UN for the great powers , such as the United States and the United Kingdom , to recognise Hungarys status as a neutral state . Late that night , General Secretary J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r went to the Soviet embassy , and the next day he was taken to Moscow .",
      "Between 1\u20133 November , Nikita Khrushchev traveled to various Warsaw Pact countries as well as to Yugoslavia to inform them of his plans to attack Hungary . On the advice of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito , he selected the then-Party General Secretary J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r as the countrys new leader on 2 November , and was willing to let Nagy remain in the government if he cooperated . On 3 November , Nagy formed a new government , this time with a Communist minority . It included members of the Communists , Independent Smallholders Party , Peasants Party , and Social Democrats . However , it would only be in office for less than a day .",
      "In the early morning hours of 4 November , the USSR launched Operation Whirlwind , a massive military attack on Budapest and on rebel strongholds throughout the country . Nagy made a dramatic announcement to the country and the world about this operation . However , to minimize damage he ordered the Hungarian Army not to resist the invaders . Soon after , he fled to the Yugoslav Embassy , where he and many of his followers were given sanctuary .",
      "In spite of a written safe conduct of free passage by J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r , on 22 November , Nagy was arrested by the Soviet forces as he was leaving the Yugoslav Embassy and taken to Snagov , Romania .",
      "Secret trial and execution .",
      "Subsequently , the Soviets returned Nagy to Hungary , where he was secretly charged with organizing the overthrow of the Hungarian Peoples Republic and with treason . Nagy was secretly tried , found guilty , sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958 . His trial and execution were made public only after the sentence had been carried out . According to Fedor Burlatsky , a Kremlin insider , Nikita Khrushchev had Nagy executed , as a lesson to all other leaders in socialist countries . American journalist John Gunther described the events leading to Nagys death as an episode of unparalleled infamy .",
      "Nagy was buried , along with his co-defendants , in the prison yard where the executions were carried out and years later was removed to a distant corner ( section 301 ) of the New Public Cemetery , Budapest , face-down , and with his hands and feet tied with barbed wire . Next to his grave stands a memorial bell inscribed in Latin , Hungarian , German and English . The Latin reads : Vivos voco / Mortuos plango / Fulgura frango , which is translated as : I call the living , I mourn the dead , I break the thunderbolts .",
      "Memorials and political rehabilitation .",
      "During the time when the Stalinist leadership of Hungary would not permit his death to be commemorated , or permit access to his burial place , a cenotaph in his honour was erected in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 16 June 1988 .",
      "In 1989 , Imre Nagy was rehabilitated and his remains reburied on the 31st anniversary of his execution in the same plot after a funeral organised in part by the democratic opposition to the countrys Stalinist regime . Over 200,000 people are estimated to have attended Nagys reinterment . The occasion of Nagys funeral was an important factor in the end of the communist government in Hungary .",
      "On 28 December 2018 , a popular statue of Nagy inaugurated in 1996 was removed from central Budapest to a less central location , in order to make way to a reconstructed monument that had stood on location from 1934 to 1945 . Opposition parties , mainly liberal , socialist and the remaining communists accused Viktor Orb\u00e1ns right-wing government of historical revisionism .",
      "Writings .",
      "The collected writings of Nagy , most of which he wrote after his dismissal as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in April 1955 , were smuggled out of Hungary and published in the West under the title Imre Nagy on Communism .",
      "Family .",
      "Nagy was married to M\u00e1ria \u00c9get\u0151 . The couple had one daughter , Erzs\u00e9bet Nagy ( 1927\u20132008 ) , a Hungarian writer and translator . Erzs\u00e9bet Nagy married Ferenc J\u00e1nosi . Imre Nagy did not object to his daughters romance and eventual marriage to a Protestant minister , attending their religious wedding ceremony in 1946 without Politburo permission . In 1982 , Erzs\u00e9bet Nagy married J\u00e1nos V\u00e9szi .",
      "Nagy in film and the arts .",
      "In 2003 and 2004 , the Hungarian director M\u00e1rta M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros produced a film based on Nagys life after the revolution , entitled A temetetlen halott ( English : The Unburied Body ) ( IMDb entry ) .",
      "Nagy is mentioned and seen in the movie Children of Glory .",
      "The rehabilitation of Nagy after 40 years condemnation is referred to by a character in the 1991 Malayalam movie Sandhesam as part of an anti-communist rhetoric ."

      "Cutty Sark",
      "Cutty Sark is a British clipper ship . Built on the River Leven , Dumbarton , Scotland in 1869 for the Jock Willis Shipping Line , she was one of the last tea clippers to be built and one of the fastest , coming at the end of a long period of design development , which halted as sailing ships gave way to steam propulsion .",
      "The opening of the Suez Canal ( also in 1869 ) meant that steamships now enjoyed a much shorter route to China , so Cutty Sark spent only a few years on the tea trade before turning to the trade in wool from Australia , where she held the record time to Britain for ten years . Improvements in steam technology meant that gradually steamships also came to dominate the longer sailing route to Australia , and the ship was sold to the Portuguese company Ferreira and Co . in 1895 and renamed Ferreira . She continued as a cargo ship until purchased in 1922 by retired sea captain Wilfred Dowman , who used her as a training ship operating from Falmouth , Cornwall . After his death , Cutty Sark was transferred to the Thames Nautical Training College , Greenhithe in 1938 where she became an auxiliary cadet training ship alongside HMS Worcester . By 1954 , she had ceased to be useful as a cadet ship and was transferred to permanent dry dock at Greenwich , London , for public display .",
      "Cutty Sark is listed by National Historic Ships as part of the National Historic Fleet ( the nautical equivalent of a Grade 1 Listed Building ) . She is one of only three remaining original composite construction ( wooden hull on an iron frame ) clipper ships from the nineteenth century in part or whole , the others being the , which arrived in Port Adelaide , South Australia on 3 February 2014 for preservation , and the beached skeleton of Ambassador of 1869 near Punta Arenas , Chile .",
      "The ship has been damaged by fire twice in recent years , first on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation . She was restored and was reopened to the public on 25 April 2012 . On 19 October 2014 she was damaged in a smaller fire .",
      "Cutty Sark whisky derives its name from the ship . An image of the clipper appears on the label , and the maker formerly sponsored the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race . The ship also inspired the name of the Saunders Roe Cutty Sark flying boat .",
      "Construction .",
      "Cutty Sark was ordered by shipping magnate John Willis , who operated a shipping company founded by his father . The company had a fleet of clippers and regularly took part in the tea trade from China to Britain . Speed was a clear advantage to a merchant ship , but it also created prestige for the owners : the tea race was widely reported in contemporary newspapers and had become something of a national sporting event , with money being gambled against a winning ship . In earlier years , Willis had commanded his fathers ships at a time when American designed ships were the fastest in the tea trade , and then had owned British designed ships , which were amongst the best available in the world but had never won the tea race . In 1868 the brand new Aberdeen built clipper Thermopylae set a record time of 61 days port to port on her maiden voyage from London to Melbourne and it was this design that Willis set out to better .",
      "It is uncertain how the hull shape for Cutty Sark was chosen . Willis chose Hercules Linton to design and build the ship but Willis already possessed another ship , The Tweed , which he considered to have exceptional performance . The Tweed ( originally Punjaub ) was a frigate designed by Oliver Lang based on the lines of an old French frigate , built in Bombay for the East India Company as a combination sail/paddle steamer . She and a sister ship were purchased by Willis , who promptly sold the second ship plus engines from The Tweed for more than he paid for both . The Tweed was then lengthened and operated as a fast sailing vessel , but was considered too big for the tea runs . Willis also commissioned two all-iron clippers with designs based upon The Tweed , Halloween and Blackadder . Linton was taken to view The Tweed in dry dock .",
      "Willis considered that The Tweeds bow shape was responsible for its notable performance , and this form seems to have been adopted for Cutty Sark . Linton , however , felt that the stern was too barrel shaped and so gave Cutty Sark a squarer stern with less tumblehome . The broader stern increased the buoyancy of the ships stern , making it lift more in heavy seas so it was less likely that waves would break over the stern , and over the helmsman at the wheel . The square bilge was carried forward through the centre of the ship . Cutty Sark was given masts that followed the design of The Tweed , with similar good rake and the foremast on both placed further aft than usual .",
      "A contract for Cutty Sarks construction was signed on 1 February 1869 with the firm of Scott & Linton , which had only been formed in May 1868 . Their shipyard was at Dumbarton on the River Leven on a site previously occupied by shipbuilders William Denny & Brothers . The contract required the ship to be completed within six months at a contracted price of \u00a317 per ton and maximum weight of 950 tons . This was a highly competitive price for an experimental , state-of-the-art vessel , and for a customer requiring the highest standards . Payment would be made in seven instalments as the ship progressed , but with a penalty of \u00a35 for every day the ship was late . The ship was to be built to Lloyds A1 standard and her construction was supervised on behalf of Willis by Captain George Moodie , who would command her when completed . Construction delays occurred when the Lloyds inspectors required additional strengthening in the ship .",
      "Work on the ship was suspended when Scott and Linton ran out of money to continue . Rather than simply liquidate the company , an arrangement was made for Dennys to take over the contract and complete the ship , which was finally launched on 22 November 1869 by Captain Moodies wife . The ship was moved to Dennys yard to have her masts fitted , and then on 20 December towed downriver to Greenock to have her running rigging installed . In the event , completing the ship meant the companys creditors were owed even more money than when work had first been halted .",
      "Cutty Sarks length was , with a draft of and a deadweight of 921 tons . Broadly , the parts of the ship visible above the waterline were constructed from East India teak , while American rock elm was used for the ships bottom . The stem , , and sternpost , , were of teak while the rudder was of English oak . The keel was replaced in the 1920s with one constructed from pitch pine . The deck was made of thick teak while the tween deck was yellow pine . The keel , , had on either side a garboard strake , , and then planking decreasing to at 1/5 the depth of the hold . Teak planking began at approximately the level of the bilge stringer . The hull was covered by Muntz metal sheeting up to the depth mark , and all the external timbers were secured by Muntz metal bolts to the internal iron frame . The wrought-iron frame was an innovation in shipbuilding . It consisted of frames ( vertical ) , beams ( horizontal ) and cross bracing ( diagonal members ) .",
      "The diagonally-braced iron frame made for a strong , rigid ship ; diagonal members prevent racking ( shearing , where frame rectangles become parallelograms ) . Less and leaking of the hull meant less crew time spent pumping , allowing more time to be spent on changes of sail . The wrought-iron-framed hull also took up less cargo space than an all-wood hull would have done . The Muntz metal sheeting reduced fouling of Cutty Sarks hull ; with a cleaner hull , she could sail faster .",
      "Performance .",
      "The maximum logged speed for Cutty Sark was . Her greatest recorded distance in noon to noon sights was averaging , although she recorded in six days , which given the weather over the whole period implied she had achieved over some days . By comparison , Thermopylaes best recorded 24-hour distance was . On another occasion she recorded in 11 days . Cutty Sark was considered to have the edge in a heavier wind , and Thermopylae in a lighter wind .",
      "Name .",
      "The ship was named after Cutty-sark , the nickname of the witch Nannie Dee in Robert Burnss 1791 poem Tam o Shanter . The ships figurehead , the original of which has been attributed to carver Fredrick Hellyer of Blackwall , is a stark white carving of a bare-breasted Nannie Dee with long black hair holding a grey horses tail in her hand . In the poem she wore a linen ( Scots : a short chemise or undergarment ) , that she had been given as a child , which explains why it was cutty , or in other words far too short . The erotic sight of her dancing in such a short undergarment caused Tam to cry out Weel done , Cutty-sark , which subsequently became a well known catchphrase . Originally , carvings by Hellyer of the other scantily clad witches followed behind the figurehead along the bow , but these were removed by Willis in deference to good taste . Tam o Shanter riding Meg was to be seen along the ships quarter . The motto Where theres a Willis away was inscribed along the taffrail . The Tweed , which acted as a model for much of the ship which followed her , had a figurehead depicting Tam o Shanter .",
      "History .",
      "First tea seasons .",
      "Cutty Sark was destined for the tea trade , then an intensely competitive race across the globe from China to London . Though the premium or bonus paid to the ship that arrived with the first tea of the year was abandoned after the Great Tea Race of 1866 , faster ships could usually obtain a higher price for transporting their cargoes than others . Her first round trip voyage under captain George Moodie began 16 February 1870 from London with a cargo of wine , spirits and beer bound for Shanghai . The return journey , carrying 1,305,812 lbs of tea from Shanghai , began 25 June , arriving 13 October in London via the Cape of Good Hope .",
      "Cutty Sark sailed in eight tea seasons , from London to China and back .",
      "Competition from steamers .",
      "Cutty Sarks launch coincided with the opening of the Suez Canal to shipping . Her first trip encountered significant competition with steamships . The route from the Far East to London ( and many other European ports ) through the Suez Canal was shorter by about , compared to sailing round the Cape of Good Hope . The route round Africa is in excess of . Typically a clipper might log significantly more than that by planning her route for favourable winds . Whilst it was possible for a sailing vessel to take a tug through the canal , this was difficult and expensive . Furthermore , sailing conditions in the northern Red Sea were unsuited to the design of a tea clipper , so they still had to sail around Africa .",
      "Less obviously , steamship design had taken a large step forward in 1866 with Agamemnon , using higher boiler pressure and a compound engine , so obtaining a large improvement in fuel efficiency . Ships of this type could compete with clippers before the Suez Canal opened .",
      "When the tea clippers arrived in China in 1870 , they found a big increase in the number of steamers , which were in high demand . The rate of freight to London that was given to steamers was nearly twice that paid to the sailing ships . Additionally , the insurance premium for a cargo of tea in a steamer was substantially less than for a sailing vessel . So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that , in 1871 , 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade .",
      "The numbers of tea clippers sailing to China each year steadily reduced , with many ships being sold and moving to general cargo work . Costs were kept to a minimum and rigs were often reduced to barque so that a smaller crew was needed .",
      "Thermopylae .",
      "Cutty Sarks well known race against Thermopylae took place in 1872 , the two ships leaving Shanghai together on 18 June . Both ships were of similar size : length , beam and depths were within of each other . The Thermopylae had a slightly larger capacity : 991 compared to 963 ( GRT ) or 948 compared to 921 ( net ) . Two weeks later Cutty Sark had built up a lead of some , but then lost her rudder in a heavy gale after passing through the Sunda Strait . John Williss brother was on board the ship and ordered Moodie to put into Cape Town for repairs . Moodie refused , and instead the ships carpenter Henry Henderson constructed a new rudder from spare timbers and iron . This took six days , working in gales and heavy seas which meant the men were tossed about as they worked and the brazier used to heat the metal for working was spilled out , burning the captains son . The ship finally arrived in London on 18 October a week after Thermopylae , a total passage of 122 days . The captain and crew were commended for their performance and Henderson received a \u00a350 bonus for his work . This was the closest Cutty Sark came to being first ship home but it was Moodies last trip as her captain before he transferred to steamships . He was replaced by Captain F . W . Moore .",
      "Later tea seasons .",
      "Moore remained captain only for one round trip to China , taking 117 days for the return trip . This was 14 days longer than Thermopylae and 27 days longer than achieved by the iron ship Halloween a few months later . Captain W . E . Tiptaft assumed command in 1873 achieving 118 days on his first return trip , but after the ship had to travel 600 miles up the Yangtze River in search of a cargo . Steamships were now taking most of the tea . The following year the return journey took 122 days , but on the outward journey Cutty Sark set a record time of 73 days from London to Sydney . In November 1877 the ship was anchored off Deal in the English Channel along with sixty other vessels , waiting out a great storm . The anchor failed to hold and Cutty Sark was blown through the ships , damaging two others before grounding on a mud bank . Fortunately she was pulled clear by the tug Macgregor before too much damage was caused and she was towed to the Thames for repairs .",
      "In December 1877 the ship sailed from London to Sydney , where she took on coal for Shanghai , arriving there in April . However , the ship was unable to find any cargo of tea for a return trip to London\u2014the days of the tea race were over . The master , Captain Tiptaft , died in October while still in Shanghai and was replaced by the first mate , James Wallace . The ship now had to take different cargoes around the world , including coal , jute , castor oil and tea to Australia .",
      "In 1880 yards were shortened and the stunsails removed . Also in 1880 an incident occurred on board during which the First Mate Sidney Smith killed seaman John Francis . Smith was allowed to leave the ship at Anjer by Captain Wallace , causing the crew to cease work in protest . Wallace continued the voyage with six apprentices and four tradesmen but became becalmed in the Java Sea for three days . In desperation as matters moved from bad to worse , he committed suicide by jumping overboard and disappeared . He was replaced as Master by William Bruce , who proved to be a drunken incompetent who claimed pay for non-existent crewmen and managed to set sail with inadequate provisions , resulting in the crew starving . An inquiry in New York in April 1882 resulted in the captain and mate being suspended and replaced by Captain Moore , previously of Blackadder .",
      "Wool trade .",
      "In December 1883 , Cutty Sark departed Newcastle , New South Wales with 4,289 bales of wool and 12 casks of tallow , arriving in London in just 83 days . This was 25 days faster than her nearest rival that year and heralded the start of a new career taking Australian wool to Britain in time for the January wool sales .",
      "From 1885 to 1893 , Cutty Sark was run between England and New South Wales under the agency of the Sydney based Dangar , Gedye & Co . In 1885 Richard Woodget was appointed captain on a salary of \u00a3186 per year ( \u00a323,729.80 in 2019 when adjusted for inflation ) and continued to improve on the fastest trip record , achieving 77 days on his first outward trip and 73 days returning to Britain from Australia . He achieved this by taking a more southerly route than previously , to catch the strongest winds in the Roaring Forties despite having to face icebergs , gales and storms whipped up by the winds he sought . Cutty Sark was the fastest ship on the wool trade for ten years . In July 1889 the log of the modern passenger steamship recorded that when steaming at 15\u201316 knots she was overtaken in the night by a sailing ship doing 17 knots , which proved to be Cutty Sark .",
      "As Ferreira .",
      "Eventually steamships began to dominate the wool trade too and it ceased to be profitable for a sailing ship . In 1895 Jock Willis sold Cutty Sark to the Portuguese firm Joaquim Antunes Ferreira for \u00a31,250 . She was renamed Ferreira after the firm . Her crews referred to her as Pequena Camisola ( little shirt , a straight translation of the Scots cutty sark ) .",
      "The ship traded various cargoes between Portugal , Rio de Janeiro , New Orleans , Mozambique , Angola , and Britain . In May 1916 she was dismasted off the Cape of Good Hope because of the rolling of the ship in bad weather and had to be towed into Table Bay off Cape Town . Because of World War I , it was impossible to obtain suitable materials to replace the masts so she was re-rigged over 18 months to a barquentine sail arrangement .",
      "In 1922 Ferreira was the last clipper operating anywhere in the world . Caught in a storm in the English Channel she put into Falmouth harbour where she was spotted by retired merchant navy captain Wilfred Dowman of Flushing , Cornwall , who was then operating the training ship Lady of Avenel . The ship returned to Lisbon , where she was sold to new owners and renamed Maria do Amparo ( Mary of the Refuge , a name associated with the devotion of Our Lady of the Refuge ; in Portuguese , Nossa Senhora do Amparo ) .",
      "As cadet training ship .",
      "Dowman persevered in his determination to buy the ship , which he did for \u00a33,750 and she was returned to Falmouth harbour . The purchase was made with the support of Dowmans wife , artist Catharine Dowman ( ) , heiress daughter of Sydney Courtauld , crepe and silk manufacturer .",
      "The rigging was restored to an approximation of the original arrangement and the ship was used as a cadet training ship . In 1924 she was used as committee boat for the regatta week in Fowey during that years regatta week as recalled to me by Mr . Arthur ( Toby ) West . As a historic survivor , the ship was opened to the public and visitors would be rowed out to inspect her . Dowman died in 1936 and the ship was given by Catharine Dowman , his widow , along with \u00a35000 for maintenance , to the Incorporated Thames Nautical Training College , HMS Worcester at Greenhithe . She was towed to Greenhithe by tug . The ship was crewed by cadets , 15-year-old Robert Wyld steering the ship during the voyage .",
      "At Greenhithe Cutty Sark acted as an auxiliary vessel to for sail training drill , but by 1950 she had become surplus to requirements . From February to October 1951 she was temporarily moved first for a refit and then to take part in the Festival of Britain at Deptford . On 30 January 1952 , the 800-ton tanker collided with Cutty Sarks bow in the Thames . The two ships were locked together after the collision which forced Cutty Sarks jibboom into Worcesters forecastle rails , snapping the boom before scraping along Worcesters starboard side . Cutty Sarks figurehead lost an arm in the process . Cutty Sark was anchored and towed to the Shadwell Basin where repairs were carried out by Green & Silley Weir Ltd . The damaged arm was recovered at Grays Thurrock and the figurehead was repaired .",
      "Museum ship .",
      "In 1953 Cutty Sark was given to the Cutty Sark Preservation Society and in 1954 she was moved to a custom-built dry dock at Greenwich . She was stripped of upper masts , yards , deck-houses and ballast to lighten her before being towed from the East India Import Dock to the special dry dock at Greenwich . The skipper on this occasion was 83-year-old Captain C.E . Irving , who had sailed the world three times in her before he was 17 . The river pilot was Ernest Coe . Thereafter the entrance tunnel to the dry dock was filled in , the river wall rebuilt and the work of re-rigging began . The foundation stone of the dry dock was laid by The Duke of Edinburgh , patron of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society , in June 1953 . The restoration , re-rigging and preparation for public exhibition was estimated to cost \u00a3250,000 .",
      "Cutty Sark was preserved as a museum ship , and has since become a popular tourist attraction , and part of the National Historic Fleet . She is located near the centre of Greenwich , in south-east London , close aboard the National Maritime Museum , the former Greenwich Hospital , and Greenwich Park . She is also a prominent landmark on the route of the London Marathon . She usually flies signal flags from her ensign halyard reading JKWS , which is the code representing Cutty Sark in the International Code of Signals , introduced in 1857 .",
      "The ship is in the care of the Cutty Sark Trust , whose president , the Duke of Edinburgh , was instrumental in ensuring her preservation , when he set up the Cutty Sark Society in 1951 . The Trust replaced the Society in 2000 . She is a Grade I listed monument and was on the Buildings At Risk Register following the 2007 fire . The gallery beneath the ship holds the worlds largest collection of ships figureheads , donated to the Society by Sydney Cumbers in 1953 .",
      "Cutty Sark station on the Docklands Light Railway is one minutes walk away , with connections to central London and the London Underground . Greenwich Pier is next to the ship , and is served by scheduled river boats from piers in central London . A tourist information office stands to the east of the ship .",
      "Conservation and fire .",
      "By the early 2000s , there were serious concerns about corrosion of the iron internal structure , and the hull was also becoming distorted because more weight was being carried on the keel than if the ship was afloat , when it would be evenly supported over the whole area below the waterline . An extensive conservation project was planned to overcome this , including repair and anti-corrosion painting of the framework and the addition of some additional steel ribs to add strength , and a new method of supporting the ship .",
      "On the morning of 21 May 2007 , Cutty Sark , which had been closed and partly dismantled for conservation work , caught fire , and burned for several hours before the London Fire Brigade could bring the fire under control . Initial reports indicated that the damage was extensive , with most of the wooden structure in the centre having been lost .",
      "In an interview the next day , Richard Doughty , the chief executive of the Cutty Sark Trust , revealed that at least half of the fabric ( timbers , etc. ) of the ship had not been on site as it had been removed during the preservation work . Doughty stated that the trust was most worried about the state of iron framework to which the fabric was attached . He did not know how much more the ship would cost to restore , but estimated it at an additional \u00a35\u201310 million , bringing the total cost of the ships restoration to \u00a330\u201335 million .",
      "In initial investigations , the possibility was covered that the fire might have been started deliberately . The fire was later found to have most likely been caused by an industrial vacuum cleaner which had been left running over the weekend , compounded by the absence of the overnight fire watchers .",
      "In a second incident on the morning of 19 October 2014 , another fire broke out on the deck of the Cutty Sark . A small part of deck three and the hull timbers were damaged in the blaze . The London Fire Brigade managed to contain the blaze within an hour and she was reopened to the public shortly after .",
      "Damage .",
      "Aerial video footage showed extensive damage , but seemed to indicate that the ship had not been destroyed in her entirety by the 2007 fire . A fire officer present at the scene said in a BBC interview that when they arrived , there had been a well-developed fire throughout the ship . The bow section looked to be relatively unscathed and the stern also appeared to have survived without major damage ; the fire seemed to have been concentrated in the centre of the ship . The chairman of Cutty Sark Enterprises said after inspecting the site : The decks are unsalvageable but around 50% of the planking had already been removed ; however , the damage is not as bad as originally expected .",
      "As part of the restoration work planned before the fire , it was proposed that the ship be raised , to allow the construction of a state-of-the-art museum space beneath . This would allow visitors to view her from below .",
      "There was criticism of the policies of the Cutty Sark Trust and its stance that the most important thing was to preserve as much as possible of the original fabric . Proponents of making her fit to go to sea advocated that the fire repairs be done in such a manner to enable her to do so .",
      "However , the state of the timbers , especially the keel , and the fact that a hole had been cut through the hull in the 1950s for an access door , made this difficult . The Cutty Sark Trust said that less than five percent of the original fabric was lost in the fire , as the decks which were destroyed were additions not present at the original building .",
      "The restoration work was criticised by The Victorian Society saying that the needs of the corporate hospitality market were put ahead of the preservation of the historic fabric of the ship . Building Design magazine awarded the project its Carbuncle Cup for the worst new building completed in 2012 saying The schemes myriad failings stem from one calamitous choice : the decision to hoick the 144-year-old clipper close to three metres into the air on canted steel props .",
      "Fundraising .",
      "The design for the renovation project by Grimshaw architects with , during design development stage , newly established Youmeheshe architects and Buro Happold engineers involved raising the ship out of her dry berth using a Kevlar web , allowing visitors to pass under the hull to view it . Unfortunately it was discovered that the proposed web would not follow the reverse curves of the ships hull which would effectively mask the hulls shape from view . An alternate design for the support of the ship had to be developed ; this involved installing a deep steel belt around the hull tied by diagonal steel members passing through the hold to a new steel-reinforced keel . Horizontal tubular steel struts passing through the hold brace the diagonals apart while many of the corroded original hull frames have been doubled .",
      "A new steelwork lower deck of contemporary design incorporating an amphitheatre feature was installed in the main hold while a glass-encased lift installed within the ship terminates in a new steel-and-glass housing structure on the weather deck . A second new steel-and-glass box has been installed above the forehold to enclose a new staircase . Access to the ship is through a new opening cut through the hull below the waterline in the ships starboard quarter . The new access hole has required the addition of new steel framing . Visitors arriving on board the ship now do so via this entrance , which leads to the lower hold . Maldwin Drummond , Chairman of the Cutty Sark Trust , has explained in Classic Boat magazines September 2010 issue the need to retain the spirit of the ship and he quotes the ideal that The visitor should see the ship as though for some unexplained reason the crew had gone ashore . Doubts over the wisdom of Grimshaws proposals have been raised by many ship conservationists including the Cutty Sark Trusts own engineer Peter Mason .",
      "The project was costed at \u00a325 million when it commenced in 2006 with \u00a311.75 million of this total being provided by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund .",
      "Oscar-winning film producer Jerry Bruckheimer aided in the repair and restoration of Cutty Sark . A collection of photos taken by Bruckheimer went on display in London in November 2007 to help raise money for the Cutty Sark Conservation Project . The exhibition featured more than thirty pictures taken on set during the filming of .",
      "In January 2008 , the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the Cutty Sark Trust another \u00a310 million towards the restoration of the ship , meaning that the Trust had now achieved \u00a330 million of the \u00a335 million needed for the completion of the project . In June 2008 , Israeli shipping magnate Sammy Ofer donated the outstanding \u00a33.3 million needed to fully restore the ship although by January 2009 the London Evening Standard reported that the cost had risen further to \u00a340 million creating a new shortfall .",
      "In February 2010 , The Daily Telegraph reported the project cost had risen to \u00a346 million with public money now being made available by London Borough of Greenwich to fill the funding gap .",
      "Investigation conclusion .",
      "On 30 September 2008 , the London Fire Brigade announced the conclusion of the investigation into the fire at a press conference at New Scotland Yard . The painstaking investigation was conducted by the Fire Brigade , along with Londons Metropolitan Police Service , Forensic Science Services , and electrical examination experts Dr . Burgoynes & Partners . They said that the most likely cause was the failure of an industrial vacuum cleaner that may have been left switched on over the weekend before the fire started . The report revealed no evidence that the ship was subjected to arson attack and concluded that the fire started accidentally .",
      "Physical evidence and CCTV footage of the fire showed that it probably started towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck . All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship . No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off at the end of each day , and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question . The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating . This was not conclusive evidence , however , because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire , and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function . Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear , if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire . This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris . The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced .",
      "On the basis of witness evidence , the joint investigation team considered it unlikely that the fire was caused by the hot work ( welding ) that was being carried out as part of the renovation or by carelessly discarded smokers materials . No one had visited this part of the ship since work stopped on Friday evening , and it was considered unlikely that a fire could have smouldered all weekend before finally breaking out Monday morning . However , it was discovered that although all hot work was supposed to be recorded and someone was supposed to check afterwards to ensure of no fires , there was no record that such checks had ever been made , and on at least one occasion hot work had been conducted with no records made .",
      "The ship was patrolled by two security guards , both of whom were supposed to patrol independently at least once an hour , or once every two hours later in the night , one being primarily responsible for the visitor pavilion and one for the dock . The guards were required to keep a log of their patrols , but after the fire the relevant page was found to be missing from the book . It was later found , already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 am when the guards would have gone off duty . The alarm was raised when one of the guards called the fire brigade ; before this the two reported that they had smelled burning plastic and had been investigating to try to determine its source .",
      "A carpenter had visited the site on Sunday to collect some tools , but after 20 minutes attempting to contact a security guard to let him in , had climbed the fence , collected his tools and climbed out again . The carpenter reported that he had heard machinery operating towards the stern of the ship , but it was not clear whether this might have been the site diesel generator which ran at all times .",
      "The ship was fitted with a temporary fire alarm system but it was unclear whether this had operated . A separate alarm within the pavilion did sound when smoke and heat reached that area , but the guards reported no ringing alarm before the fire was seen . Investigation afterwards discovered a faulty relay in the alarm panel which failed to switch power to the siren circuits when an alarm was triggered . However , the panel also contained a failed fuse in one siren circuit which suggested that the siren had activated but the fire shorted it out , and this might have also caused the relay to fail . The failed relay would have shut off power to the second siren circuit . Statements from workers suggested that weekly tests of the alarm system had not been carried out .",
      "Mast specifications .",
      "The original mast specifications as laid down by the ships designer still exist and are listed below as tea rig . This arrangement was used during the ships time on the tea trade route , where it was necessary to maximise the area of sail to get the greatest possible propulsion when the ship might be becalmed in the doldrums . For the route to Australia it was not necessary to carry such a large area of sail and the masts and yards were reduced . The tradewinds required great strength in masts , but the wind could best be captured by relatively small , high sails . A smaller rig also represented a saving in maintenance costs . Each of the three masts ( fore , main and mizzen ) is in three overlapping sections ."

      "The 6th Army was a field army of the Soviet Red Army formed four times during World War II and active with the Russian Ground Forces until 1998 . It appears to have been reformed in 2010 .",
      "It was first formed in August , 1939 in the Kiev Special Military District from the Volochiskaya Army Group ( a corps-sized formation ) .",
      "First Formation .",
      "In September 1939 it participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland . At the beginning of war the Army ( 6th Rifle Corps , 37th Rifle Corps ( which included the 80th , 139th , and 141st Rifle Divisions ) , 4th and 15th Mechanized Corps , 5th Cavalry Corps , 4th Fortified Region , and 6th Fortified Region ( Rava-Ruska ) , and a number of artillery and other units ) was deployed on the Lviv direction . It started the Second World War as part of the Soviet Southwestern Front . The armys headquarters was disbanded 10 August 1941 after the Battle of Uman . In this battle , the 6th Army was caught in a huge encirclement south of Kiev along with the 12th Army .",
      "Second Formation .",
      "It was immediately reformed within the Southern Front on the basis of 48th Rifle Corps and other units , and defended the west bank of the Dnepr River northwest of Dnipropetrovsk . On 1 September 1941 it consisted of 169th , 226th , 230th , 255th , 273rd , and 275th Rifle Divisions , 26th and 28th Cavalry Divisions , 47th Rifle Regiment ( 15th NKVD Rifle Division ) , 269th , 274th , and 394th Corps Artillery Regiments , 522nd High-power Howitzer Artillery Regiment \u0433\u0430\u043f \u0431/\u043c , 671st Artillery Regiment of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command ( \u0430\u043f \u0420\u0412\u0413\u041a ) , 14th , 27th Separate Anti-Aircraft Artillery Divisions , and 8th Tank Division . It was then transferred to the Soviet Southwestern Front and took part in defensive actions in the Donbas , the Barvenkovo-Lozovaia operation , and the Second Battle of Kharkov , but along with the 57th Army , was surrounded in the Izium pocket with the loss of 200,000 plus men in casualties alone , and afterwards formally disbanded .",
      "Third Formation .",
      "The Army was reformed in July 1942 for the third time from the 6th Reserve Army , comprising the 45th , 99th , 141st , 160th , 174th , 212th , 219th , and 309th Rifle Divisions plus the 141st Rifle Brigade . It was assigned in sequence to the Voronezh , Southwestern , and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts . In January 1943 , the 6th Army smashed through the defensive lines of the Alpini divisions of the Italian 8th Army as part of Operation Little Saturn .",
      "In September 1943 it consisted of the 4th Guards Rifle Corps ( 38th Guards , 263rd , 267th Rifle Divisions ) , 26th Guards Rifle Corps ( 25th Guards , 35th and 47th Guards Rifle Divisions ) , and the 33rd Rifle Corps ( 50th , 78th , 243rd Rifle Divisions ) .",
      "In 1944 it took part in the Nikopol-Kryvyi Rih , Bereznogova-Snigorovka , and Odessa offensives . Disbanded in June 1944 .",
      "Fourth Formation .",
      "Reformed in December 1944 with troops from 3rd Guards and 13th Armies . On 1 January 1945 the Army consisted of the 22nd Rifle Corps ( 218th and 273rd Rifle Divisions ) , the 74th Rifle Corps ( 181st and 309th Rifle Divisions ) , the 359th Rifle Division , the 77th Fortified Region , and other support units .",
      "During 1945 the Army took part in the Sandomierz\u2013Silesia , and the Lower Silesia offensives . During the Lower Silesia offensive in February 1945 , 6th Army , commanded by Marshal Ivan Koniev , besieged Fortress Breslau ( Festung Breslau ) in the Battle of Breslau . The army besieged the city on February 13 , 1945 , and the encirclement of Breslau was completed the following day . The 1st Ukrainian Front forces besieged the city with the 22nd and 74th Rifle Corps , and the 77th Fortified Region , as well as other smaller units . Even approximate estimates vary greatly concerning the number of German troops trapped in Breslau . Some sources claim that there were as many as 150,000 defenders , some 80,000 and some 50,000 . The Siege of Breslau consisted of destructive house-to-house street fighting . The city was bombarded to ruin by artillery of the 6th Army , as well as the 2nd Air Army and the 18th Air Army . During the siege , both sides resorted to setting entire districts of the city on fire .",
      "After the end of the Second World War , the 6th Army was withdrawn from Germany and stationed briefly in the Orel Military District before being disbanded in the Voronezh Military District late in 1945 .",
      "Fifth Formation .",
      "Its fifth formation was ( re ) formed from 31st Rifle Corps on 2 April 1952 in Murmansk , Murmansk Oblast . That year it comprised the 45th Rifle Division ( Pechenga , Murmansk Oblast ) ; the 67th Rifle Division ( Murmansk , Murmansk Oblast ) ; the 341st Rifle Division ( Alakurtti , Murmansk Oblast ) ; and the 367th Rifle Division ( Sortavala , Karelian ASSR ) . The army was disbanded at Murmansk in early 1960 .",
      "The army was reformed again from Headquarters Northern Military District in May\u2013June 1960 with headquarters at Petrozavodsk . On 15 January 1974 , it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner .",

The coordination and centralized defense mechanisms scale better for large entities ; these have fueled additional consolidation .",
      "\u2022 The Domain Name System ( DNS ) , which presumed deep hierarchies but has often been deployed in large , flat zones , leading to the nameservers for those zones becoming critical infrastructure . Future developments in DNS may see concentration through the use of globally available common resolver services , which evolve rapidly and can offer better security . Paradoxically , concentration of these queries into a few services creates new security and privacy concerns .",
      "\u2022 The Web , which is built on a fundamentally decentralized design but is now often delivered with the aid of Content Delivery Networks ( CDNs ) . Their services provide scaling , distribution , and prevention of denial of service in ways that new entrants and smaller systems operators would find difficult to replicate . While truly small services and truly large services may each operate using only their own infrastructure , many others are left with the only practical choice being the use of a globally available commercial service .",

Since the games launch , the game has gone through five editions , making the rules and background more complex . The basic rules of the fourth edition of The Dark Eye were published in 2001 , and was the first edition to be released in English ( in October 2003 ) . The fifth edition of the game was released in August 2015 , with an English translation released in November 2016 .",

The trademark Realms of Arkania was owned by the now-defunct Sir-tech Software , Inc. , which spurred the name change to The Dark Eye ; Fantasy Productions was unable to obtain the trademark . In April 2007 , Ulisses Spiele assumed the TDE pen-and-paper licence from Fantasy Productions .",
      "Game history .",
      "First edition ( 1984 ) .",
      "The German first edition ( 1984 ) was translated into Dutch ( ) , French ( ) and Italian ( ) , but not into English . It has a very simple class and level system . It was published in ( The Dark Eye\u2014Adventure Base Game ) . Advanced rules were published in 1985 in the book ( Extended adventure\u2014Additional equipment for all adventures ) .",
      "Character .",
      "The character ( called Hero in the rules ) is defined by five qualities ( or attributes ) : ( courage ) , ( wisdom ) , ( same ) , ( agility ) and ( strength ) . They are determined by 1d6+7 in dice notation ( 8\u201313 ) . The weight the character can carry is equal to strength \u00d7 100 ounces ( 1 aventurian ounce is 25 g ) .",
      "The player can choose five different character types ( or classes ) : adventurer , warrior , dwarf , elf and mage . All characters can be adventurers , but there are attribute conditions to access the other types ( for example , a warrior must have at least 12 in both courage and strength ) .",
      "During the adventures , the character gains adventure points ; with a sufficient number of adventure points , they can go to the next level . When attaining a new level the character can increase an attribute by one point , and either the attack or parry value by one point ; they also win vitality points equal to one dice roll , or vitality or astral energy points equal to one dice roll for elves and mages . The extended rules add a sixth quality to the heros definition : stamina . The initial stamina is the sum of the force and vitality points . Stamina represents resistance to exhaustion ; it decreases when the hero makes physical efforts such as running , swimming and fighting .",
      "The extended rules also provide four more classes that can be chosen during the creation of the character , or sometimes as an evolution of an adventurer or dwarf : rider , druid , priest or wood elf . It introduces the aptitudes ( skills ) that are chances to manage definite actions ( such as horseback riding or camouflage ) , whereas the qualities are generic indicators . The aptitudes range between 0 and 18 ( and are tested with a d20 in dice notation ) . They have a base value ( some are part of the culture , or are simple tasks ) . When the character reaches a new level , the player can distribute 10 points to raise the aptitudes . The base value and the cost to increase depend on the type of hero ( riding is easier for a warrior than for a mage ) ; the cost also depends on the current aptitude level .",
      "Health .",
      "The character type determines the starting value of vitality points ( from 20 for a mage to 35 for a dwarf ) . This is to be compared with the 1d6+4 ( dice notation ) damage points inflicted by a sword .",
      "In the extended rules , stamina plays a role in the healing of diseases ( such as a fever ) ; when it is 20 or more spontaneous healing is possible , and it is faster when stamina is above 25 .",
      "Resolution of actions .",
      "Actions are resolved by testing the attributes ; the action succeeds when :",
      "The modifier is positive when the action is difficult , and negative when it is easy . The extended rules introduce the aptitudes , which are tested in the same way as the qualities .",
      "Combat .",
      "In fights , the characters act in decreasing order of initiative ( the character with the highest initiative acts first ) . Characters have attack and parry values determined by various other values . Typical attack/parry values for a new character are in the range of 14/12 ( for fighters ) to something like 6/8 ( dedicated non-fighters , such as priests of the goddess Tsa ) . When the attack test of the attacker is successful and the defender misses the parry test , the defender loses the number of vitality points equal to the damage of the weapon minus the protection rating of the armor ( chain mail has a protection rating of four , and knight armour has six ) . When the attacker rolls one or two on the die , they make a master hit ; the maximum damage is inflicted , and the armour does not protect .",
      "The extended rules provide for miniature figures which allow a finer representation of movement , with ( for example ) the possibility to push back an enemy . They also offer various possibilities such as fleeing , charging and successive attacks from the same fighter ( assault ) .",
      "They replace the master hit with the notions of good attack ( the attacker makes a throw equal to or less than the good attack score , as shown on a table in relation to her attack score ) and good parry ( five points less than the parry score with the d20 in dice notation ) . A good attack not parried by a good parry implies a serious ( or critical ) impact ( throw 1d20 and read the result on a table ) . When the attack or parry-test die shows 20 , this can lead to a fumble . The extended rules also allow dodging thrown weapons , introduce specific rules for empty-hand and horseback fighting and infection ( fever ) for wounds .",
      "Magic .",
      "Elves , druids , shamans , witches and mages can cast spells and have astral energy points ; the starting value of astral energy points depends on the attribute values the hero has when created . The system is based on the memory of the player ; the player must speak the formula without reading it during the game . When the formula is correct the spell is cast , and the character loses astral energy points corresponding to the spell .",
      "The extended rules introduce new spells . From the fifth level on , it is no longer necessary to speak the words to cast the spell . These rules also describe spells for the druids and wood elves , and priests miracles : manifestations of the priests god , which are similar to magic spells . The priests do not have astral energy but karma , which works the same way .",
      "First-edition advanced rules ( The Sword Masters , 1988 ) .",
      "Two sets , ( TDE Professional\u2014Sword Masters Set I ) and ( TDE Professional II\u2014The Sword Masters Feast ) , were published in 1988 and 1989 . This edition was published as advanced rules for the first edition , but is sometimes erroneously considered the second edition . Combat rules are much more elaborate , introducing a hit-location system .",
      "It was written for advanced-level characters ( typically level 15 ) . The sets describe a new world : Tharun ( pronounced taroon ) , a hollow world . It is the inside of Ethra , lightened by a central sun . Nine archipelagos constitute the realm of this world . A pantheon of nine deities rules over the inhabitants . Divine runes ( one of the only sources of magic which can be used by magicians and druids ) are scattered all over the world . The sets also provide a divine quest . A third set of campaigns was planned , but has not been released . The Tharun setting was abandoned , but it is said that the world and its pantheon still exist ; some deities are worshiped in Myranor .",
      "Second edition ( 1988 ) .",
      "The second edition was published in 1988 . The character is defined by the same five positive attributes ( qualities ) as in the first edition , as well as five new negative ones : ( superstition ) , ( acrophobia ) , ( claustrophobia ) , ( avarice ) and ( necrophobia ) . The positive attributes are determined by 1d6+7 in dice notation ( 8\u201313 ) , and the negative by 1d6+1 ( 2\u20137 ) . The player can choose from over 40 different character types ( classes ) . Again , there are attributes ( conditions ) to access the types . A character also features over 80 skills , called talents ; the use of a talent requires testing three attributes , and the character is able to cast over 100 ( 11\u00d711 ) spells .",
      "Third edition and Realms of Arkania ( 1993 ) .",
      "The third edition ( 1993 ) was used ( with a few limitations ) to power the three Realms of Arkania computer games : ( 1993 ) , Attic/Sir-Tech ) , ( 1994 , Attic/Sir-Tech ) and ( 1997 , Attic/Sir-Tech ) . Realms of Arkania was also the name of three translated novels : RoA : The Charlatan ( January 1996 , ) , RoA : The Lioness ( March 1996 , ) and RoA : The Sacrifice ( September 1996 , ) .",
      "The rules are similar to the second edition except for two additional positive attributes : ( dexterity ) and ( intuition ) ; and two additional negative attributes : ( curiosity ) and ( violent temper ) . The character is thus defined by seven positive and seven negative attributes ( qualities ) , and this edition uses the same system of talents .",
      "Fourth edition ( 2001 ) .",
      "The fourth edition of The Dark Eye supports a great variety of character choices . Where the older editions forced the player to create a character along very strict lines , the fourth edition is flexible and the player can choose from hundreds of different character classes and cultural backgrounds . The creation rules are somewhat similar to those of Shadowrun ( also published by Fantasy Productions ) and even more to GURPS . One reason for this development is the large community of professional authors and enthusiastic players , which have helped to define the continent of Aventuria over the last 20 years . Character generation is based on \u201cgeneration points\u201d from which a race , a culture and a profession must be \u201cpaid\u201d . The points are also used for attributes and other skills . After generation , the gained \u201cadventure points\u201d for each adventure can be used for equipping the character with skills . Consequently , the systems intends to balance power levels of different character classes .",
      "The fourth edition was also translated into English . Three books are available in English ( all published 2006 ) :",
      "- Basic Rules ( )",
      "- Secret of the Blue Tower / Witching Hour ( )",
      "- World of Aventuria ( )",
      "Fifth edition ( 2015 ) .",
      "Ulisses started development of the fifth edition in the beginning of 2014 . Its development involved a players poll and parts of the publishers internet forum are dedicated to that topic . The beta version ( in German ) was released 10 May 2014 and can be freely downloaded . The final German version is available as of 31 July 2015 . The publisher also created a website concerning the progress of the English version . The English translation was released in November 2016 .",
      "Setting .",
      "Aventuria .",
      "The Dark Eye is set in the fantasy realm of Aventuria . During the 1990s , it was first translated as Arkania , but the name was later changed to one closer to the original German name . Aventuria is a continent of the planet Ethra ( an anagram of Earth , as the planets name in the German edition , Dere , is an anagram of , the German word for Earth ) . The other continents of Ethra are Myranor ( also called Gyldenland in Aventuria ) , Uthuria and Vaestenland .",
      "Tharun .",
      "Tharun was envisioned as the inner side of Ethra , which was supposed to be a hollow world . It is lit by a central sun which also annihilates the usual magic . In todays ingame theory Tharun is a so-called Globule , a place in another Sphere of reality \u2013 or an alternate dimension ( although this explanation is very simplified ) .",
      "The original sun , Glost , was the work of Guerimm , the god of fire . New gods appeared and started to oppose the twelve gods of Aventuria . One of them , ArkanZim , destroyed Glost , and another new god , Sindayri , created a new sun , aiming to reduce the influence of the twelve gods in the hollow world . The splinters of Glost were spread everywhere . The inhabitants picked them and drew runes on them . They thus became runestones ; the combination of three runestones can lead to the liberation of the energy of Glost , allowing a new magic . Tharun is linked to the surface of Ethra by a double-sided volcano . The upper side is on an island 1,400 km west from Havena , the other side is upside down , and is situated in Tharun on the isle of Hamur . The society is a military dictatorship , with a caste of Sword Masters ruling the rest of the population .",
      "Myranor .",
      "Myranor or Gyldenland ( In the original , meaning Golden country ) is a large continent west of Aventuria . It was first described in 1990 and released as a separate RPG in 2000 . Initially , it was used to play-test an early version of what came to be The Dark Eye 4th edition rules .",
      "In contrast to Aventuria , the setting is high fantasy . There are gigantic Metropolis , flying ships and cities , several races unknown to aventurians including cat-like humanoids and intelligent insects , as well as a country leached by its vampire-like , skull god Draydal\u0101n worshiping population . The continent is huge and parts of it still are unexplored . While most of Aventuria is set in the central European Middle Ages , Myranor is based on a mixture of classic Greek/Roman as well as medieval Asian background . One notable political structure is a huge empire that has been in degeneration for millennia . At its height , it had been the origin of modern civilization in Aventuria , and the area it still controls is larger than Aventuria itself . In its early years , the empire was controlled by mighty three-eyed wizards called the old ones , who disappeared thousands of years ago .",
      "After its initial release in 2000 , only one additional rule book , one regional description and six adventures were released . After those , nothing further was released for Myranor . Two fans , however , revised Myranor to be played with the final 4th edition rules with FanPros permission . These new rules were released as a hardcover book in January 2006 . On 20 January 2007 Ulisses Spiele announced that they would be handling future publications related to Myranor .",

      "Sir James Robert Dickson , ( 30 November 183210 January 1901 ) was an Australian politician and businessman , the 13th Premier of Queensland and a member of the first federal ministry .",
      "Early life .",
      "Dickson was born on 30 November 1832 in Plymouth , Devon , England . He was the only son of Mary Maria ( n\u00e9e Palmer ) and James Dickson . He was educated in Scotland at the High School of Glasgow , and subsequently worked as a junior clerk at the City of Glasgow Bank . Dickson arrived in Australia in 1854 during the Victorian gold rush . He initially worked for the Bank of Australasia and then for Rae , Dickson & Co. , his cousins merchant firm . He moved to the Colony of Queensland in 1862 , working for an estate agent for a period and then establishing himself as an auctioneer and land agent . He built Toorak House , a villa overlooking the Brisbane River .",
      "Colonial politics .",
      "Dickson was elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Enoggera in 1873 . He was made Secretary for Public Works and Mines in 1876 under Arthur Macalister , and was Treasurer 1876\u201379 . In the absence of Sir Samuel Griffith he was briefly Opposition Leader , and was Treasurer again 1883\u201387 after Griffith became Premier . He lost his seat in 1888 but was again elected for Bulimba in 1892 , supporting the importation of labourers from the South Pacific to work on the Queensland canefields .",
      "In the so-called Continuous Ministry of the late 1890s , Dickson attained the positions of Secretary for Railways in 1897 , Postmaster-General and Home Secretary 1898\u201399 . In September 1898 , after the death of Thomas Byrnes he was made Premier . The Continuous Ministry by this stage was falling apart , and Dickson had only a brief period in office before Anderson Dawson gained the support of the Legislative Assembly to become the leader of the worlds first Labour Party government . The Ministerialists regrouped a week later to vote Dawson out of office . Dickson lacked support to become Premier again , and that position instead went to Robert Philp , in whose government Dickson was Chief Secretary .",
      "Federal politics and death .",
      "Dickson was a leading supporter of federation in Queensland and was mainly responsible for winning a yes vote in the Queensland referendum on the proposed Constitution of Australia in 1900 . As a result , Dickson was appointed Minister for Defence in the first federal ministry under Edmund Barton on 1 January 1901 . He was intending to stand for election to the first Federal Parliament , but on 10 January he died after being taken ill at the Commonwealths inaugural ceremonies in Sydney on 1 January . He was the first federal Minister to die in office .",
      "He was accorded a state funeral ; it proceeded from Toorak , his residence at Hamilton , to the All Saints Anglican Church . After a short service it moved on to the Nundah Cemetery .",
      "Honours .",
      "He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in November 1891 . Only nine days before he died , Dickson was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the New Years Honours List 1 January 1901 , in recognition of services in connection with the Federation of Australian Colonies and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia . The federal electoral division of Dickson in Queensland , and the Canberra suburb of Dickson are named after him ."

He was born in 1903 in Cz\u0119stochowa , Poland ( then part of the Russian Empire ) to a Jewish family .",
      "Imich , a supercentenarian , also became the oldest living man at age 111 after the death of almost 112-year-old Arturo Licata , of Italy , on April 24 , 2014 . Until his own death a little more than a month later , at the age of 111 years and 124 days , Imich was certified by Guinness World Records as the worlds oldest living man .",
      "Imich was also the last surviving veteran of the Polish-Soviet War .",
      "Early war service .",
      "Imich stated that , at age 15 , he and the rest of his class joined the Polish forces to fight the Bolsheviks in 1918 . His older brother reportedly served as an instructor in the automobile division , so Imich learned to drive trucks for the army until the Bolshevik forces were pushed back and Imich returned to school .",
      "Academic career .",
      "He earned a PhD in zoology at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w in 1929 , but as he could not find an academic position in zoology , he switched to chemistry . During the 1920s and 1930s he did some research on a medium , Matylda , for the Polish Society for Psychical Research . He published a report in 1932 in a German journal called Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Parapsychologie , but all of the unpublished notes and photos from the research were lost during World War II .",
      "Alexander Imich was already mentioned in a couple of English-language psychist books and journals as early as 1933 and 1934 .",
      "World War II .",
      "During World War II , Imich and his wife Wela ( pronounced Vela ) fled to Soviet-occupied Bia\u0142ystok , where he was employed as a chemist . The couple were later interned in a labor camp for the duration of the war due to their refusal to accept Soviet citizenship . They were eventually freed and chose to emigrate to the U.S . in 1951 , as almost all of their Polish relatives and friends were murdered in the Holocaust .",
      "Life in the United States .",
      "In 1952 , Imich and Wela ( who died in 1986 ) emigrated to the United States , first to Pennsylvania and then to New York , dividing their time between both places . To make a living , Imich initially took up chemistry , but once Wela made a career for herself as a psychologist in 1965 , he turned to parapsychology . After becoming a widower , he continued his lifelong interest in parapsychology , giving out the Imich prize for parapsychology research for several years until he began experiencing financial problems .",
      "Imich wrote numerous papers for journals in the field and edited a book , Incredible Tales of the Paranormal , which was published by Bramble Books in 1995 . He formed the Anomalous Phenomena Research Center in 1999 , trying to find a way to produce The Crucial Demonstration , the goal of which is to demonstrate the reality of paranormal phenomena to mainstream scientists and the general public . In 2012 , he began to transfer the records of his research into the paranormal to the University of Manitoba Department of Archives and Special Collections .",
      "Imich suffered a fall either on or shortly before his 111th birthday\u2014with him spending his 111th birthday in the New York Citys Roosevelt Hospital . After his release from Roosevelt Hospital , Imich belatedly celebrated his 111th birthday either in late April or early May 2014 .",
      "After being the worlds oldest living man for around 1.5 months , Alexander Imich died on June 8 , 2014 , at 9:03 AM from natural causes at the age of 111 . He was succeeded as the worlds oldest man by Sakari Momoi of Japan ( who was born on February 5 , 1903 , just one day after Imich ) ."

      "Early life and family .",
      "Born near Doncaster , Yorkshire , Sanderson was the son of Thomas Anderson of Armthorpe and Sarah n\u00e9e Cromack , daughter of John Cromack . In 1833 , he married Charlotte Matilda Manners-Sutton , daughter of Charles Manners-Sutton , 1st Viscount Canterbury , and they had at least 10 children \u2014 six sons , and four daughters , including :",

      "- Matilda Amy Frances Sanderson ( c1852-1931 )",
      "Business career .",
      "Early in his adult life , Sanderson became a clerk in London bill-broking firm Richardson , Overend , and Company , where the quaker Samuel Gurney was a partner\u2014which some historians suggest means Sanderson may also have a quaker upbringing . By 1827 , Sanderson was operating as a bill broker but at his own business , dominating the London market in the later years of that decade alongside Gurneys business , then renamed Overend , Gurney and Company\u2014both at Lombard Street in London .",
      "In 1837 , Sanderson moved his business to King William Street , London ; in 1847 , that business then had to suspend payment , before being able to trade again in early 1848 .",
      "Just two weeks after his death in 1857 , the business\u2014then known as Sanderson , Sandeman and Company\u2014failed with debts of \u00a35,299,006 .",
      "Member of parliament .",
      "Sanderson first became Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Colchester at a by-election in 1829\u2014held due to the resignation of Sir George Smyth , 6th Baronet . Having cultivated anti-Catholic and Tory relationships , he was put forward by the Colchester corporation to replace Smyth , a fellow Tory . A token challenge was put forward to counter Sandersons bid for the seat , but he won the seat , declaring a desire to promote the education of the poor and to put an end to the traffic in human blood .",
      "Having taken his seat on 28 April 1829 , one of his first votes was to block the Radical ( MP ) Daniel OConnell from taking his seat in the House of Commons at Clare without taking the Oath of Supremacy . At a dinner in July of the same year , he lamented that nothing of great importance had taken place in the House , but he was prepared to stand forward in support of those principles which he had publicly avowed .",
      "In 1830 , he voted with the government against transferring the electorate of East Retford into the soon-to-be-created constituency of Birmingham ; against enfranchising Birmingham , Leeds and Manchester ; and against Lord Blandfords parliamentary reform scheme . Despite this , he is not recorded as having spoken during this period , although he petitioned for the abolition of the death penalty for forgery , then voting in that manner in June 1830 .",
      "As the 1830 general election approached , Sanderson sought to retain the seat but was forced to pull out at a late stage when his agent was spotted in an act of bribery . At the general election a year later , he again sought to represent the seat , gaining corporation backing , in a bid to prevent the return of reformers . Yet his canvassing was received poorly , with an angry mob forcing his carriage into a pond . Nevertheless , he attended the hustings , promising to accept the necessity of parliamentary reform , an extension of the franchise to large and populous places , but still rejected the need to disenfranchise other seats . Regardless , Sanderson polled third and was not elected .",
      "However , Sanderson returned to the seat a year later , at the 1832 general election , securing the most votes , and held it for another 15 years until 1847 , when he was ranked third in the poll , losing the election . Within this period , he opposed the Maynooth Grant and repealing the Corn Laws , and married the Commons Speakers daughter .",
      "Death .",
      "Sanderson died in 1857 at Hazlewood in Hertfordshire leaving , via his will , \u00a33,000 to his wife , Charlotte , and dividing the rest of his property among his children ."

      "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid",
      "Club Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid , S.A.D . ( ; meaning Athletic Club of Madrid ) , commonly referred to as Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in English or simply as Atl\u00e9tico or Atleti , is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid , that play in La Liga . The club play their home games at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium , which has a capacity of 68,456 .",
      "In terms of league titles won , Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are the third most successful club in Spanish football \u2013 behind Real Madrid and Barcelona . Atl\u00e9tico have won La Liga on eleven occasions , including a league and cup double in 1996 ; the Copa del Rey on ten occasions ; two Supercopas de Espa\u00f1a , one",
      "Atl\u00e9ticos home kit is red and white vertical striped shirts , blue shorts , and blue and red socks . This combination has been used since 1911 . Throughout their history the club has been known by a number of nicknames , including Los Colchoneros ( The Mattress Makers ) , due to their first team stripes being the same colours as traditional mattresses . During the 1970s , they became known as Los Indios , which some attribute to the clubs signing several South American players after the restrictions on signing foreign players were lifted . However , there are a number of alternative theories which claim they were named so because their stadium was camped on the river bank , or because Los Indios ( The Indians ) were the traditional enemy of Los Blancos ( The Whites ) , which is the nickname of the clubs city rivals , Real Madrid . Felipe VI , the king of Spain , has been the honorary president of the club since 2003 .",
      "The club co-owned the Indian Super League ( ISL ) franchise in Kolkata , formerly named Atl\u00e9tico de Kolkata , which won the competition twice , but in 2017 Atl\u00e9tico decided to end its franchise partnership with the ISL club due to broken commitments . Atl\u00e9tico also co-owns Liga MX club Atl\u00e9tico San Luis , and the Canadian Premier League side Atl\u00e9tico Ottawa .",
      "History .",
      "Foundation and first years ( 1903\u20131939 ) .",
      "The club was founded on 26 April 1903 as Athletic Club Sucursal de Madrid by three Basque students living in Madrid . These founders saw the new club as a youth branch of their childhood team , Athletic Bilbao who they had just seen win the 1903 Copa del Rey Final in the city . In 1904 , they were joined by dissident members of Real Madrid . The side began playing in blue and white halved shirts , the then colours of Athletic Bilbao , but by 1911 , both the Bilbao and Madrid teams were playing in their current colours of red and white stripes . Some believe the change came about because red and white striped tops were the cheapest to make , as the same combination was used to make ticking for mattresses , and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts . This contributed to the clubs nickname , Los Colchoneros .",
      "However , another explanation is that both Athletic Bilbao and Athletic Madrid used to buy Blackburn Rovers blue and white kits in England . In late 1909 , Juanito Elorduy , a former player and member of the board of Athletic Madrid , went to England to buy kits for both teams but failed to find Blackburn kits to purchase ; he instead bought the red and white shirts of Southampton ( the club from the port city which was his embarkation point back to Spain ) . Athletic Madrid adopted the red and white shirt , leading to them being known as Los Rojiblancos , but opted to keep their existing blue shorts whereas the Bilbao team switched to new black shorts . Athletic Bilbao won the 1911 Copa del Rey Final using several borrowed players from Athletic Madrid , including who scored one of their goals .",
      "Athletics first ground , the Ronda de Vallecas , was in the eponymous working-class area on the south side of the city . In 1919 , the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Urbanizadora Metropolitana\u2014the company that ran the underground communication system in Madrid\u2014acquired some land , near the Ciudad Universitaria . In 1921 , Athletic Madrid became independent of parent-club Athletic Bilbao and moved into a 35,800-seater stadium built by the company , the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid . The Metropolitano was used until 1966 , when they moved to the new Estadio Vicente Calder\u00f3n . After the move , the Metropolitano was demolished and was replaced with university buildings and an office block belonging to the company ENUSA .",
      "During the 1920s , Athletic won the Campeonato del Centro three times and were Copa del Rey runners-up in 1921 , where they faced parent club Athletic Bilbao , as they would again in 1926 . Based on these successes , in 1928 they were invited to join the Primera Divisi\u00f3n of the inaugural La Liga played the following year . During their debut La Liga campaign , the club were managed by Fred Pentland , but after two seasons they were relegated to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n . They briefly returned to La Liga in 1934 but were relegated again in 1936 after Josep Samitier took over in mid-season from Pentland . The Spanish Civil War gave Los Colchoneros a reprieve , as Real Oviedo was unable to play due to the destruction of their stadium during the bombings . Thus , both La Liga and Athletics relegation were postponed , the latter by winning a playoff against Osasuna , champion of the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n tournament .",
      "Athletic Aviaci\u00f3n de Madrid ( 1939\u20131947 ) .",
      "By 1939 , when La Liga had resumed , Athletic had merged with Aviaci\u00f3n Nacional of Zaragoza to become Athletic Aviaci\u00f3n de Madrid . Aviaci\u00f3n Nacional had been founded in 1939 by members of the Spanish Air Force . They had been promised a place in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n for the 1939\u201340 season , only to be denied by the RFEF . As a compromise , this club merged with Athletic , whose squad had lost eight players during the Civil War . The team were awarded a place in the 1939\u201340 La Liga campaign only as a replacement for Real Oviedo . With the legendary Ricardo Zamora as manager , the club subsequently won their first La Liga title that season and retained the title in 1941 . The most influential and charismatic player of these years was the captain Germ\u00e1n G\u00f3mez , who was signed from Racing de Santander in 1939 . He played eight consecutive seasons for the Rojiblancos until the 1947\u201348 campaign . From his central midfield position , he formed a legendary midfield alongside Mach\u00edn and Ram\u00f3n Gabilondo .",
      "In 1941 , a decree issued by Francisco Franco banned teams from using foreign names and the club became Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n de Madrid . In 1947 , the club decided to drop the military association from its name and settled on its current name of Club Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid . The same year saw Atl\u00e9tico beat Real Madrid 5\u20130 at the Metropolitano , their biggest win over their cross-town rivals to date .",
      "Golden age ( 1947\u20131965 ) .",
      "Under Helenio Herrera and with the help of Larbi Benbarek , Atl\u00e9tico won La Liga again in 1950 and 1951 . With the departure of Herrera in 1953 , the club began to slip behind Real Madrid and Barcelona and for the remainder of the 1950s were left to battle it out with Athletic Bilbao for the title of third team in Spain .",
      "However , during the 1960s and 1970s , Atl\u00e9tico Madrid seriously challenged Barcelona for the position of second team . The 1957\u201358 season saw Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk take charge of Atl\u00e9tico , where he led them to second place in La Liga . This resulted in Atl\u00e9tico qualifying for the 1958\u201359 European Cup since the winners , Real Madrid , were the reigning European champions . Inspired by Brazilian centre-forward Vav\u00e1 and Enrique Collar , Atl\u00e9tico reached the semi-finals after beating Drumcondra , CSKA Sofia and Schalke 04 . In the semi-finals , they met Real Madrid , who won the first leg 2\u20131 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u while Atl\u00e9tico won 1\u20130 at the Metropolitano . The tie went to a replay and Real won 2\u20131 in Zaragoza .",
      "Atl\u00e9tico , however , gained their revenge when , led by former Real coach Jos\u00e9 Villalonga , they defeated Real in two successive Copa del Rey finals in 1960 and 1961 . In 1962 , they won the European Cup Winners Cup , beating Fiorentina 3\u20130 after a replay . This achievement was significant for the club , as the Cup Winners Cup was the only major European trophy that Real Madrid never won . The following year the club reached the 1963 final , but lost to English side Tottenham Hotspur 5\u20131 . Enrique Collar , who continued to be an influential player during this era , was now joined by the likes of midfielder Miguel Jones and midfield playmaker Adelardo .",
      "Atl\u00e9ticos best years coincided with dominant Real Madrid teams . Between 1961 and 1980 , Real Madrid dominated La Liga , winning the competition 14 times . During this era , only Atl\u00e9tico offered Real any serious challenge , winning La Liga titles in 1966 , 1970 , 1973 and 1977 and finishing runners-up in 1961 , 1963 and 1965 . The club had further success winning the Copa del Rey on three occasions in 1965 , 1972 and 1976 . In 1965 , when they finished as La Liga runners-up to Real after an intense battle for the title , Atl\u00e9tico became the first team to beat Real at the Bernab\u00e9u in eight years .",
      "European Cup Finalists ( 1965\u20131974 ) .",
      "Significant players from this era included the now-veteran Adelardo and regular goalscorers Luis Aragon\u00e9s , Javier Irureta and Jos\u00e9 Eulogio G\u00e1rate , the latter winning the Pichichi three times in 1969 , 1970 and 1971 . In the 1970s , Atl\u00e9tico also recruited several Argentine players , signing Rub\u00e9n Ayala , Panadero D\u00edaz and Ram\u00f3n Cacho Heredia as well as coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo . Lorenzo believed in discipline , caution and disrupting the opponents game , and although controversial , his methods proved successful\u2014after winning La Liga in 1973 , the club reached the 1974 European Cup Final . On the way to the Final , Atl\u00e9tico knocked out Galatasaray , Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti , Red Star Belgrade and Celtic . In the away leg of the semi-final against Celtic , Atl\u00e9tico had Ayala , D\u00edaz and substitute Quique all sent off during a hard-fought encounter in what was reported as one of the worst cases of cynical fouling the tournament has seen . Because of this cynicism , they managed a 0\u20130 draw , which was followed by a 2\u20130 victory in the return leg with goals from G\u00e1rate and Adelardo . The Final at Heysel Stadium , however , was a loss for Atl\u00e9tico . Against a Bayern Munich team that included Franz Beckenbauer , Sepp Maier , Paul Breitner , Uli Hoene\u00df and Gerd M\u00fcller , Atl\u00e9tico played above themselves . Despite missing Ayala , D\u00edaz and Quique through suspension , they went ahead in extra-time with only seven minutes left . Aragon\u00e9s scored with a superb , curling free-kick that looked like the winner , but in the last minute of the game , Bayern defender Georg Schwarzenbeck equalized with a stunning 25-yarder that left Atl\u00e9tico goalkeeper Miguel Reina motionless . In a replay back at Heysel two days later , Bayern won convincingly 4\u20130 , with two goals each from Hoene\u00df and M\u00fcller .",
      "The Aragon\u00e9s years ( 1974\u20131987 ) .",
      "Shortly after the defeat in the 1974 European Cup Final , Atl\u00e9tico appointed their veteran player Luis Aragon\u00e9s as coach . Aragon\u00e9s subsequently served as coach on four separate occasions , from 1974 to 1980 , from 1982 to 1987 , once again from 1991 until 1993 and finally from 2002 to 2003 . His first success came quickly as Bayern Munich had refused to participate in the Intercontinental Cup because of fixture congestion , and as European Cup runners-up , Atl\u00e9tico were invited instead . Their opponents were Independiente of Argentina and , after losing the away leg 1\u20130 , they won the return leg 2\u20130 with goals from Javier Irureta and Rub\u00e9n Ayala . Aragon\u00e9s subsequently led the club to further successes in the Copa del Rey in 1976 and La Liga in 1977 .",
      "During his second spell in charge , Aragon\u00e9s led the club to a runners-up finish in La Liga and a winners medal in the Copa del Rey , both in 1985 . He received considerable help from Hugo S\u00e1nchez , who scored 19 league goals and won the Pichichi . S\u00e1nchez also scored twice in the cup final as Atl\u00e9tico beat Athletic Bilbao 2\u20131 . S\u00e1nchez , however , only remained at the club for one season before his move across the city to Real Madrid . Despite the loss of S\u00e1nchez , Aragon\u00e9s went on to lead the club to success in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a in 1985 and then guided them to the European Cup Winners Cup final in 1986 . Atl\u00e9tico , however , lost their third successive European final , this time 3\u20130 to Dynamo Kyiv .",
      "The Radomir Anti\u0107 years ( 1987\u20132005 ) .",
      "In 1987 , controversial politician and businessman Jes\u00fas Gil became club president , running the club until his resignation in May 2003 .",
      "Atl\u00e9tico had not won La Liga for 10 years and were desperate for league success . Right away , Gil spent heavily , bringing in a number of expensive signings , most notably Portuguese winger Paulo Futre , who had just won the European Cup with Porto . All the spending , however , only brought in two consecutive Copa del Rey trophies in 1991 and 1992 as the league title proved elusive . The closest Atl\u00e9tico came to the La Liga trophy was the 1990\u201391 season when they finished runners-up by 10 points to Johan Cruyffs Barcelona . In the process , Gil developed a ruthless reputation due to the manner in which he ran the club . In pursuit of league success , he hired and fired a number of high-profile head coaches , including C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti , Ron Atkinson , Javier Clemente , Tomislav Ivi\u0107 , Francisco Maturana , Alfio Basile as well as club legend Luis Aragon\u00e9s .",
      "Jes\u00fas Gil also closed down Atl\u00e9ticos youth academy in 1992 , a move that would prove significant due to 15-year-old academy member Ra\u00fal who , as a result , went across town to later achieve worldwide fame with rivals Real Madrid . The move came as part of the overall Gil-initiated business restructuring of the club ; Atl\u00e9tico became a Sociedad An\u00f3nima Deportiva , a corporate structure benefiting from a then-recently introduced special legal status under Spanish corporate law , allowing individuals to purchase and trade club shares .",
      "In the 1994\u201395 league campaign , Atl\u00e9tico only avoided relegation via a draw on the last day of the season . This prompted another managerial change along with a wholesale squad clearance during the summer 1995 transfer window . Somewhat unexpectedly , in the following 1995\u201396 season , newly arrived head coach Radomir Anti\u0107 , with a squad including holdovers Toni , Roberto Soloz\u00e1bal , Delf\u00ed Geli , Juan Vizca\u00edno , Jos\u00e9 Luis Caminero , Diego Simeone and Kiko , as well as new acquisitions Milinko Panti\u0107 , Luboslav Penev , Santi Denia and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Molina finally delivered the much sought-after league title as Atl\u00e9tico won the La Liga/Copa del Rey double .",
      "The next season , 1996\u201397 , saw the club take part in the UEFA Champions League for the first time . With expectations and ambitions raised , the most notable summer transfer signings were striker Juan Esn\u00e1ider from Real Madrid and Radek Bejbl , who was coming off a great showing for Czech Republic at Euro 1996 . Playing on two fronts , Atl\u00e9tico fell out of the league title contention early while , in the Champions League , they were eliminated by Ajax in extra-time in the quarter-finals . Before the 1997\u201398 season , the heavy spending continued with the signings of Christian Vieri and Juninho . All of the success , however , produced little change in the overall Gil strategy , and although Anti\u0107 survived three consecutive seasons in charge , he was replaced during the summer of 1998 with Arrigo Sacchi , who himself only remained in the managerial hot seat for less than six months . Anti\u0107 then returned briefly in early 1999 only to be replaced with Claudio Ranieri at the end of the season . The 1999\u20132000 season proved disastrous for Atl\u00e9tico . In December 1999 , Gil and his board were suspended pending an investigation into the misuse of club funds , with government-appointed administrator Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rub\u00ed running Atl\u00e9ticos day-to-day operations . With the removal of club President Jes\u00fas Gil and his board , the players performed poorly and the club floundered . Ranieri handed in his resignation with the club sitting 17th out of 20 in the league table and heading towards relegation . Anti\u0107 , returning for his third coaching stint , was unable to prevent the inevitable . Despite reaching the Copa del Rey final in 2000 , Atl\u00e9tico were relegated .",
      "Atl\u00e9tico spent two seasons in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n , narrowly missing out on promotion in 2000\u201301 season before winning the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n championship in 2002 . It was again Luis Aragon\u00e9s , in his fourth and last spell as manager of Atl\u00e9tico , who brought them back to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n . He also coached the team during the next season , and gave Fernando Torres his La Liga debut .",
      "Aguirre era ( 2006\u20132009 ) .",
      "In 2006 , Atl\u00e9tico signed Portuguese midfielders Costinha and Maniche , as well as Argentine forward Sergio Ag\u00fcero . In July 2007 , Fernando Torres left the club for Liverpool for \u20ac38 million , while Luis Garc\u00eda moved in the opposite direction at the same time in an unrelated transfer . The club also bought Uruguay international and former European Golden Boot and Pichichi winner Diego Forl\u00e1n for roughly \u20ac21 million from Villarreal . Other additions included Portuguese winger Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa from Benfica for \u20ac20 million and winger Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes from Arsenal for \u20ac12 million .",
      "In July 2007 , the Atl\u00e9tico board reached an agreement with the City of Madrid to sell the land where their stadium is located and move the club to the City-owned Olympic Stadium . However , the new stadium will change hands in 2016 and be owned by the club . Madrid had applied to host the 2016 Olympic Games , losing out to Rio de Janeiro .",
      "The 2007\u201308 season proved to be the most successful season for the club in the past decade . The team reached the round of 32 in the UEFA Cup , where they were defeated by Bolton Wanderers . They also reached the quarter-final round of the Copa del Rey , where they were beaten by eventual champions Valencia . More significantly , the team finished the league season in fourth place , qualifying for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the 1996\u201397 season .",
      "On 3 February 2009 , Javier Aguirre was dismissed from his post as manager after a poor start to the season , going without a win in six games . He later claimed that this was not accurate , and that he had left by mutual termination rather than through sacking . There was public outrage after his dismissal , many believing he was not the cause of Atl\u00e9ticos problems , namely player Diego Forl\u00e1n . He backed his former manager and said that , Dismissing Javier was the easy way out , but he was not the cause of our problems . The players are to blame because we have not been playing well and we have been committing a lot of errors . This led to the appointment of Abel Resino as Atl\u00e9ticos new manager .",
      "Atl\u00e9ticos success continued in the latter half of the season when they placed fourth once again in the league table , securing a position in the playoff round of the UEFA Champions League . Striker Diego Forl\u00e1n was crowned with the Pichichi and also won the European Golden Shoe after scoring 32 goals for Atl\u00e9tico that season . Atl\u00e9tico saw this domestic success as an opportunity to reinforce their squad for the upcoming Champions League season . They replaced veteran goalkeeper Leo Franco with David de Gea from the youth ranks and signed promising youngster Sergio Asenjo from Real Valladolid . Atl\u00e9tico also purchased Real Betis defender and Spanish international Juanito on a free transfer . Despite pressure from big clubs to sell star players Ag\u00fcero and Forl\u00e1n , Atl\u00e9tico remained committed to keeping their strong attacking base in the hopes for a successful new season .",
      "The 2009\u201310 season , however , began poorly with many defeats and goals conceded . On 21 October , Atletico were hammered 4\u20130 by English club Chelsea in the Champions League group stage . This defeat led Atleticos management to announce that manager Abel Resino had to leave . After failing to sign Danish former footballer Michael Laudrup , Atl\u00e9tico Madrid made it official that the new manager for the rest of the season would be former player Quique .",
      "La Liga and European successes ( 2009\u2013 ) .",
      "With the arrival of Quique as coach in October 2009 , Atl\u00e9tico saw a huge change of fortunes . Though they continued to lag somewhat in La Liga during the 2009\u201310 season , finishing in the ninth position , they managed to get third place in the 2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League group stage and subsequently entered the Europa League in the round of 32 , going on to win the Europa League , beating English teams Liverpool in the semi-finals and eventually Fulham in the final held in the HSH Nordbank Arena in Hamburg on 12 May 2010 . Diego Forl\u00e1n scored twice , the second being an extra-time winner in the 116th minute , as Atl\u00e9tico Madrid won 2\u20131 .",
      "It was the first time since the 1961\u201362 European Cup Winners Cup that Atl\u00e9tico had claimed a European title . They also reached the Copa del Rey final on 19 May 2010 , where they faced Sevilla , but lost 2\u20130 at the Camp Nou in Barcelona . By winning the Europa League , they qualified for the 2010 UEFA Super Cup against Inter Milan , winner of the 2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League , which was played at Stade Louis II in Monaco on 27 August 2010 . Atl\u00e9tico won 2\u20130 with goals from Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes and Sergio Ag\u00fcero , Atl\u00e9ticos first win in the UEFA Super Cup .",
      "Atl\u00e9tico had a comparatively disappointing 2010\u201311 season , finishing only seventh in the League and being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey and the group stage of the Europa League . This ultimately led to the departure of manager Quique before the conclusion of the season , who was replaced with ex-Sevilla manager Gregorio Manzano , and who secured the final Europa League place for Atl\u00e9tico . Manzano himself was replaced with Diego Simeone in December 2011 after a poor run of form in La Liga .",
      "Simeone led Atl\u00e9tico to their second Europa League win in the three years since its creation , as they beat Athletic Bilbao 3\u20130 in the final on 9 May 2012 at National Arena in Bucharest with Radamel Falcao \u2013 twice \u2013 and Diego being the scorers . Again , by winning the Europa League , they qualified for the 2012 UEFA Super Cup against Chelsea , winner of the previous seasons Champions League , which was played at Stade Louis II , Monaco on 31 August 2012 ; Atl\u00e9tico won 4\u20131 , including a hat-trick by Falcao in the first half . On 17 May 2013 , Atl\u00e9tico beat Real Madrid 2\u20131 in the Copa del Rey Final in a tense match where both teams finished with 10 men . This ended a 14-year and 25-match winless streak in the Madrid derby . The 2012\u201313 season saw the club finish with three trophies in a little over a year .",
      "On 17 May 2014 , a 1\u20131 draw at the Camp Nou against Barcelona secured the La Liga title for Atl\u00e9tico , their first since 1996 , and the first title since 2003\u201304 not won by Barcelona or Real Madrid . One week later , Atl\u00e9tico faced city rivals Real Madrid in their first Champions League final since 1974 , and the first played between two sides from the same city . They took a first-half lead through Diego God\u00edn and led until the third minute of injury time , when Sergio Ramos headed in an equaliser from a corner ; the match went to extra time , and Real ultimately won 4\u20131 . Atl\u00e9tico reached a second Champions League final in three seasons in 2015\u201316 , again facing Real Madrid , and lost on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw . In 2018 , they won their third Europa League title in nine years by beating Marseille 3\u20130 in the final at Stade de Lyon in Lyon , courtesy of a brace from Antoine Griezmann and a goal from club captain Gabi in what would be his last match for the club . Atl\u00e9tico also won another UEFA Super Cup after beating Real Madrid 4\u20132 at the outset of the following season at the Lillek\u00fcla Arena in Tallinn . On 22 May 2021 , a 1\u20132 win at the Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla Stadium against Valladolid secured the La Liga title for Atl\u00e9tico , seven years after their last triumph .",
      "Rivalries .",
      "Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are clubs with contrasting identities and different fates . While Real Madrids Santiago Bernab\u00e9u proudly rises on Paseo de la Castellana in the wealthy Chamart\u00edn neighbourhood of northern Madrid , Atl\u00e9ticos former stadium , the less glamorous Vicente Calder\u00f3n , stood in the central-south of Madrid 1.8 km from the city center in the working class barrio of Arganzuela . Historically , Real Madrid have long been seen as the establishment club . On the other side , Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were always characterized by a sentimiento de rebeld\u00eda , a sense of rebellion , although during the early Francisco Franco years , it was Atl\u00e9tico that was the preferred team of the regime . They were associated with the military airforce ( renamed Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n ) , until the regimes preferences moved towards Real Madrid in the 1950s .",
      "Certainly , the dictatorial state sought to make political capital out of Real Madrids European Cup trophies at a time when Spain was internationally isolated ; Real Madrid are the best embassy we ever had , said Francos foreign minister Fernando Maria de Castiella . Such perceptions have had an important impact on the citys footballing identities , tapping into the collective consciousness . In this vein , Atl\u00e9tico fans were probably the originators , and are the most frequent singers , of the song , sung to the tune of the Real Madrid anthem , Hala Madrid , hala Madrid , el equipo del gobierno , la verg\u00fcenza del pa\u00eds , Go Madrid , go Madrid , the governments team , the countrys shame .",
      "Until recently , Atl\u00e9tico Madrid had struggled significantly in the derby , carrying a 14-year winless streak into the 2012\u201313 season . This spell ended , however , on 17 May 2013 after Atl\u00e9tico beat their city rivals 2\u20131 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in the 2013 Copa del Rey Final , and continued on 29 September 2013 when they won a 1\u20130 victory , again at the Bernab\u00e9u .",
      "More recently , a heated rivalry has emerged between Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Barcelona , which is also considered one of the Classics of Spanish football . This rivalry has become notorious in the late 2010s , marked by events such as the 2016 Champions League knockout phase where Atletico Madrid upset Barcelona , the controversial departure of French striker Antoine Griezmann from the Madrid club to the Catalan club in 2019 , and the surprise move of Luis Su\u00e1rez from Barcelona to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2020 , which saw the Uruguyan star play a crucial role in the teams championship run . However , by tradition and current affairs , the greatest rivalry is that which exists with its merengues neighbors . Furthermore , while Atletico Madrid and FC Barcelona are increasingly seen as rivals , fans of the clubs are noticeably more amicable towards each other than they are with Real Madrid .",

      "Atl\u00e9tico began playing in blue and white , mirroring then-parent club Athletic Bilbao , but both changed to red-and-white stripes by 1911 which became their traditional colours . The change took hold because red and white striped tops were the cheap to make , as the same combination was used to make bed mattresses , and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts . The kit has been made by Nike since 2001 , as the company wants to provide competition with rival brand Adidas , who have a long-term deal with Real Madrid .",
      "The clubs main shirt sponsorship by the government of Azerbaijan between 2012 and 2014 , featuring the slogan Land of Fire , was condemned by Reporters Without Borders , who satirized it in a campaign visual in which the shirts vertical stripes become prison bars with the logo Azerbaijan , Land of Repression . Atl\u00e9tico Madrid admitted its sponsorship deal had a political dimension , saying the intention was to promote the image of Azerbaijan . In August 2014 , the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights wrote to Atl\u00e9tico , calling on it to end the sponsorship by and promotion of Azerbaijan because of the countrys human rights record , calling it one of the most repressive countries in the world .",
      "Previously , the club was sponsored by Columbia Pictures , who would change the shirt sponsors logo , and occasionally the shirt itself , as they did with the away shirt when Spider-Man 2 was in cinemas . Because shirts would have to be introduced and removed from shops at a very fast pace to keep up with film releases , Nike decided to not include a sponsors logo on replica shirts made from 2002 to 2005 .",
      "- ( ** ) \u2013 2003\u201305 Columbia Pictures ( Movies advertised on the shirt included Bewitched , Hollywood Homicide , S.W.A.T. , Big Fish , Hellboy , Spanglish , , Hitch , xXx , and Spider-Man 2. )",

      "He was the son of Jes\u00fas Com\u00edn Sag\u00fc\u00e9s , an Aragonese prominent carlist figure . His family had been involved in the Carlist movement since the 19th century . He was raised in Barcelona . Without abandoning his catholic beliefs , he evolved toward communist positions . He married Mar\u00eda Llu\u00efsa Oliveres . In 1956 , he joined the Popular Liberation Front ( Spanish : Frente de Liberaci\u00f3n Popular , FLP , known colloquially as FELIPE ) , but abandoned it in 1962 to join the Workers Front of Catalonia ( Catalan language : Front Obrer de Catalunya , FOC ) , which was the Catalan referent of FELIPE . In 1970 , he joined the Organizaci\u00f3n Comunista de Espa\u00f1a ( Bandera Roja ) ( Communist Organization of Spain ( Red Flag ) , ( OCE-BR ) ) , but left it to found the Bandera Roja de Catalunya ( Red Flag of Catalonia ) in 1974 , which a little later joined the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia ( Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya , PSUC ) . In 1973 , he created the Christians for Socialism movement together with Joan N . Garc\u00eda-Nieto , and was one of its central figures . In 1980 , he was elected as a representative to the Parliament of Catalonia for the Province of Barcelona on behalf of the PSUC .",

      "British Rail Class 40",
      "The British Rail Class 40 is a type of British railway diesel electric locomotive . A total of 200 were built by English Electric between 1958 and 1962 . They were numbered D200-D399 . They were , for a time , the pride of British Rail\u2019s early diesel fleet . However , despite their initial success , by the time the last examples were entering service they were already being replaced on some top-level duties by more powerful locomotives . As they were slowly relegated from express passenger uses , the type found work on secondary passenger and freight services where they worked for many years . The final locomotives ended regular service in 1985 . The locomotives were commonly known as Whistlers because of the distinctive noise made by their turbochargers .",
      "Origins .",
      "The origins of the Class 40 fleet lay in the prototype diesel locomotives ( LMS No . 10000 and 10001 ordered by the London , Midland and Scottish Railway and British Railways and D16/2 ordered by British Railways between 1947 and 1954 ) and most notably with the Southern Region locomotive No . 10203 , which was powered by English Electrics 16SVT MkII engine developing 2,000 bhp ( 1,460 kW ) . The bogie design and power train of 10203 was used almost unchanged on the first ten production Class 40s .",
      "Prototypes .",
      "British Railways originally ordered ten Class 40s , then known as English Electric Type 4s , as evaluation prototypes . They were built at the Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows , Lancashire . The first locomotive , D200 , was delivered to Stratford on 14 March 1958 . Following fitter and crew training , D200 made its passenger d\u00e9but on an express train from London Liverpool Street to on 18 April 1958 . Five of the prototypes , Nos . D200 , D202-D205 , were trialled on similar services on the former Great Eastern routes , whilst the remaining five , Nos . D201 , D206-D209 , worked on Great Northern services on the East Coast Main Line .",
      "Sir Brian Robertson , then chairman of the British Transport Commission , was less than impressed , believing that the locomotives lacked the power to maintain heavy trains at high speed and were too expensive to run in multiple \u2013 opinions that were later proved to be correct . Airing his views at the regional boards prompted others to break cover and it was agreed that later orders would be uprated to 2500 hp ( a change that was never applied ) . Direct comparisons on the Great Eastern Main Line showed they offered little advantage over the Britannia class steam locomotives when driven well , and the Eastern Region declined to accept further machines as they deemed them unsuitable to replace the Pacific steam locomotives on the East Coast Main Line , preferring to hold on until the Deltic Class 55 diesels were delivered .",
      "The London Midland Region was only too pleased , as the Eastern Regions decision released additional locomotives to replace their ageing steam fleet . The West Coast Main Line had been starved of investment for many years and the poor track and generally lower speeds ( when compared to the East Coast route ) suited Class 40s , as the need to hold trains at speed for long periods simply did not exist and it better took advantage of their fairly rapid acceleration .",
      "Production .",
      "Following the mixed success of the prototypes , another 190 locomotives were ordered by British Railways , and were numbered from D210 to D399 . All were built at Vulcan Foundry , except one batch of twenty ( Nos . D305\u2013D324 ) which were built at Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns factory in Darlington . All the locomotives were painted in the British Railways diesel green livery , and the final locomotive , D399 , was delivered in September 1962 .",
      "Batches of the class were built with significant design differences , due to changes in railway working practices . The first 125 locomotives , Nos . D200\u2013D324 , were built with steam-age disc headcode markers , which were used to identify services . Later , it was decided that locomotives should display the four character train reporting number ( or headcode ) of the service they were hauling , and Nos . D325\u2013D344 were built with split headcode boxes , which displayed two characters either side of the locomotives central gangway doors . Another policy decision led to the discontinuing of the gangway doors ( which enabled train crew to move between two or three locomotives in multiple ) . The remaining locomotives , Nos . D345\u2013D399 , carried a central four-character headcode box . In 1965 , seven of the first batch of locomotives , Nos . D260\u2013D266 , which were based in Scotland , were converted to the central headcode design .",
      "From 1973 , locomotives were renumbered to suit the TOPS computer operating system , and became known as Class 40 . Locomotives D201 to D399 were renumbered in sequence into the range 40 001 to 40 199 . The first built locomotive , D200 , was renumbered 40 122 , which was vacant due to the scrapping of D322 as the result of accident damage .",
      "The named 40s .",
      "Locomotives in the range D210\u2013D235 were to be named after ships operated by the companies Cunard Line , Elder Dempster Lines , and Canadian Pacific Steamships , as they hauled express trains to Liverpool , the home port of these companies . The only locomotive not to carry a name was D226 which was to carry the name Media but never did so . From approximately 1970 , with Class 40s no longer working these trains , the nameplates were gradually removed , so that by 1973 contributors to Railway World were reporting 7 different locomotives running without nameplates , all observed in North Wales . However the Ian Allan Motive Power Combined Volume ( a list of all operational locomotives published annually for enthusiasts ) was stilll listing the names of all officially named Class 40 locomotives in 1980 despite none having carried their nameplates for many years .",
      "A series of unofficial names were applied to the Class 40s by enthusiasts and enthusiastic depot staff . Some locos ran in service with these names applied for many months , others were painted out within days .",
      "The locos to carry these unofficial names were :",
      "- 40 060 Ancient Mariner ( while in departmental duties as 97 405 )",
      "- 40 104 Warrior",
      "- 40 129 Dracula",
      "- 40 131 Spartan",
      "- 40 132 Hurricane",
      "- 40 134 Andromeda",
      "- 40 137 Trojan",
      "- 40 145 Panther",
      "- 40 150 Crewe",
      "- 40 155 Vulcan Empress",
      "- 40 164 Lismore",
      "BR service .",
      "The Class 40s operated in all areas of British Railways although sightings in the Western and Southern Regions have always been exceptionally rare and usually the result of special trains and/or unusual operational circumstances , but examples have been recorded such as D317 hauling a parcels train between Micheldever and Basingstoke on 3 July 1967 , and D335 operating the 07:35 Oxford to Paddington and 10:16 Paddington - Birmingham on 29 June 1971 . A review of the areas of operation published towards the end of the classs operational life showed no regular operational service on the Southern Region , and the only parts of the Western Region regularly visited were the Cambrian Line between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth , and freights on the Gloucester to Severn Tunnel Junction route .",
      "After the early trials the majority of Class 40s were based at depots in northern England , notably Longsight , Carlisle Kingmoor , and Wigan Springs Branch on the Midland Region , and Thornaby and Gateshead on the Eastern Region .",
      "The heyday of the class was in the early 1960s , when they hauled top-link expresses on the West Coast Main Line and in East Anglia . However , the arrival of more powerful diesels such as Class 47 , Class 50 , Class 55 , and the later InterCity 125 , together with the electrification of the West Coast Main Line , meant that the fleet was gradually relegated to more mundane duties .",
      "In later life the locomotives were mainly to be found hauling heavy freight and passenger trains in the north of England and Scotland . As more new rolling stock was introduced , their passenger work decreased , partly due to their lack of electric train heating ( D255 was fitted with electric train heating for a trial period in the mid-1960s ) for newer passenger coaches . They lost their last front-line passenger duties \u2013 in Scotland \u2013 in 1980 , and the last regular use on passenger trains was on the North Wales Coast Line between Holyhead , Crewe and Manchester , along with regular forays across the Pennines on Liverpool to York and Newcastle services .",
      "Throughout the early 1980s Class 40s were common performers on relief , day excursion ( adex ) and holidaymaker services along with deputisation duties for electric traction , especially on Sundays between Manchester and Birmingham . This resulted in visits to many distant parts of the network . It would be fair to say that few routes in the London Midland and Eastern regions did not see a Class 40 worked passenger service from time to time . Regular destinations included the seaside resorts of Scarborough , Skegness and Cleethorpes on the Eastern region , with Blackpool and Stranraer being regularly visited on the West Coast .",
      "Much rarer workings include visits to Londons Paddington and Euston stations , Norwich , Cardiff and even Kyle of Lochalsh . The fact that 40s could turn up almost anywhere resulted in them being followed by a hard core of bashers , enthusiasts dedicated to journeying over lines with rare traction for the route .",
      "Withdrawal .",
      "Withdrawal of the Class 40s started in 1976 , when three locomotives ( 40 005 , 40 039 and 40 102 ) were taken out of service . At over 130 tons the Class were by then considered underpowered . In addition , some were found to be suffering from fractures of the plate-frame bogies ( due mainly to inappropriate use on wagon-load freight and the associated running into tightly curved yards ) , and spares were also needed to keep other locomotives running .",
      "Also , many Class 40s were not fitted with air braking , leaving them unable to haul more modern freight and passenger vehicles . Despite this , only seventeen had been withdrawn by the start of the 1980s . The locomotives became more popular with railway enthusiasts as their numbers started to dwindle .",
      "Withdrawals then picked up apace , with the locomotives which lacked air brakes taking the brunt of the decline . In 1981 , all 130 remaining locomotives were concentrated in the London Midland region of BR . Classified works overhauls on the Class 40s were also gradually phased out , only 29 members of the class had a full classified in 1980 , and the final two emerged from Crewe Works in 1981 . The last to receive a classified overhaul was 40 167 in February 1981 .",
      "After that , numbers dwindled slowly until , by the end of 1984 , there were only sixteen still running . These included the pioneer locomotive , 40 122 , which , having been withdrawn in 1981 , was reinstated in July 1983 and painted in the original green livery to haul rail enthusiasts specials . The last passenger run by a Class 40 , apart from 40 122 , occurred on 27 January 1985 , when 40 012 hauled a train from Birmingham New Street to York . All the remaining locomotives except 40 122 were withdrawn the next day .",
      "The majority of Class 40s were cut up at Crewe , Doncaster , and Swindon works .",
      "Crewe works dismantled the most 40s , the totals are listed below .",
      "- Crewe Works scrapped 65 locos",
      "- Doncaster Works scrapped 64 locos",
      "- Swindon Works scrapped 54 locos .",
      "The other ten locos to be scrapped were cut at Derby , Glasgow , Inverkeithing , and Vic Berry at Leicester .",
      "1981 and 1983 saw the highest number of Class 40 withdrawals , a total of 41 locomotives being withdrawn both years .",
      "The very last Class 40s to be cut up were 40 091 and 40 195 by A . Hampton contractors at Crewe Works in December 1988 .",
      "Further use .",
      "The Class 40 story was not quite over , however . Upon the joint initiative of enthusiasts Howard Johnston and Murray Brown who noticed 40 122 on the withdrawn sidings at Carlisle Kingmoor depot in summer 1981 ready to go to Swindon Works for breaking up . 40 122 was reinstated by BR and overhauled at Toton depot with parts from 40 076 . Now in working condition and repainted in BR green , it was regularly used to haul normal passenger trains in the hope of attracting enthusiasts , as well as special trains . In addition , four locomotives were temporarily returned to service as Class 97 departmental locomotives , numbered 97 405\u2013408 . They were used to work engineering trains for a remodelling project at Crewe station . These were withdrawn by March 1987 .",
      "40 122 was eventually withdrawn in 1988 and presented to the National Railway Museum . Six other locomotives were preserved , and on 30 November 2002 , over sixteen years after the last Class 40 had hauled a mainline passenger train , the Class 40 Preservation Societys 40 145 hauled an enthusiasts railtour , The Christmas Cracker IV , from Crewe to Holyhead via Birmingham . Following a three-year hiatus , after suffering a traction motor flashover , 40 145 returned to mainline operation in 2014 .",
      "Accidents and incidents .",
      "- On 3 June 1962 . D244 , just 30 months old was at the head of the 22:15 Kings Cross - Edinburgh sleeper from the previous night . The train was diverted from Peterborough via Sleaford with a route conductor taking charge . Approaching Lincoln at 00:45 hours on the Sunday morning , too fast for a 15 mph permanent speed restriction , the locomotive lurched but stayed on the track , though its train of sleeping cars were all derailed . The rear portion of the train narrowly missed demolishing Pelham Street Signal Box . Three people were killed in the incident , including the Sleeping Car Attendant whilst 30 others were injured .",
      "- On 26 December 1962 , D215 Aquitania was hauling the up Mid-Day Scot when it collided with the rear of a Liverpool-Birmingham train , at Coppenhall Junction , Crewe . 18 were killed and 34 injured , including the guard . Contrary to popular belief , the infamous D326 was not hauling the train .",
      "- On 13 May 1966 , a freight train became divided between Norton Junction and Weaver Junction , Cheshire . Locomotive D322 , hauling an express passenger train , was in collision with the rear part of the freight train , which had run away . Both driver and secondman were killed . The locomotive was withdrawn in September 1967 .",
      "- On 7 May 1965 , a freight train was derailed at Preston-le-Skerne , County Durham . Locomotive No . D350 was hauling a newspaper train that ran into the derailed wagons and was itself derailed . Recovery of the locomotive was not until 16 May .",
      "- On 14 August 1966 , locomotive No . D311 was hauling a passenger train which was derailed when it ran into a landslip at Sanquhar , Dumfriesshire .",
      "- On 6 August 1975 , locomotive No . 40 189 was hauling a freight train which was unable to stop due to a lack of brake power . It was in collision with another freight train at Weaver Junction , Cheshire .",
      "- On 26 October 1975 , an express passenger train failed at Lunan , Angus . Locomotive No . 40 111 was sent to its assistance but ran into the rear of the failed train at . One person was killed and eleven were injured .",
      "- On 24 December 1977 , 40 164 was in collision with coaches ( due to form the 06:00 service to Mallaig ) in platform 5 of Glasgow Queen Street Station . The driver had lost control of the locomotive on the 1 in 45 descending gradient in Queen Street Tunnel . The cause of the accident was identified at the subsequent inquiry to packing pieces not having been inserted into the brake system after the locomotives wheels had been profiled on the wheel lathe , reducing their diameter .",
      "- In September 1978 , locomotive No . 40 044 was hauling a freight train that ran away and was derailed by trap points at Chinley , Derbyshire .",
      "D326 : The Great Train Robbery , 1963 .",
      "D326 ( later 40 126 ) was the most famous Class 40 , but for unfortunate reasons . The engine had an early chequered history , it was classed as a jinxed loco by some railwaymen , with some drivers being reluctant to drive it . In 1963 it was involved in the infamous Great Train Robbery , a year later in August 1964 a secondman was electrocuted when washing the windows . Finally , in August 1965 , it suffered total brake failure with a maintenance train at Birmingham New Street and hit the rear of a freight train , injuring the guard . It then settled down and had a normal life until it was scrapped in 1984 .",
      "40126 was withdrawn from service on 15 February 1984 . Upon withdrawal the locomotive was offered to the National Railway Museum at York as an exhibit loco regarding its past history , however , the NRM declined and was scrapped at Doncaster Works with indecent haste , no doubt to stop any pillaging souvenir hunters . Other famous 40s include 40 106 , which was the last one to remain in BR green livery , and 40 009 , the last 40 to still have vacuum brakes only .",

Not all locos may be carrying their names so ones noted show they arent currently carrying their names .",
      "Of the seven class 40s to be preserved all except for 40118 have run in preservation and three have run on the main line in preservation , these being Nos D200 ( 40122 ) , D213 ( 40013 ) and D345 ( 40145 ) . As of 2018 D213 & D345 are operational on the main line .",

      "Model railways .",
      "There have been quite a few models of Class 40s over the years . In OO gauge , French manufacturer Jouef entered the UK OO gauge market with a Class 40 model in about 1977 . This was available in blue or green , but only the disc headcode version was available ; it was not a very accurate model , being overly wide . Next , Lima produced a much better Class 40 from 1988 and was available with all four types of nose styles . Bachmann produced a super-detailed Class 40 in the early 2000s , but this was criticised somewhat for poor shape in the cab area . This was addressed by Bachmann later in production , when lighting was included and the drive was a true 1CO-CO1 arrangement .",

      "Lev Polugaevsky",
      "Lev Abramovich Polugaevsky ( ; 20 November 1934 \u2013 30 August 1995 ) was a Soviet chess player . He was awarded the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE in 1962 and was a frequent contender for the World Championship , although he never achieved that title . He was one of the strongest players in the world from the early 1960s until the late 1980s , as well as a distinguished author and opening theorist whose contributions in this field remain important to the present day .",
      "Career .",
      "Lev Polugaevsky was born in Mogilev , in the Soviet Union ( now Mahilyow , Belarus ) , and , after being evacuated during the Second World War , grew up in Kuybyshev ( modern Samara ) . He began playing chess around the age of 10 . In 1948 , he attracted the attention of Candidate Master Alexy Ivashin , who became his first teacher . International Master Lev Aronin , who lived in Moscow but had family in Kuybyshev , eventually became the teacher whom Polugaevsky credited most for his development . Additionally , between 1950 and 1953 he trained with Rashid Nezhmetdinov . Unlike many of his grandmaster colleagues , his development in chess came slowly , and he did not receive the Soviet master title until he was an adult . His progress then accelerated rapidly , however , and by the late 1960s he was one of the worlds strongest players , as was recognized by his participation in the famous USSR vs . Rest of the World match of 1970 . In this match he occupied fourth board , losing one game to Vlastimil Hort and drawing his other three . Until 1973 , Polugaevsky did not pursue chess as a career , working as an engineer and taking time off for tournaments .",
      "Polugaevsky won at Mar del Plata in 1962 and 1971 . He won or tied in the USSR Chess Championship three times . He played regularly in qualifying events to select a challenger for the world championship , qualifying for the Candidates matches on four occasions . His greatest advancement toward the title came during the 1977 and 1980 cycles , when he defeated Henrique Mecking and former world champion Mikhail Tal , respectively , in quarterfinal Candidates matches , before succumbing both times in the semifinals to the eventual challenger , Viktor Korchnoi .",
      "Polugaevsky played on the Soviet national team in seven Chess Olympiads , in 1966 , 1968 , 1970 , 1978 , 1980 , 1982 and 1984 . His team won the gold medal on each occasion , except in 1978 , when the USSR finished second to Hungary .",
      "Author .",
      "In addition to his over-the-board and theoretical successes , Polugaevsky was a highly respected chess author . His 1977 book Grandmaster Preparation ( now out of print ) is a classic that contains notable insights into his own thinking as he crafted the ultra-sharp eponymous variation in the main line ( 6 . Bg5 e6 7 . f4 b5 ) Najdorf Sicilian Defence . He went about his writing with the same meticulous care as characterized his analyses , and was contemptuous of the many less thorough authors who sought to profit from the post-Fischer chess boom with shoddy work , memorably commenting that Ninety per cent of all chess books you can open at page one and then immediately close again for ever . Sometimes you see books that have been written in one month . I dont like that . You should take at least two years for a book , or not do it [ at ] all .",

      "Death .",
      "To celebrate Polugaevskys 60th birthday , a Sicilian Defence-themed tournament was held in recognition of his contributions to the opening . The event was funded by Luis Rentero and took place in Buenos Aires in October 1994 . Polugaevsky was too ill to participate . He died of a brain tumour in 1995 .",
      "Legacy .",
      "Polugaevsky was a noted theorist whose work on a number of openings has stood the test of time . He is best remembered for a variation of the Sicilian Defence that bears his name : 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 b5! ? This of the Najdorf Sicilian leads to extraordinarily complicated tactical play on which the last word has still not been said , although theory seems to give White the upper hand .",
      "Illustrative games .",
      "This game from the 1969 Soviet championship against Tal would seem at first glance to be an example of Polugaevsky beating The Magician from Riga at his own sacrificial game . More subtly , however , it also reveals the depth of his opening knowledge and preparation . Polugaevsky had worked with Boris Spassky as the latter was preparing for his successful 1969 world championship match with Tigran Petrosian , and the two had made a searching analysis of the opening used in this game . Polugaevsky remarked later that the position as late as move 25 had appeared on the board during his analysis on the morning of the game ."

      "Ty Detmer",
      "Ty Hubert Detmer ( born October 30 , 1967 ) is an American football coach and former player . As a player , Detmer won the Heisman Trophy in 1990 while playing quarterback for Brigham Young University ( BYU ) . He went on to play professionally in the National Football League ( NFL ) for fourteen seasons . He was the offensive coordinator at BYU from 2015 to 2017 . At BYU , Detmer broke numerous NCAA records and was twice recognized as a consensus All-American . A late-round pick in the 1992 NFL Draft , Detmer played for six NFL teams , mostly in a back-up role . He is the older brother of former NFL quarterback Koy Detmer .",
      "Early years .",
      "Detmer was born in San Marcos , Texas . He attended Hobby Middle School , Mount Sacred Heart Middle School , and United Middle School in Laredo , Texas , and Southwest High School in San Antonio , Texas . He earned letters in golf , football , basketball , baseball , and track . As a senior , Detmer won high school All-American honors in football and was the Texas Player of the Year . He also won all-state honors in baseball and all-district accolades in basketball .",
      "College career .",
      "Detmer attended BYU , where he played for the BYU Cougars football team from 1987 to 1991 . In deciding which college to attend , he was in part attracted by BYUs alcohol-free environment . He redshirted for the Cougars during the 1987 season , and shared quarterback duties with Sean Covey as a redshirt freshman in 1988 . Detmer started only one game that year , but he made the most of the opportunity , passing for 333 yards and five touchdowns in a 65-0 victory over New Mexico . Later , he was named Most Valuable Player of the 1988 Freedom Bowl , after entering the game as a substitute and leading BYU to a come-from-behind 20\u201317 victory over the Colorado Buffaloes .",
      "Detmer became the full-time starter in 1989 . He emerged as one of the top quarterbacks in the nation , passing for 4,560 yards and 32 touchdowns during the regular season . His passer rating of 175.6 led the NCAA , and he finished second to Houstons Andre Ware in total offense . He led BYU to a Western Athletic Conference ( WAC ) Championship , the teams first since 1985 . Detmer finished the season with a strong performance against Penn State in the 1989 Holiday Bowl , setting NCAA records for most passing yards ( 576 ) and most yards of total offense ( 594 ) in a single bowl game . He finished ninth in the Heisman Trophy voting .",
      "Detmers 1990 junior season ranks as one of the greatest seasons for a quarterback in college football history . He passed for 5,188 yards and 41 touchdowns in 12 regular-season games , and finished the year with 42 NCAA records ( and tied for five others ) . The high point of the season was BYUs 28-21 upset victory over the top-ranked Miami Hurricanes ; Detmer led the Cougars by passing for 406 yards and three touchdowns against the defending national champions . For his performance that season , he was awarded the Heisman Trophy , as well as many other honors including the Maxwell and Davey OBrien awards . He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American , having been named to the first teams of the Associated Press , UPI , Newspaper Enterprise Association , Football Writers Association of America , Walter Camp Foundation , Football News , Scripps Howard , and the Sporting News . Unfortunately for Detmer and BYU , the season ended in disastrous fashion : the Cougars lost 59-28 in their final regular-season game against Hawaii , then lost 65-14 to Texas A&M in the 1990 Holiday Bowl . Detmer was knocked out of the game against Texas A&M , suffering two separated shoulders that required off-season surgery .",
      "The 1991 season started poorly for BYU , as the Cougars lost their first three games ( on a neutral field against #1 Florida State and road contests against #23 UCLA and #12 Penn State ) . After an 0\u20133 start , Detmer and BYU turned things around . The Cougars won eight straight games , and clinched their third consecutive WAC championship with a 52\u201352 tie against San Diego State in their final regular-season road game . In that contest , BYU fell behind 45\u201317 before Detmer led a comeback . He finished the game with 599 passing yards and six touchdowns , both career highs . In his final game as a Cougar , Detmer passed for 350 yards to lead BYU to a 13\u201313 tie against heavily favored #7 Iowa in the 1991 Holiday Bowl . He totaled 4,031 passing yards and 35 touchdowns in regular-season play during his senior year . He finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting , but won the Davey OBrien Award again and also earned the Sammy Baugh Trophy and Todays Top VI Award . Additionally , he was again recognized as a consensus first-team All-American .",
      "Detmer finished his college career with the following totals : 1,530 pass attempts ; 958 completions ; 15,031 passing yards ; 121 touchdown passes ; 14,665 yards of total offense ; 135 touchdowns responsible for ; and 162.7 passer rating\u2014all NCAA records at the time . In total , he finished his college career with 59 NCAA records and tied for three others . Including statistics from bowl games , Detmer amassed 16,206 passing yards and 127 touchdown passes at BYU . He graduated with a bachelors degree in recreation administration . In 2012 , Detmer was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame .",
      "Professional career .",
      "Green Bay Packers .",
      "Despite his success at BYU , many analysts thought that Detmer was too small to play quarterback in the NFL . The Green Bay Packers drafted him in the ninth round ( 230th pick overall ) of the 1992 NFL Draft . Detmer spent four seasons with the Packers , but appeared in only seven games while serving as back-up to starter Brett Favre .",
      "Philadelphia Eagles .",
      "Detmer found more playing time after signing a free-agent contract with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1996 . After Rodney Peete suffered a knee injury , Detmer became the teams starting quarterback . Detmer posted a 4\u20130 record in his first four starts . In his first start against the division rival New York Giants , Detmer completed 18 of 33 passes for 170 yards and no interceptions in the 19\u201310 victory . In his second start , he threw four touchdown passes ( all to Irving Fryar ) against the Miami Dolphins . The following week , he passed for a career-high 342 yards against the Carolina Panthers . The next week , he passed for 217 yards and a touchdown and added his first career rushing touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys . It was Philadelphias first victory at Dallas since 1991 , and earned Detmer the NFL Player of the Week award . A few weeks later , Detmer and the Eagles ended a three-game losing streak as they shut out the Giants in the rematch 24\u20130 . Detmer threw three touchdowns in the win . For the year , Detmer passed for 2,911 yards and 15 touchdowns ; his 80.8 passer rating ranked fourth among NFC quarterbacks . The Eagles posted a 7\u20134 record with Detmer as the starter during the 1996 season , good enough to enter the NFC playoffs . The following season , Detmer shared quarterback duties with Peete and Bobby Hoying .",
      "San Francisco 49ers .",
      "Detmer left Philadelphia in 1998 and joined the San Francisco 49ers as a backup to Steve Young . He spent only one season in San Francisco . His lone start came against the Panthers in which he passed for 276 yards and 3 touchdowns in the 49ers 25\u201323 victory . He was also the primary holder on field goals and PAT attempts , throwing a touchdown off a botched field goal attempt during a 1998 loss to the Patriots .",
      "Cleveland Browns .",
      "Detmer was traded to the Cleveland Browns in 1999 ; the Browns wanted him to mentor rookie quarterback Tim Couch . Detmer started the first game of the 1999 season , then served as backup until Couch sprained his foot in week 15 . He started the final game of the 1999 season . Detmer injured his right Achilles and was inactive the entire 2000 season .",
      "Detroit Lions .",
      "Detmer spent three seasons ( 2001 to 2003 ) with the Detroit Lions where he started four games during the 2001 season . His first start was a disaster : he threw seven interceptions against the Browns , the second-highest single-game total in NFL history ( tied with seven other players ) . He was eventually replaced as starter , but did start the final two games of the season . He set career highs for attempts ( 50 ) and completions ( 31 ) against the Chicago Bears , finishing with 303 passing yards . He closed out the season with 242 yards and 2 touchdowns against the Cowboys .",
      "Atlanta Falcons .",
      "Detmer spent the 2004 and 2005 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons , but did not see any action as the third-string quarterback behind Michael Vick and Matt Schaub .",
      "In 14 total seasons in the NFL , Detmer played in 54 games ( with 25 starts ) , totaling 6,351 yards passing with 34 touchdowns and 35 interceptions . Detmer did not officially retire from football at the time of his release from Atlanta , but he has not played since then .",
      "Coaching career .",
      "In December 2009 , he was appointed the new head football coach at St . Andrews Episcopal School . In December 2015 , Detmer became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at BYU , under new head coach Kalani Sitake . On November 27 , 2017 , Detmer was released from the coordinator position after just two seasons . The dismissal came following BYU footballs poor performance over the previous year .",
      "Personal life .",
      "Detmers brother Koy is a former NFL quarterback , and their father Sonny is a prominent San Antonio high school coach .",
      "Detmer was a major investor in , and employed by , the Athlete Services Division at Triton Financial Corporation from 2007 to 2009 . After the firm collapsed , founder Kurt Barton was indicted for fraud . Detmer , who was not implicated in the scandal , claims to have lost more money than anyone else . Overly trusting of Barton , whom he met at church , Detmer became a victim of affinity fraud ."

      "Nanayakkara joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party ( LSSP ) as student in 1958 . He was elected to parliament at the 1970 parliamentary election , representing Kiriella for the LSSP .",
      "Nanayakkara later left the LSSP and in 1977 joined with other former members of the LSSP , including Vikramabahu Karunaratne , to form the Nava Sama Samaja Party ( NSSP ) . He was the NSSPs candidate in Ehaliyagoda at 1977 parliamentary election but failed to get elected . He was the NSSPs candidate at the 1982 presidential election . He came fifth and last after receiving only 17,005 votes ( 0.26% ) .",
      "The Sri Lankan government proscribed the NSSP , Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP ) and Communist Party of Sri Lanka ( CP ) after the Black July anti-Tamil riots of 1983 . Nanayakkara , Karunaratne , Rohana Wijeweera and other left-wing politicians went into hiding until 1985 when the proscription was lifted .",
      "In 1987 the NSSP joined with the LSSP , CP and Sri Lanka Peoples Party to form the United Socialist Alliance ( USA ) . Nanayakkara re-entered parliament after the 1989 parliamentary election , representing Ratnapura District for the USA .",
      "Shortly before the 1994 parliamentary election Nanayakkara left the NSSP and rejoined the LSSP , one of the constituent parties of the Peoples Alliance ( PA ) , an alliance of opposition parties . He was chosen as one of the PAs parliamentary candidates for Ratnapura District and duly elected . Later Nanayakkara became critical of President Kumaratungas policies , such as privatisation and the handling of the civil war . He was suspended from the LSSP in April 1999 . A few days later Nanayakkara crossed over to the opposition in parliament .",
      "Nanayakkara then formed a new party called the Left & Democratic Alliance and stood as its candidate , against President Kumaratunga , at the 1999 presidential election . He came seventh after receiving 23,668 votes ( 0.28% ) .",
      "The Left & Democratic Alliance was later renamed the Democratic Left Front ( DLF ) . It joined the United Peoples Freedom Alliance ( UPFA ) , the successor to the PA . Nanayakkara was chosen as the UPFAs mayoral candidate for Colombo at the 2006 local government elections . He was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council but the UPFA failed to gain control of the council . Nanayakkara became the leader of the opposition on the council .",

      "The party was founded in April 1987 by splinters from Piedmontese Union ( Union Piemont\u00e8isa , UP ) led by Gipo Farassino and Mario Borghezio . This group , which took the name of Piedmontese Autonomist Movement ( Moviment Autonomista Piemont\u00e8is , MAP ) and later Autonomist Piedmont ( Piemont Autonomista , PA ) , wanted to make an alliance with Lega Lombarda of Umberto Bossi , in contrast with UP leader Roberto Gremmo .",
      "PA participated in the 1989 European Parliament election as part of the coalition Lega Lombarda \u2013 Alleanza Nord . In 1989\u20131990 it took part to the process of integration of the Northern regionalist parties , ahead of regional elections , and , finally , in February 1991 , it was merged into Lega Nord , taking the current name .",
      "In 1994 Farassino fended off a challenge by Oreste Rossi and was narrowly re-elected national secretary .",
      "In the 1996 general election the party obtained its highest result : 18.2% .",
      "In 1997 Farassino was replaced as secretary by Domenico Comino .",
      "Splits and recovery .",
      "In 1999 the party suffered a damaging split when Comino left the party over disagreements with Umberto Bossi , federal secretary of Lega Nord , and started his own party , which was integrated into the Autonomists for Europe ( ApE ) in 2000 .",
      "Troubled by splits and a huge loss of popular support ( the party was reduced from 18.2% to 7.8% in just three years ) , LNP entered into the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition . From 2000 to 2005 the party took part to the regional government led by Enzo Ghigo ( Forza Italia ) , which included LNP long-time leader Gipo Farassino as regional minister of Culture , while Roberto Cota was appointed President of the Regional Council .",
      "In 2001 Cota was elected national secretary of LNP with the mandate of re-building the party .",
      "Between 2006 and 2008 the party doubled its share of vote from 6.3% to 12.3% . Subsequently , Cota became floor leader of Lega Nord in the Chamber of Deputies .",
      "In the 2009 European Parliament election LNP increased again its share reaching 15.7% , its best electoral result since 1996 .",
      "Cota President of Piedmont .",
      "In the run-up of the 2010 regional election , Cota was chosen as joint candidate for President by The People of Freedom ( PdL ) and Lega Nord .",
      "During the campaign , Cota declared it was time to rewrite the history of Italian unification , that was led by the Kingdom of Sardinia under the House of Savoy , as even Camillo Benso di Cavour , Italys first Prime Minister , did not intend to unify the whole Italian Peninsula and , later , favoured a federal reform of the new Kingdom of Italy : Piedmont was to be once again independent . Cota , a republican with no nostalgia for the monarchy , maintained that his message would do well and he would overcome the relative weakness of LNP if compared with Liga Veneta ( Veneto ) and Lega Lombarda ( Lombardy ) . In Cotas view , most of his support would come from industrial workers , including those of Southern Italian descent , and Catholics embarrassed by incumbent President Mercedes Bressos secularism .",
      "In March Cota was narrowly elected President ( he took 47.3% of the vote against Bressos 46.9% ) and LNP tripled the number of its seats in the Regional Council from four to twelve . Instrumental for Cotas victory were the strong showing of Beppe Grillos Five Star Movement , which gained 3.7% of the vote mainly from centre-left voters , and the Catholic vote that tilted to Cota , disappointing the Union of the Centre , allied with Bresso in the election .",
      "Cota was forced to resign in early 2014 , due to irregularities committed in 2010 by one of its supporting lists in filing the slates for the regional election , and chose not to stand again . In the 2014 regional election Democrat Sergio Chiamparino was elected President of Piedmont and LNP was reduced to a mere 7.3% of the vote .",
      "From Cota to Molinari .",
      "In February 2016 , during a hard-fought national congress , Riccardo Molinari replaced Cota as national secretary . Molinari , who was supported by the new Lega Nord federal secretary Matteo Salvini , obtained 446 votes ( 55.1% ) from delegates , while his opponent Gianna Gancia , the incumbent national president chiefly supported by Gianluca Buonanno MEP and her husband and party heavyweight Roberto Calderoli , 364 votes ( 44.9% ) . Subsequently , Stefano Allasia was elected president .",
      "In the 2018 general election the party obtained 22.6% of the vote , its best result ever . However , in the 2019 regional election , the party exceeded that result , gaining 37.1% of the vote .",
      "Popular support .",
      "The party has its strongholds in the outer provinces , as well as in rural and in mountain areas of Piedmont . In the 2010 regional election it won 25.3% in Cuneo , 24.4% in Vercelli , 21.6% in Verbano-Cusio-Ossola , 21.1% in Novara , 20.6% in Asti and 20.2% in Biella . In the more recent 2018 general election the party obtained 25-28% in the single-seat constituencies of southern Piedmont ( Cuneo , Alba , Asti and Alessandria ) and those of northern Piedmont ( Novara , Biella and Verbania ) .",

      "Guy Gabaldon",
      "Guy Louis Gabaldon ( March 22 , 1926 \u2013 August 31 , 2006 ) was a United States Marine who , at age 18 , claimed to have captured or persuaded to surrender over 1,300 Japanese soldiers and civilians during the battles for Saipan and Tinian islands in 1944 during World War II . Though Gabaldon was recommended for the Medal of Honor , he received the Silver Star , which was upgraded by the Marine Corps to the Navy Cross in 1960 .",
      "In 1960 , a friend of Gabaldons with Hollywood connections influenced the industry to make a movie about Gabaldons version of events on Saipan called Hell to Eternity . He was called Gabby by his friends , but he became known as The Pied Piper of Saipan for his heroism on that island . In 1964 , he unsuccessfully ran for US Congressman in his Southern California district . In 1990 , he authored a book entitled , Saipan : Suicide Island .",
      "Early years .",
      "Gabaldon was born in Los Angeles , California . Gabaldon , who was of Mexican descent , was one of seven children . He was raised in East Los Angeles and , as a ten-year-old , he helped his family by shining shoes on Skid Row . Gabaldon became a member of a multi-ethnic gang known as the Moe Gang . At age 12 , he moved out of his home to live with the Nakano family , who were of Japanese heritage and whom he considered his extended family . He attended language school every day with their children and learned to speak Japanese . He also learned about their customs and culture .",
      "World War II .",
      "At the outbreak of World War II the Nakanos , his adopted family , were sent to a relocation camp named the Heart Mountain Relocation Center , in Wyoming . He traveled to Alaska to work in a cannery . On March 22 , 1943 , Gabaldons 17th birthday , he joined the United States Marine Corps . He received his basic training at Camp Pendleton , completed the Enlisted Marine Japanese Language School at Camp Elliot in San Diego , and was assigned to Headquarters and Service Company , 2nd Marine Regiment , 2nd Marine Division , as a scout and observer .",
      "The Pied Piper of Saipan .",
      "The capture of Saipan was considered essential for the establishment of airfields which would accommodate the B-29 Superfortress bombers to be used in what was then the planned full-scale invasion of the Japanese mainland . On June 15 , 1944 , an armada of 535 ships , carrying 127,570 U.S . military personnel which included Marines from the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions , began the invasion of Saipan . Japanese soldiers seldom surrendered during World War II and , as the American military invasion went badly for the Japanese , they were ordered by their superiors on Saipan to kill seven American Marines or soldiers for every soldier they lost , or commit suicide .",
      "According to Gabaldon , he began taking and bringing in prisoners the night of the first day that he arrived on Saipan . According to Gabaldon :",
      "Gabaldon was reprimanded by his superior officers , and threatened with a court-martial for leaving his post . However , according to him the next night he went out and did it again . He carefully approached a cave , shot the enemy guards outside , moved off to one side of the cave , and yelled in Japanese , Youre surrounded and have no choice but to surrender . Come out , and you will not be killed ! I assure you will be well-treated . We do not want to kill you !",
      "The next morning he says he returned with 50 Japanese prisoners . As a result , Gabaldon was permitted by his commanding officer to act as a lone wolf operator .",
      "The next day , on July 8 , Gabaldon captured two more enemy guards . He convinced one of them to return to his cave , with an offering of surrender . Shortly thereafter , a Japanese officer showed up . After speaking to Gabaldon , the officer accepted the conditions of surrender\u2014and over eight hundred Japanese soldiers and civilians surrendered to Gabaldon , who turned them over to the U.S . military authorities . For his exploits , according to Gabaldon , he became known as The Pied Piper of Saipan .",
      "Contrary opinions on Gabaldons actions on Saipan .",
      "In the book , One Marines War : A Combat Interpreters Quest for Mercy in the Pacific by Gerald A . Meehl , about USMC Japanese Language Officer Robert Sheeks , who also served on Saipan , Gabaldon is described by Sheeks as a relentless self-promoter who grossly exaggerated his exploits on Saipan and Tinian and that most of the Japanese he captured were civilians , not soldiers as he claimed . The book states that the number of Japanese captured by Gabaldon was likely about half of the 1,500 that he claimed . A total of 15,000 Japanese miliary and civilians and Pacific Islanders were captured or detained by the US during and after the battle . Many others besides Gabaldon were involved in those efforts , but according to Sheeks , Gabaldon minimized the involvement of others when talking about his exploits during and after the battle .",
      "Author Gerald A . Meehl in interviews with Saipan veterans and in other records , found reports of abusive behavior by Gabaldon towards Japanese civilians and soldiers he encountered on Saipan . In one instance , witnessed by Sheeks , Gabaldon struck and broke the jaw of an elderly Japanese civilian who did not answer one of Gabaldons questions quickly enough .",
      "Tinian .",
      "Gabaldon continued to capture more Japanese people on Tinian . While back on Saipan fighting Japanese guerrillas still on the island , he was seriously wounded in an enemy machine gun ambush . Gabaldon claimed he was credited with the capture of approximately 1,500 Japanese soldiers and civilians on Saipan and Tinian and was recommended for the Medal of Honor by his commanding officer Captain John Schwabe , who noted that Gabaldon single-handedly captured more than ten times the number of prisoners taken by legendary Medal of Honor recipient , Sgt . Alvin C . York , in World War I . Despite this recommendation , Gabaldon was awarded a Silver Star Medal .",
      "Post-war .",
      "Gabaldon received an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps as a result of his combat wounds . In 1960 , the Marine Corps elevated his Silver Star Medal to the Navy Cross , the second highest US military decoration for valor .",
      "After returning to civilian life , he moved to Mexico and ventured into various businesses such as a furniture store , fishing , and the import-export of Mexican goods . When his first marriage to June Gabaldon ended in divorce , he met the woman who became his second wife , Ohana Suzuki , while working in Mexico .",
      "Gabaldons World War II exploits became public when in 1957 , he was the invited guest of This is Your Life , a popular television program aired by NBC in the 1950s . Hosted by Ralph Edwards , the show presented the life stories of entertainment personalities and ordinary people who had contributed in some way to society . Later , Gabaldon appeared as himself on the September 1 , 1960 episode of the CBS game show To Tell the Truth .",
      "The fact that Gabaldon captured at least 1,500 Japanese prisoners was verified on the national program by Marines Corps intelligence officers Colonel Walter Layer , Colonel John Schwabe , Major James High , and several enlisted men from military intelligence .",
      "Hollywood producers became interested in Gabaldons story and in 1960 released the film Hell to Eternity where his actions on Saipan were memorialized . He was portrayed by actors Jeffrey Hunter as an adult and by Richard Eyer as a boy . Gabaldon himself served as an adviser in the filming of the movie .",
      "Later years .",
      "In 1964 , Gabaldon unsuccessfully ran for the United States Congress as a Republican in California .",
      "In 1970 , he moved to Saipan with his wife where he established a seafood business and ran a youth camp . He lived there for 20 years . He was an avid pilot and flew small planes all over the CNMI .",
      "In 1990 , he authored and self-published a book ; Saipan : Suicide Island , also re-printed as America Betrayed .",
      "In 1995 , he returned to California .",
      "In 2003 , he moved to Old Town , Florida .",
      "In September 2004 , Gabaldon was honored by the Pentagon , in a ceremony which recognized the contributions of Hispanic American World War II veterans .",
      "Various organizations have requested the Medal of Honor for Gabaldon , but their requests have been rejected . After lobbying by the Hispanic community , the case to upgrade his Navy Cross to the Medal of Honor is currently under review by the Department of Defense .",
      "Death .",
      "On August 31 , 2006 , Gabaldon died in Old Town , Florida , of heart disease . He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery . Gabaldon is survived by his wife , Ohana ; his sons Guy Jr. , Ray , Tony , Yoshio , Jeffrey and Russell ; his daughters Aiko , Hanako and Manya . Two members of his adopted family were actor Lane Nakano and his twin Lyle .",
      "Awards and recognitions .",
      "During his lifetime , Gabaldon received many awards and recognitions , including resolutions honoring him from the City of Los Angeles , the City of Chicago , and the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas .",
      "On November 12 , 2005 , he was the recipient of the Chesty Puller Award from the World War II Veterans Committee , a prominent organization which showcases the veterans of World War II and their history .",
      "On July 7 , 2006 , he was honored by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles City Council . The Mayor and the city council sent a resolution to the White House requesting the Medal of Honor for Gabaldon . That same year the World War II Veterans Committee in Washington , D.C. , featured Gabaldon on the cover of their quarterly magazine . Also in July , Gabaldon was honored by the National Council of La Raza , a national organization and a leading Latino civil rights advocate .",
      "In addition to the Hollywood movie Hell to Eternity , which recounted Gabaldons heroism during World War II , Hollywood producer Steve Rubin made a documentary film about Gabaldon titled East L.A . Marine : The Untold True Story of Guy Gabaldon . Military artist Henry Godines also unveiled a commissioned portrait , titled The Pied Piper of Saipan , Guy Gabaldon .",

      "Ghaziabad ( ) is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and a part of the NCR . It is the administrative headquarters of Ghaziabad district and is the largest city in western Uttar Pradesh , with a population of 1,729,000 . Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation is divided into 5 zones - City Zone , Kavi Nagar Zone , Vijay Nagar Zone , Mohan Nagar Zone and Vasundhara Zone . The Municipal Corporation comprises 100 wards . Well connected by roads and railways , it is a major rail junction for North India . It is sometimes referred to as the Saya of Uttar Pradesh because it is close to New Delhi , on the main route into Uttar Pradesh . Recent construction works have led to the city being described by a City Mayors Foundation survey as the second fastest-growing in the world . Situated in the Upper Gangetic Plains , the city has two major divisions separated by the Hindon River , namely Trans-Hindon on the west and Cis-Hindon on the east .",
      "History .",
      "The city of Ghaziabad was founded in 1740 A.D . by Ghazi-ud-Din , who served as a wazir in the court of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah , and named it as Ghaziuddinnagar after his own name . The name Ghaziuddinnagar was shortened to its present form , i.e . Ghaziabad with the opening of the Railways in 1864 . During the Mughal period , Ghaziabad and especially the banks of the Hindon in Ghaziabad , remained a picnic spot for the Mughal royal family .",
      "Establishment of the Scientific Society here , during the same period is considered as a milestone of the educational movement launched by Syed Ahmad Khan . The Scinde , Punjab & Delhi Railway , connecting Delhi and Lahore , up till Ambala through Ghaziabad was opened in the same year . With the completion of the Amritsar-Saharanpur-Ghaziabad line of the Sind , Punjab and Delhi Railway in 1870 , Delhi was connected to Multan through Ghaziabad , and Ghaziabad became the junction of the East Indian Railway and Sind , Punjab and Delhi Railway .",
      "Ghaziabad , along with Meerut and Bulandshahr , remained one of the three Munsifis of the District , under the Meerut Civil Judgeship during most periods of the British Raj .",
      "Ghaziabad was associated with the Indian independence movement from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 .",
      "Industrial growth .",
      "Although connected by railway since 1865 , it was not until 1940 that the first modern industry appeared in Ghaziabad . However , it was in the post-independence period that industry really expanded , with a further 22 factories opening in the four years after 1947 . This development can be attributed to the influx of people from the newly formed Pakistan and the relocation of businesses from what was now the Pakistani province of Punjab . John Oakey and Mohan Ltd. , one of Indias largest concerns manufacturing coated and bonded abrasives , and originally functioning under the name of National Abrasives at Rawalpindi was shifted here under the proprietorship of Dyer Meakins in 1947 . Subsequently , the Mohan Meakin breweries were also set up in the year 1949 . This period also saw the development of Ghaziabad as one of Indias most famous centres of the Oil Engines industry .",
      "In 1967 , the municipal limits were extended up to the Delhi-UP border . Starting in the early 1970s , many steel-manufacturing units also came up in the city making it one of the primary industries of the city . This period also saw the emergence of the Electronics industry , with the setting up of Bharat Electronics Limited and Central Electronics Limited Over the years , planned Industrial development saw participation from major industrial houses of the country including Mohans ( Mohan Nagar Industrial Estate , 1949 ) , Tatas ( Tata Oil Mills ) , Modis ( Modinagar , 1933 ; International Tobacco Co . 1967 ) , Shri Rams ( Shri Ram Pistons , 1964 ) , Jaipurias etc . and also significant participation through foreign capital in concerns such as Danfoss India Ltd . ( estd . 1968 ) ; Indo- Bulgar Food Ltd . and International Tobacco Company ( estd . 1967 ) .",

Rajasthans dust storms and snowfall in the Himalayas and Kumaon hills name their impact in the weather regularly . The monsoon arrives in the district at the end of June or the first week of July and normally it rains until October .",
      "As in other districts of northern India mainly three seasons - summer , winter and rainy - prevail here , but sometimes due to severe snowfall in the Himalayas and Kumaon Hills , adverse weather can also be seen .",

      "The corporation supplies water and has nearly 2.35 lakh water connections , supplying nearly 388 MLD of water per day . The city also receives water from the Ganga through 50 cusec ( one cubic foot of water flow per second which translates into 28.32 litres ) and 100 cusec plants but a lot of areas in the city constituting multi-storied apartments do not receive Ganga water and rely on groundwater . Treated water is supplied to only 36.2% of households .",

      "Luftflotte 5 ( Air Fleet 5 ) was one of the primary divisions of the German Luftwaffe in World War II . It was formed 12 April 1940 in Hamburg for the invasion of Norway .",
      "It transferred to Oslo , Norway on 24 April 1940 and was the organization responsible for Luftwaffe activity in Occupied Norway throughout the Second World War .",
      "History .",
      "Luftflotte 5 was responsible for German air operations during the invasion of Norway , and for the defence of the occupied territory thereafter . It was divided into various operational formations , governing air forces , and into Air Districts ( Luftgau ) controlling ground forces and facilities .",
      "In 1940 , for the invasion , its main air asset was Fliegerkorps X , a formation comprising four bomber and one fighter wings ( Geschwader ) together with air support forces . With the conclusion of the Norwegian campaign Fliegerkorps X was moved to other theatres ( first to the Battle of Britain , then to the Mediterranean Sea ) .",
      "On 15 August 1940 the Luftwaffe mounted the largest number of sorties of the Battle of Britain . Luftflotte 5 attacked the north of England . Believing Fighter Command strength to be concentrated in the south , raiding forces from Denmark and Norway ran into unexpectedly strong resistance . Inadequately escorted by Bf 110s , bombers were shot down in large numbers . North East England was attacked by 65 Heinkel He 111s escorted by 34 Messerschmitt Bf 110s , and RAF Driffield was attacked at midday by 50 unescorted Junkers Ju 88s . Out of 115 bombers and 35 fighters sent , 16 bombers and 7 fighters were destroyed . As a result of these casualties , Luftflotte 5 did not appear in strength again in the campaign .",
      "After the invasion of Norway air operations came under Fliegerf\u00fchrer ( Ff ) Nord , an ad hoc formation of assigned squadrons ( Staffel ) and groups ( Gruppe ) . From June 1941 fighter forces in Norway came under the separate command of Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Norwegen . Total forces amounted to three fighter groups and one bomber group , with attached night fighter and fighter bomber squadrons plus auxiliaries .",
      "On the ground Luftflotte 5s assets were administered by a single air district , Luftgau Kommando ( LgK ) Norwegen , with subordinate commands operating airfields around Oslo , Kristiansand , Bergen , and Stavanger in the south , Trondheim , in the centre , and Narvik and Kirkenes in the north of the country .",
      "In 1941 , with the invasion of the Soviet Union and the entry of Finland into the war as Germanys ally , a second air district was formed ( LgK Finnland ) around Rovaniemi , to co-ordinate German air activity on the northern front and Operation Silberfuchs .",
      "In June 1942 Ff Nord was divided into three separate commands ; Ff Nord West ( North ( West ) ) , organized from Trondheim ; Ff Lofoten operating from the Lofoten Islands against Allied convoys to Murmansk and the Soviet arctic ports ; and Ff Nord Ost ( North ( East ) ) , supporting Army operations against Murmansk and the northern front . In the summer of 1942 Ff Lofoten was reinforced with two bomber groups formed specifically for maritime operations .",
      "In 1944 these formations were reorganized again ; Nord Ost became , briefly Ff Eismeer before becoming Ff 3 ; Nord West became Ff 4 ; and Lofoten became Ff 5 .",
      "On the ground LgK Norwegen became Kommandierende General der Luftwaffe ( K.G. ) in Norwegen , covering ground and air formations in Norway , while LgK Finnland became K.G . Finnland , with a similar remit in Finland and , later , northern Norway .",
      "As the war progressed however these organizations became increasingly irrelevant as German forces were forced to retreat and their air strength diminished . By the end of World War II they existed largely on paper .",

      "Minna Canth",
      "Minna Canth ( IPA [ minna ka:nt ] , born Ulrika Wilhelmina Johnson , 19 March 1844 \u2013 12 May 1897 ) was a Finnish writer and social activist . Canth began to write while managing her family drapers shop and living as a widow raising seven children . Her work addresses issues of womens rights , particularly in the context of a prevailing culture she considered antithetical to permitting expression and realization of womens aspirations . The Workers Wife and The Pastors Family are her best known plays , but the play Anna Liisa is the most adapted to the films and operas . In her time , she became a controversial figure , due to the asynchrony between her ideas and those of her time , and in part due to her strong advocacy for her point of view .",
      "Minna Canth was the first major Finnish-language playwright and prose writer after Aleksis Kivi , the national author of Finland , and the first Finnish-language newspaper woman . She was also the first woman to receive her own flag day in Finland , starting on 19 March 2007 . It is also the day of social equality in Finland .",
      "Life and career .",
      "Canth was born in Tampere to Gustaf Vilhelm Johnsson ( 1816\u20131877 ) and his wife Ulrika ( 1811\u20131893 ) . His father worked at James Finlaysons textile factory initially as a worker and later as a foreman . Gustaf and Ulrika had four children , Minna included , of whom the eldest , Adolf , died in infancy . Minnas surviving siblings were Gustaf ( 1850\u20131894 ) and Augusta ( 1852\u20131877 ) . In 1853 his father was given charge of Finlaysons textile shop in Kuopio and the entire family relocated there .",
      "Canth received an exceptionally thorough education for a working-class woman of her time . Even before moving to Kuopio she had attended school at Finlaysons factory which was intended for the workers children . In Kuopio she continued to go to various girls schools and as a testament to her fathers success as a shopkeeper , she was even admitted into a school intended for upper class children . In 1863 she began her studies at the recently founded Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Teacher Seminary , which was the first school in Finland to offer higher education for women .",
      "In 1865 she married her natural sciences teacher , Johan Ferdinand Canth ( 1835\u20131879 ) , and had to drop out of the Seminary . Between 1866 and 1880 she gave birth to seven children : Anni ( 1866\u20131911 ) , Elli ( 1868\u20131944 ) , Hanna ( 1870\u20131889 ) , Maiju ( 1872\u20131943 ) , Jussi ( 1874\u20131929 ) , Pekka ( 1876\u20131959 ) and Lyyli ( 1880\u20131969 ) ; her husband Johan died in 1879 shortly before the birth of the familys seventh child . She began her writing career at the newspaper Keski-Suomi , where her husband worked as an editor . She wrote about womens issues and advocated temperance . In 1876 the Canths were forced to leave the paper because Minnas writings had roused some bad blood ; they were , however , both employed by the competing P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne the following year . Minna published her first works of fiction on the pages of P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne : various short stories , which were compiled in her first book , Novelleja ja kertomuksia , in 1878 .",
      "Canth died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 53 on May 12 , 1897 at her home in Kuopio . She was buried in a family grave in Kuopio Cemetery .",
      "Debate .",
      "Canth stood out when there was public debate about womens rights . In 1885 a bishop had argued that Gods order required that women were not emancipated . The writer Gustaf af Geijerstam then argued that men could only aspire to one day have the purity of women because they were fundamentally different and this was the reason for prostitution and other immorality . Canth objected strongly to this argument as it meant that men could defend their poor morals by reference to their implicit shortcomings , whereas any women involved in prostitution would lack the same defence .",
      "Most important works .",
      "Minna Canths most important works are the plays Ty\u00f6miehen vaimo ( The Workers Wife ) from 1885 and Anna Liisa , penned in 1895 .",
      "In Ty\u00f6miehen vaimo , the main character Johanna is married to Risto , an alcoholic who wastes all his wifes money . Johanna cannot prevent him \u2013 her money is legally his , not hers . The plays premiere caused scandal , but a few months later , parliament enacted a new law about separation of property .",
      "Anna Liisa is a tragedy about a fifteen-year-old girl who gets pregnant without being married \u2013 she manages to hide her pregnancy , and when the child is born , she suffocates it in a fit of panic . Her boyfriend Mikkos mother helps her \u2013 she buries the baby in the woods , but a few years later , when Anna Liisa wants to marry her fianc\u00e9 Johannes , she is blackmailed by Mikko and his mother . They threaten her to reveal her dark secret if she does not agree to marry Mikko , but Anna Liisa refuses . In the end , she decides to confess what she has done . She is taken to prison , but is much relieved after owning up and seems to have found peace .",
      "In popular culture .",
      "A two-part television mini-series about Minna Canth called Minna , written by and directed by , was released in 1977 . In the mini-series , Minna Canth is played by .",
      "Tribute .",

      "Galatasaray Spor Kul\u00fcb\u00fc ( , Galatasaray Sports Club ) is a professional football club based on the European side of the city of Istanbul in Turkey . It is the association football branch of the larger Galatasaray Sports Club of the same name , itself a part of the Galatasaray Community Cooperation Committee which includes Galatasaray High School where the football club was founded in October 1905 consisting entirely of student members . The team traditionally play in dark shades of red and yellow at home , with the shirts split down the middle between the two colours .",
      "Galatasaray have won 22 S\u00fcper Lig titles , 18 Turkish Cups and 16 Turkish Super Cups . Galatasaray is one of three teams to have participated in all seasons of the S\u00fcper Lig since 1959 , following the dissolution of the Istanbul Football League .",
      "Internationally , Galatasaray has won the UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 2000 , becoming the first and only Turkish team to win a major UEFA competition . In the 1999\u20132000 season , the club achieved the rare feat of completing a quadruple by winning the S\u00fcper Lig , the Turkish Cup , the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in a single season . Galatasaray is also the only Turkish club to have been ranked first on the IFFHS World Rankings .",
      "Since 2011 , the clubs stadium is the 52,332-capacity T\u00fcrk Telekom Stadium in Seyrantepe , Istanbul . Previously , the club played at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium , as well as a succession of other grounds in Istanbul , which included groundshares with Be\u015fikta\u015f and Fenerbah\u00e7e at the Taksim Stadium and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc Stadium .",
      "The club has a long-standing rivalry with other major Istanbul teams , namely with Be\u015fikta\u015f and Fenerbah\u00e7e . The derby between Galatasaray and Fenerbah\u00e7e is dubbed the K\u0131talar Aras\u0131 Derbi ( ) due to the location of their headquarters and stadiums on the European ( Galatasaray ) and Asian ( Fenerbah\u00e7e ) sides of the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul .",
      "As a result of the teams 20th championship for the 2014\u201315 S\u00fcper Lig season , their logo hereafter contains four stars representing their 20 championships for the league ; each star corresponds to five of the teams championships . Galatasaray is the first and only four-star sports club in Turkish Football League .",
      "History .",
      "Galatasaray SK was founded in October 1905 ( the exact day is disputed , but is traditionally accepted as 17 Te\u015frinievvel 1321 according to the Rumi calendar , which corresponds to 30 October 1905 according to the Gregorian calendar ) by albanian Ali Sami Yen and other students of Galatasaray High School ( a high school in Istanbul which was established in 1481 ) as a football club . Ali Sami Yen became Galatasaray SKs first president and was given the clubs membership number 1 . The teams first match was against Cadi-Keuy FC and Galatasaray won this match with a score of 2\u20130 . There were discussions about the clubs name , in which some suggested Gloria ( victory ) and others Audace ( courage ) , but it was decided that its name would be Galatasaray .",
      "In addition to Ali Sami Yen ( Club member No . 1 ) , who was the driving force behind the clubs foundation , Asim Tevfik Sonumut ( 2 ) , Emin B\u00fclent Serdaro\u011flu ( 3 ) , Celal \u0130brahim ( 4 ) , Boris Nikolov ( 5 ) , Milo Baki\u0107 ( 6 ) , Pavle Baki\u0107 ( 7 ) , Bekir S\u0131tk\u0131 Bircan ( 8 ) , Tahsin Nihat ( 9 ) , Re\u015fat \u015eirvanizade ( 10 ) , H\u00fcseyin H\u00fcsn\u00fc ( 11 ) , Refik Cevdet Kalpak\u00e7\u0131o\u011flu ( 12 ) and Abidin Daver ( 13 ) were also involved in the decision to organize such a club .",
      "The name Galatasaray itself comes from that of Galatasaray High School , which in turn takes its name from Galata Saray\u0131 Ender\u00fbn-u H\u00fcm\u00e2y\u00fbn ( Galata Palace Imperial School ) , the name of the original school founded on the site in 1481 , and which in turn took its name from the nearby medieval Genoese citadel of Galata ( the modern quarter of Karak\u00f6y ) in the Beyo\u011flu ( Pera ) district of Istanbul . Galatasaray literally means Galata palace .",
      "According to researcher Cem Atabeyo\u011flu , Galatasaray took its name from one of its first matches . In that match , Galatasaray won 2\u20130 over a local Greek club , and the spectators called them Galata Saray\u0131 efendileri ( English : Gentlemen of Galata Palace ) , and , after this incident , they adopted that name and started to call their club Galata Saray\u0131 . In 1905 , during the era of the Ottoman Empire , there were no laws for associations so the club could not be registered officially , but , after the 1912 Law of Association , the club registered legally .",

Galatasaray won three of these seven titles .",
      "T\u00fcrkiye Profesyonel 1 . Ligi ( Turkish Super League today ) formed in 1959 . This is the top-flight professional league in Turkish nationwide football , and the most popular sporting competition in the country . Galatasaray joined all seasons and won 22 league titles since then .",

This is the only national cup competition in Turkey . Galatasaray joined all seasons and won 16 trophies since then .",
      "Probably the greatest record that the club holds is winning national championships in 15 different sport branches in the 1986\u201387 season . Another achievement in this period was reaching the semi-final of the European Cup in the 1988\u201389 season , making Galatasaray the first and only Turkish team to have played a semi-final in this competition .",
      "Galatasarays most successful era came in the late 1990s , when the club become the first and only Turkish football club to win a major UEFA competition . They were aided in this by one of Turkeys best generation of homegrown footballers who went on to finish third in the 2002 FIFA World Cup , after having played in the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2000 . Besides the talented players , visiting teams also disliked traveling into Ali Sami Yen Stadium , literally dubbed Hell by Galatasaray supporters due to the intimidating atmosphere provided by the fans including chants and riots in the crowds .",
      "There are many successful footballers who have played for Galatasaray and made their mark on Turkish football history .

      "Name and pronunciation .",
      "Galatasaray ( ) is a quarter in Karak\u00f6y in the Beyo\u011flu district of Istanbul , located at the northern shore of the Golden Horn . Its name comes from that of Galata , which may in turn have derived from Galatai ( meaning the Galatians ) , as the Celtic tribes were thought to have camped at Galata during the Hellenistic period before settling in Galatia in central Anatolia . Galatasaray translates directly as Galata Palace ( saray means palace in Persian ) . Galatasaray High School , established in the area in 1481 , was the progenitor of Galatasaray S.K . as well as other institutions of Galatasaray Community .",
      "Galatasaray is a compound word and is pronounced as such , with a very brief pause between the two words . There is no diminutive form of the clubs name . Fans refer to the club either by its full name or by its nickname Cim-Bom ( -Bom ) , ) \u2014of uncertain etymology . However , the shortened form Gala is sometimes used by English speakers .",
      "Crest and colours .",
      "Galatasarays first emblem was drawn by 333 [ School Number ] \u015eevki Ege . This was the figure of a spread-winged eagle with a football in its beak . The eagle was a model emblem that Galatasaray dwelled on in the beginning . But when the name did not attract too much interest , \u015eevki Eges composition was pushed aside . It was replaced by the current design in the 1920s . This replaced in 1925 by the current Ghayn-Sin crest , which are the first two Arabic letters of Galata Saray , designed by Ayetullah Emin .",
      "At first , the colours of Galatasaray were red and white . These are the colours in the modern Turkish flag . The Turkish Republic , however , was not founded at that time . Therefore , this decision caused the repressive administration of the day to feel uncomfortable and the administration subsequently pressured the footballers . For this reason , on December 26 , 1906 the colors were changed to yellow and black . The eight-piece halved design kit was ordered from the Sports Outfitter William Shillcock based in Birmingham , United Kingdom . After a heavy 0-5 loss to Baltaliman\u0131 in a friendly match the new colours yellow and black were counted as inauspicious .",
      "On 6 December 1908 , for a match against the football team of the Royal Navy cruiser , Galatasaray finally settled on playing in red and yellow , inspired by the roses which G\u00fcl Baba offered to Sultan Bayezid II .",
      "Ali Sami Yen stated , After we have been in and out of several shops , we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fatty Yankos store at Bah\u00e7ekap\u0131s\u0131 ( between Emin\u00f6n\u00fc and Sirkeci in Istanbul , now called Bah\u00e7ekap\u0131 ) . One of them was quite dark red , resembling the cherry color , and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange . When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us the beauty of a goldfinch . We thought we were looking at the colors flickering in burning fire . We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it would take us to victories . Indeed it did .",
      "Home kit .",
      "The Galatasaray home kit have always been fundamentally the same since 1908 . The traditional shirt of Galatasaray is the eight-piece halved design . This consists of the shirt\u2019s front , back and sleeves being made up of two colours , resulting in the shirt being split into eight parts . ( Two same colours are never next to each other within the 8 parts. ) The colours continue in an alternating order , from yellow to red . This results in the front of the shirt being the opposite of the back and the shirt also having an halved design from the side . This alternating colour order of eight parts creates a complete halved design for the shirt .",
      "The classic eight-piece halved design would become the look of Galatasaray for around 80 years , until 1985 when sportswear manufacturer Adidas began to provide the shirts and the sleeves were made up by one colour and not halved .",
      "Created over a century ago , the classic Galatasaray kit combination consists of the eight-piece halved traditional shirt , white shorts and red socks and are usually worn as part of the home strp . This changed in the mid-1980s , when sportswear manufacturer Adidas began to provide the shirts . The club reverted to the classic kit in 2012 . The official colours are Pantone shades 1235 ( yellow ) and 201 ( red ) .",
      "Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors .",

      "Ali Sami Yen Stadium .",
      "When Galatasaray were formed no Turkish teams had their own home ground , and all games in the Istanbul Football League took place at Papaz\u0131n \u00c7ay\u0131r\u0131 \u2013 now the site of Fenerbah\u00e7es \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu Stadium . In 1921 the citys first proper football stadium was constructed , Taksim Stadium , which was used as the home ground for all of Istanbuls teams . When historic Taksim Stadium was demolished in 1940 , Galatasaray decided to build a large , modern stadium . Due to difficulties stemming from World War II , construction was delayed for over two decades . In this period , they played in \u015eeref Stadi and Dolmabah\u00e7e Stadi",
      "On 20 December 1964 , Ali Sami Yen Stadium opened . Named after the founder of Galatasaray , Ali Sami Yen , it is in the Mecidiyek\u00f6y quarter of the \u015ei\u015fli district at the center of the city . In 1964 , the stadium had capacity over 35,000 . Due to improvements in security and prohibition of non-seater spectators , the all-seater capacity reduced to 22,000 in 1993 . A few years later , the rebuilt of main stand , which was damaged by an earthquake , slightly increased the capacity .",
      "After 2002 , when Atat\u00fcrk Olympic Stadium was built for Istanbuls Olympic Games bid , Galatasaray started to play European Cup matches there . The attendance record among Turkish stadiums was broken there , in Galatasaray\u2013Olympiacos match played in front of 79,414 spectators . Yet , Ali Sami Yen Stadium has historic importance for Galatasaray fans although it is smaller and older .",
      "The stadium was in 2011 demolished after Galatsaray moved to the newly built T\u00fcrk Telekom Stadium .",
      "T\u00fcrk Telekom Stadium .",

      "Stadium anthems .",
      "Since 1992 , after every goal scored by Galatasaray , the last part of the song I Will Survive by the Hermes House Band is played . Although the song is in English , the part used has no lyrics except la la la la . In addition , before every game the Galatasaray War Chant is played accompanied by what the fans call a scarf show where fans display and wave their Galatasaray scarves , banners and flags . Many people call the Turk Telekom Stadium Cehennem ( hell ) because of stadium anthems and the continuous roar of the fans .",

      "European matches .",
      "Galatasaray fans attach high importance to European competitions , and Galatasaray is known as the Conqueror of Europe by their fans .

Galatasaray fans also have a reputation in Europe as being one of the most fanatic in the world , along with ultrAslan . Ryan Giggs once said <nowiki>Ive never experienced anything like Galatasaray . Three hours before kick-off , we went out to have a look at the pitch and the stadium was overcrowded ! The chanting was brilliant : one side starts , then the other , then quiet , then all of them chanting ! The players really enjoyed it . Before it was good , after it wasnt for us.</nowiki>",

The Galatasaray\u2013Fenerbah\u00e7e rivalry is the primary Istanbul derby and the most important rivalry in Turkish football . The rivalry poses a symbolic importance to supporters due to an assumed superiority that comes with winning the derby . Supporters are often quoted as stating that winning the league without winning the derby is hollow . There is always huge interest in the derby due to its fierce nature on and off the pitch . Many documentaries have been made about the derby including an episode of The Real Football Factories International . The rivalry has led to violence among supporters on numerous occasions , though this has been on the decline in recent years . The typical features of derby days include sell out stadiums , loud support throughout the match and taunting choreography displays by supporters before kick off . Other top level \u0130stanbul derbies include the teams ; \u0130stanbul BB and Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa although these teams pose a minor rivalry as the history and the nationwide attention to the derbies among the big three is unmatched .",

      "Beginning in 1995 , Saban moderately improved Michigan States fortunes , taking the Spartans to bowl games in each of his first three seasons . From 1995 to 1997 , Michigan State finished 6\u20135\u20131 , 6\u20136 , and 7\u20135 . In comparison , MSU had finished 5\u20136 , 6\u20136 , and 5\u20136 ( prior to NCAA forfeits ) in 1992\u20131994 .",

      "Saban led the 1999 Spartans to a 9\u20132 season that included wins over Notre Dame , Michigan , Ohio State , and Penn State . The two losses were routs at the hands of Purdue and Wisconsin . Following the final regular-season game against Penn State , Saban abruptly resigned to accept the head coaching position with LSU . Sabans assistant head coach and successor , Bobby Williams , coached the Spartans to a Citrus Bowl victory over Florida , giving the Spartans an overall record of 10\u20132 for the 1999 season .

The season was somewhat marred by several lopsided losses , including a 34\u201317 loss to the Auburn Tigers , and a 41\u20139 loss to the Florida Gators .",
      "Saban led LSU to a 10\u20133 record in 2001 , including an SEC Championship and a Sugar Bowl victory . After a loss to the Ole Miss Rebels , the Tigers finished the year with six straight wins , including a win over #2 Tennessee in the 2001 SEC Championship Game , and a 47\u201334 win over Illinois in the 2002 Sugar Bowl . It was the first outright SEC championship for LSU since 1986 , and the first time the Tigers had won the Sugar Bowl since 1968 .",
      "The 2002 season opened with high expectations , but a 26\u20138 loss at the hands of Virginia Tech raised serious questions about their outlook . However , the Tigers would rebound to win their next six straight , but after a mid-season injury to quarterback Matt Mauck , LSU lost four of its last six games to close the season , including a 21\u201320 loss at Arkansas , which knocked the Tigers out of the SEC Championship Game , and forced them to share the SEC West Division title with the Razorbacks . LSU also suffered a 35\u201320 loss to Texas in the Cotton Bowl Classic , and finished 8\u20135 .",
      "The 2003 Tigers started the season with five wins , including a 17\u201310 victory in Tiger Stadium over the defending SEC champion , and then-undefeated , Georgia Bulldogs .

The Nick Saban era officially kicked off with a 34\u201310 win over the Denver Broncos in 2005 . From there , however , the Dolphins struggled , losing seven of their next nine games to fall to 3\u20137 . The two wins came over the Carolina Panthers and the New Orleans Saints , a game that took place in Tiger Stadium due to Hurricane Katrina . After a frustrating two months , however , the Dolphins would rally late in the season , as they won their final six games , including a win to end the season in Foxboro , Massachusetts over the New England Patriots . The team finished the year with a 9\u20137 record , and narrowly missed the playoffs in Sabans first season .",
      "Going into the 2006 season , the Dolphins were expected to contend for a playoff spot . The season , however , turned out to be a major disappointment . The Dolphins were considering quarterback Drew Brees , who had just been released from the San Diego Chargers due to a career-threatening shoulder injury and subsequent contract dispute , but instead signed Daunte Culpepper , who was still recovering from a knee injury from the previous season . Culpepper never fully recovered and was ultimately benched after the fourth game of the season , when the Dolphins lost to the Houston Texans . He was eventually put on injured reserve . After starting the season 1\u20136 , however , the Dolphins got hot . They won four straight games , including wins over the Chicago Bears , who were previously unbeaten and made it to the Super Bowl that year , and the Kansas City Chiefs . Suddenly , the Dolphins were back in the playoff hunt at 5\u20136 , but a 24\u201310 loss the following week to the Jacksonville Jaguars all but ended their playoff hopes . The Dolphins would rebound the following week with a 21\u20130 win over the New England Patriots . The win would be the last bright spot for the Dolphins in the 2006 season . Quarterback Joey Harrington was eventually benched in favor of third-string quarterback Cleo Lemon . While the defense was very good , the offense was anemic , with the only bright spot being running back Ronnie Brown , who gained over 1,000 rushing yards on the season . The Dolphins would lose their next two games to the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets to finish 6\u201310 , Sabans first losing season as a head coach .",

Goryachkina was rated 2313 at the time compared to Khademalshariehs rating of 2215 . Khademalsharieh also finished runner-up to Goryachkina when she won her second girls World Junior Championship in 2014 , finishing 1\u00bd points behind after 13 rounds . Goryachkina had a similar level of success in the European Youth Chess Championship . After winning a silver medal at the under-12 level in 2009 , she won gold medals in three successive years at the under-12 level in 2010 , the under-14 level in 2011 , and the under-18 level in 2012 .",
      "Goryachkina first reached a FIDE rating of 2000 in January 2009 at the age of ten , gaining 60 rating points from winning the 2008 Russian PriFR under-18 event . Her biggest yearly ratings jump took place in 2011 at the age of twelve , when she rose nearly 300 points from 2045 to 2333 . Having already earned the Womens FIDE Master ( WFM ) title , she gained 48 rating points at the 61st Womens Russian Championship FL . She then competed in her first European Individual Womens Chess Championship and scored 5\u00bd/11 , highlighted by a win against Woman Grandmaster ( WGM ) Olga Girya . Goryachkina followed this success by coming in joint first at the Czech Open and clear first at the Lyudmila Rudenko Memorial , again gaining about 48 rating points at both events . With her performance at the Czech Open , she clinched the Woman International Master ( WIM ) title and also earned a WGM norm .",
      "Following her 2011 breakthrough year , Goryachkina continued to steadily rise in rating in 2012 , reaching 2400 for the first time by January 2013 . Early in 2012 , she earned two more WGM norms , the last of which came at her second European Individual Womens Chess Championship . As she was already rated above 2300 , she became the second-youngest WGM in history at the time in March 2012 at the age of 13 years , 5 months , and 14 days , behind only Hou Yifan who achieved the feat at 12 years and 3 months old . Two other early year highlights were a victory over GM Davit Petrosian at the 2012 Aeroflot Open B , and a joint second-place finish at the Russian under-20 junior girls championship . Late in the year , she won the junior V . Dvorkovich Cup 2012 on a tiebreak over fellow future GMs Yinglun Ju and Grigoriy Oparin before closing the year as both the European and World girls under-18 champion as well as the Russian Cup for Women winner over Olga Girya .",
      "Goryachkina maintained a rating in the low 2400s throughout most of 2013 and 2014 , reaching as high as 2441 in December 2014 . She took part in the Tata Steel C Tournament in Wijk aan Zee in January 2013 , the third tier open round-robin of one of the leading annual chess tournaments in the world , scoring near the bottom at 3\u00bd/13 . She elected to compete in the open division of the Russian under-19 championship and finished runner-up with 6\u00bd/9 . With her joint second-place finish the Womens Russian Championship Higher League , she qualified for the Russian Womens Championship Superfinal for the first time . She scored 4\u00bd/9 for joint fourth place in 2013 and then scored 5\u00bd/9 for joint third in 2014 . Goryachkina also earned one International Master ( IM ) norm in 2013 and 2014 at the European Individual Womens Chess Championship and the open European Individual Chess Championship respectively . In addition to winning the girls World Junior Championships in 2013 and 2014 , she entered the open under-18 events at the World Youth Championships and scored 6\u00bd/11 both times . During 2014 , she defeated two GMs rated above 2600 in Boris Savchenko and Alexander Ipatov .",

      "Goryachkina was on the cusp of a 2500 rating throughout the second half of 2015 and first achieved it in January 2016 at the age of 17 . She earned her third and final IM norm at the 2015 European Individual Championship for the second consecutive year with a better score of 6\u00bd/11 . Although she would earn more norms over the next few years , she was never officially awarded the IM title . Goryachkina made her debut in the Womens World Chess Championship knockout event in 2015 , where she was eliminated in the second round by third seed Anna Muzychuk . Two of her best results in 2015 came towards the end of the year in Russia , where she became the Russian Womens Champion and also won the Russian Cup for Women for the second time . She won the Russian Womens Championship Superfinal with a score of 8/11 while still 16 years old . With this performance , she also earned her first GM norm .",
      "After first crossing 2500 , Goryachkina fell back into the 2400s in May 2016 and did not reach 2500 again until June 2018 , albeit never falling below 2450 over that span of two years . She did not earn any more GM norms in 2016 , at best getting three additional redundant IM norms . She could not repeat her previous years performance at the 2016 Russian Womens Championship Superfinal , only scoring 5/11 . Goryachkina began improving her rating again in 2017 . Although she again lost in the second round of the Womens World Chess Championship , she earned a second GM norm at the European Individual Womens Championship . She won a silver medal at the tournament with a score of 8/11 , a \u00bd point behind Nana Dzagnidze . At the end of year , Goryachkina won her second Russian Womens Championship . She defeated Natalia Pogonina in a rapid playoff after they finished joint first with 7/11 .",
      "Goryachkina returned to the 2500s in rating in the second half of 2018 , reaching a new peak rating of 2535 in August . In April , she earned her third and final GM norm at the Aeroflot Open A . During the tournament , she scored 4\u00bd/9 against nine players all rated between 2571 and 2625 , including eight GMs . She became the fifth-youngest woman to earn the Grandmaster title at 19 years and 5 months . As a new GM , she had another surge in rating in the Russian Championship Higher League in August , gaining 26 points with a score of 5\u00bd/9 and a performance rating of 2713 against opponents all rated above 2600 . With this increase in rating , she also became ranked in the womens top 10 for the first time . Nonetheless , she lost in the second round of the Womens World Chess Championship for the third consecutive edition and finished in joint third at the Russian Womens Championship .",
      "2019\u2013present : World Championship challenger .",
      "Goryachkina gained back most of the rating points she lost in the preceding few months at the beginning of 2019 . In particular , she scored 6\u00bd/11 at the 2019 European Individual Chess Championship in March , notably recording a win against Rauf Mamedov , who was rated 2701 at the time . She then made a major breakthrough at the Womens Candidates Tournament , which was being revived in conjunction with the dissolution of the knockout format that had been used for the past two decades . Goryachkina won the tournament by a wide margin of 1\u00bd points . She scored 9\u00bd/14 and clinched the victory with two rounds remaining by virtue of having 9 points and a 2\u00bd point lead after twelve rounds . With a dominant performance rating of 2666 , she moved up to No . 3 in the world behind only Hou Yifan and reigning Womens World Chess Champion Ju Wenjun . She also earned the right to challenge Ju for the World Championship .",
      "The Womens World Championship match took place in January 2020 , with the first half in China and the second half in Russia . In China , Ju and Goryachkina and each won a game with white .

Nevertheless , Goryachkina won the last classical game to send the match to a series of four rapid tiebreak games . After Goryachkina could not convert good winning chances in the first tiebreak game with black , Ju won the third game with white .

      "Before the World Championship match , Goryachkina played the first two legs of the 2019\u201320 FIDE Womens Grand Prix . She finished in joint second in the first leg at Skolkovo in September behind only Koneru Humpy . In the next leg at Monaco in December , she finished in joint first with Koneru and Alexandra Kosteniuk , squandering a chance at clear first with a last-round loss to Koneru . Following the World Championship match , she again finished in joint first in the third leg at Lausanne in March , this time with Nana Dzagnidze , who won on the tiebreak criteria .

      "Janet Frame",
      "Janet Paterson Frame ( 28 August 1924 \u2013 29 January 2004 ) was a New Zealand author . She was internationally renowned for her work , which included novels , short stories , poetry , juvenile fiction , and an autobiography , and received numerous awards including being appointed to the Order of New Zealand , New Zealands highest civil honour .",
      "Frames celebrity derived from her dramatic personal history as well as her literary career . Following years of psychiatric hospitalisation , Frame was scheduled for a lobotomy that was cancelled when , just days before the procedure , her debut publication of short stories was unexpectedly awarded a national literary prize . Many of her novels and short stories explore her childhood and psychiatric hospitalisation from a fictional perspective , and her award-winning three-volume autobiography was adapted into the film An Angel at My Table ( 1990 ) , directed by Jane Campion .",
      "Biography .",
      "Early years : 1924\u20131956 .",
      "Janet Frame was born Janet Paterson Frame in Dunedin in the south-east of New Zealands South Island as the third of five children of Scottish New Zealand parents . She grew up in a working-class family . Her father , George Frame , worked for the New Zealand Government Railways , and her mother Lottie ( n\u00e9e Godfrey ) , served as a housemaid to the family of writer Katherine Mansfield . New Zealands first female medical graduate , Dr Emily Hancock Siedeberg , delivered Frame at St . Helens Hospital in 1924 .",
      "Frame spent her early childhood years in various small towns in New Zealands South Island provinces of Otago and Southland , including Outram and Wyndham , before the family eventually settled in the coastal town of Oamaru ( recognisable as the Waimaru of her d\u00e9but novel and subsequent fiction ) . As recounted in the first volume of her autobiographies , Frames childhood was marred by the deaths of two of her adolescent sisters , Myrtle and Isabel , who drowned in separate incidents , and the epileptic seizures suffered by her brother George ( referred to as Geordie and Bruddie ) .",
      "In 1943 , Frame began training as a teacher at the Dunedin College of Education , auditing courses in English , French and psychology at the adjacent University of Otago . After completing two years of theoretical studies with mixed results , Frame started a year of practical placement at the Arthur Street School in Dunedin , which , according to her biographer , initially went quite well . Things started to unravel later that year when she attempted suicide by ingesting a packet of aspirin . As a result , Frame began regular therapy sessions with junior lecturer John Money , to whom she developed a strong attraction , and whose later work as a sexologist specialising in gender reassignment controversial .",
      "In September 1945 , Frame abandoned her teacher-training classroom at Dunedins Arthur Street School during a visit from an inspector . She was then briefly admitted to the psychiatric ward of the local Dunedin hospital for observation . Frame was unwilling to return home to her family , where tensions between her father and brother frequently manifested in outbursts of anger and violence . As a result , Frame was transferred from the local hospitals psychiatric ward to Seacliff Lunatic Asylum , a fabled and feared mental institution located 20 miles north of Dunedin . During the next eight years , Frame was repeatedly readmitted , usually voluntarily , to psychiatric hospitals in New Zealand . In addition to Seacliff , these included Avondale Lunatic Asylum , in Auckland , and Sunnyside Hospital in Christchurch . During this period , Frame was first diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia , which was treated with electroconvulsive therapy and insulin .",
      "In 1951 , while Frame was still a patient at Seacliff , New Zealands Caxton Press published her first book , a critically acclaimed collection of short stories titled The Lagoon and Other Stories . The volume was awarded the Hubert Church Memorial Award , at that time one of New Zealands most prestigious literary prizes . This resulted in the cancellation of Frames scheduled lobotomy . Four years later , after her final discharge from Seacliff Frame met writer Frank Sargeson . She lived and worked at his home in Takapuna , an Auckland suburb , from April 1955 to July 1956 , producing her first full-length novel , Owls Do Cry ( Pegasus , 1957 ) .",
      "Literary career .",
      "1957\u20131989 .",
      "Frame left New Zealand in late 1956 , and the next seven years were most prolific in terms of publication . She lived and worked in Europe , primarily based in London , with brief sojourns to Ibiza and Andorra . In May 1958 she legally changed her name to Nene Janet Paterson Clutha , in part to make herself more difficult to locate and in part to recognise M\u0101ori leader Tamati Waka Nene , whom she admired , and the Clutha River , which was a source of creative inspiration . Frame still struggled with anxiety and depression , and in September 1958 admitted herself to the Maudsley in London . American-trained psychiatrist Alan Miller , who studied under John Money at Johns Hopkins University , proposed that she had never suffered from schizophrenia . In an effort to alleviate the ill effects of her years spent in and out of psychiatric hospitals , Frame then began regular therapy sessions with psychiatrist Robert Hugh Cawley , who encouraged her to pursue her writing . Frame dedicated seven of her novels to Cawley .",
      "Frame returned to New Zealand in 1963 . She accepted the Burns Fellowship at the University of Otago in 1965 . She later lived in several parts of New Zealands North Island , including Auckland , Taranaki , Wanganui , the Horowhenua , Palmerston North , Waiheke , Stratford , Browns Bay and Levin .",
      "During this period Frame traveled extensively , occasionally to Europe , but principally to the United States , where she accepted residencies at the MacDowell and Yaddo artists colonies . Partly as a result of these extended stays in the U.S. , Frame developed close relationships with several Americans . These included the painter Theophilus Brown ( whom she later referred to as the chief experience of my life ) and his long-time partner Paul John Wonner , the poet May Sarton , John Phillips Marquand and Alan Lelchuck . Frames one-time university tutor/counsellor and longtime friend John Money worked in North America from 1947 onwards , and Frame frequently based herself at his home in Baltimore .",
      "In the 1980s Frame authored three volumes of autobiography ( To the Is-land , An Angel at my Table and The Envoy from Mirror City ) which collectively traced the course of her life to her return to New Zealand in 1963 . The Australian novelist Patrick White described the first two volumes as amongst the wonders of the world . Director Jane Campion and screenwriter Laura Jones adapted the trilogy for television broadcast . It was eventually released as an award-winning feature film , An Angel at My Table . Actresses Kerry Fox , Alexia Keogh and Karen Fergusson portrayed the author at various ages . Frames autobiographies sold better than any of her previous publications , and Campions successful film adaptation of the texts introduced a new generation of readers to her work . These successes increasingly pushed Frame into the public eye .",
      "In the 1983 Queens Birthday Honours , Frame was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire , for services to literature . That year , To the Is-land also received the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book of the Year Award , the top literary prize in New Zealand .",
      "Frame intended the autobiographies to set the record straight regarding her past and in particular her mental status . However , critical and public speculation has continued to focus on her mental health . In 2007 , after Frames death , The New Zealand Medical Journal published an article by a medical specialist who proposed that Frame may be on the autism spectrum , a suggestion that was disputed by the authors literary executor .",
      "During her lifetime , Frames work was principally published by American firm George Braziller , garnering numerous literary prizes in her native New Zealand , and the Commonwealth Writers Prize in 1989 for her final novel , The Carpathians .",
      "1990\u20132000 .",
      "On 6 February 1990 , Frame was the sixteenth appointee to the Order of New Zealand , the nations highest civil honour . Frame also held foreign membership of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and , in her native New Zealand , received two honorary doctorates as well as the status of cultural icon . Rumours occasionally circulated portraying Frame as a contender for the Nobel Prize in literature , most notably in 1998 , after a journalist spotted her name at the top of a list later revealed to have been in alphabetical order , and again five years later , in 2003 , when \u00c5sa Beckman , the influential chief literary critic at the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter , wrongly predicted that Frame would win the prestigious prize .",
      "Frames writing became the focus of academic criticism from the late 1970s , with approaches ranging from Marxist and social realist , to feminist and poststructuralist . In later years , book-length monographs on Frame were published . These included Patrick Evans\u2019s bio-critical contribution for the Twaynes World Authors Series , Janet Frame ( 1977 ) , Gina Mercers feminist reading of the novels and autobiographies , Janet Frame : Subversive Fictions ( 1994 ) , and Judith Dell Pannys allegorical approach to the works , I have what I gave : The fiction of Janet Frame ( 1992 ) . A collection of essays edited by Jeanne Delbaere was first published in 1978 , with a revised edition released under the title The Ring of Fire : Essays on Janet Frame in 1992 . That same year , Dunedins University of Otago hosted a conference dedicated to a discussion of Frames work . Many of the papers were published in a special issue of The Journal of New Zealand Literature .",
      "In 2000 , New Zealand historian Michael King published his authorised biography of Frame , Wrestling with the Angel . The book was simultaneously released in New Zealand and North America , with British and Australian editions appearing in later years . Kings award-winning and exhaustive work attracted both praise and criticism . Some questioned the extent to which Frame guided the hand of her biographer , while others argued that he had failed to come to terms with the complexity and subtlety of his subject . Adding to the controversy , King openly admitted that he withheld information that would have been a source of embarrassment and distress to her , and that he adopted publisher Christine Cole Catleys notion of compassionate truth . This advocates a presentation of evidence and conclusions that fulfil the major objectives of biography , but without the revelation of information that would involve the living subject in unwarranted embarrassment , loss of face , emotional or physical pain , or a nervous or psychiatric collapse . King defended his project and maintained that future biographies on Frame would eventually fill in the gaps left by his own work .",
      "Death and posthumous publications .",
      "Frame died in Dunedin in January 2004 , aged 79 , from acute myeloid leukaemia , shortly after becoming one of the first recipients of the Arts Foundation of New Zealand Icon Awards , established to celebrate and acknowledge New Zealand artists who have achieved the highest standards of artistic expression . A number of posthumous works have been published since her death , including a volume of poetry titled The Goose Bath , which was awarded New Zealands top poetry prize in 2007 . This generated a minor controversy among critics who felt the posthumous prize set an awkward precedent . A novella , Towards Another Summer , was also published posthumously , a work inspired by a weekend Frame spent with British journalist Geoffrey Moorhouse and his family . In 2008 , two previously unpublished short stories set in mental hospitals appeared in The New Yorker . Another previously unpublished short story was carried in The New Yorker in 2010 . In March 2011 , the New Zealand branch of Penguin Books acquired the rights to publish three new editions of Frames work . These were : Janet Frame in Her Own Words ( 2011 ) , a collection of interviews and nonfiction , Gorse is Not People : New and Uncollected Stories ( 2012 ) ( Published in the US as Between My Father and the King : New and Uncollected Stories ) , and the novel In the Memorial Room ( 2013 ) .",
      "In 2010 , Gifted , a novel by New Zealand academic and former Frame biographer Patrick Evans , was published and subsequently shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize . The story is a fictionalised account of the relationship between Janet Frame and Frank Sargeson during her time living as a guest on his Takapuna property in 1955\u201356 \u2013 an era recounted in a number of works by Frame and her contemporaries and dramatised in Campions film , An Angel at My Table ( 1990 ) . In 2013 , Evans novel was adapted for the stage , premiering at the Christchurch Arts Festival on 22 August 2013 , followed by extended tour of New Zealands north and south islands . While garnering positive critical reviews , the promotion and staging of the production drew fierce criticism from Frames literary executor and niece , Pamela Gordon , who maintained it was designed to demean Frame . Gordon , who has also criticised Campions film for inaccuracies in its portrayal of Frame , asserted that Evans theatrical adaptation presented an unfaithful view of her famous relative . Festival organiser Philip Tremewan , defended the play , while director Conrad Newport maintained that Gordon was overprotective of [ Frames ] legacy . Evans generally avoided the controversy , stating , I have publicised her work and popularised it for two to three generations of students . In Gifted , the play and novel , you only have to look at the title to see what my attitude is . I really dont think I have anything to apologise for .",

      "Fernand Braudel",
      "Fernand Braudel ( ; 24 August 1902 \u2013 27 November 1985 ) was a French historian and a leader of the Annales School . His scholarship focused on three main projects : The Mediterranean ( 1923\u201349 , then 1949\u201366 ) , Civilization and Capitalism ( 1955\u201379 ) , and the unfinished Identity of France ( 1970\u201385 ) . His reputation stems in part from his writings , but even more from his success in making the Annales School the most important engine of historical research in France and much of the world after 1950 . As the dominant leader of the Annales School of historiography in the 1950s and 1960s , he exerted enormous influence on historical writing in France and other countries . He was a student of Henri Hauser ( 1866-1946 ) .",
      "Braudel has been considered one of the greatest of the modern historians who have emphasized the role of large-scale socioeconomic factors in the making and writing of history . He can also be considered as one of the precursors of world-systems theory . In his works Braudel shows a revolutionary change of focus in the craft and analysis of history from individuals or events to world systems .",
      "Biography .",
      "Braudel was born in Lum\u00e9ville-en-Ornois ( as of 1943 , merged with and part of Gondrecourt-le-Ch\u00e2teau ) , in the d\u00e9partement of the Meuse , France . His father , who was a natural mathematician , aided him in his studies . Braudel also studied a good deal of Latin and a little Greek . At the age of 7 , his family moved to Paris . Braudel was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Voltaire and the Sorbonne , where at the age of 20 he was awarded an agr\u00e9g\u00e9 in history . While teaching at the University of Algiers between 1923 and 1932 , he became fascinated by the Mediterranean Sea and wrote several papers on the Spanish presence in Algeria in the 16th century . During this time , Braudel began his doctoral thesis on the foreign policy of King Philip II of Spain . From 1932 to 1935 he taught in the Paris lyc\u00e9es ( secondary schools or high schools ) of Pasteur , Condorcet , and Henri-IV .",
      "By 1900 , the French solidified their cultural influence in Brazil through the establishment of the Brazilian Academy of Fine Arts . S\u00e3o Paulo still lacked a university , however , and in 1934 francophile Julio de Mesquita Filho invited anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Braudel to help establish one . The result was formation of the new University of S\u00e3o Paulo . Braudel later said that the time in Brazil was the greatest period of his life .",
      "In 1937 , Braudel returned to Paris from Brazil . However , the journey was as significant as arriving at his destination ; on his way , he met Lucien Febvre , who was the co-founder of the influential Annales journal . The two had booked passage on the same ship . Braudel had started archival research on his doctorate on the Mediterranean when he fell under the influence of the Annales School around 1938 . Also around this time he entered the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes as an instructor in history . He worked with Lucien Febvre , who would later read the early versions of Braudels magnum opus and provide him with editorial advice .",
      "At the outbreak of war in 1939 , he was called up for military service and in 1940 was taken prisoner by the Germans . He was held at a POW camp in Mainz from 1940 to 1942 before being transferred to a POW camp near L\u00fcbeck , where he remained for the rest of the war . While in that camp , Braudel drafted his great work La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et le Monde M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en \u00e0 l\u00e9poque de Philippe II ( The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II ) , without access to his books or notes and relying only on his prodigious memory and a local library .",
      "Braudel became the leader of the second generation of Annales historians after 1945 . In 1947 , with Febvre and Charles Moraz\u00e9 , Braudel obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the noted Sixi\u00e8me Section for Economic and social sciences at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes . He received an additional $1 million from the Ford Foundation in 1960 .",
      "In 1962 , he and Gaston Berger used the Ford Foundation grant and government funds to create a new independent foundation , the Fondation Maison des Sciences de lHomme ( FMSH ) , which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death . It was housed in the building called Maison des Sciences de lHomme . FMSH focused its activities on international networking in order to disseminate the Annales approach to Europe and the world . In 1972 he gave up all editorial responsibility on the journal , although his name remained on the masthead .",
      "In 1962 , he wrote A History of Civilizations as the basis for a history course , but its rejection of the traditional event-based narrative was too radical for the French ministry of education , which in turn rejected it .",
      "A feature of Braudels work was his compassion for the suffering of marginal people . He articulated that most surviving historical sources come from the literate wealthy classes . He emphasized the importance of the ephemeral lives of slaves , serfs , peasants , and the urban poor , demonstrating their contributions to the wealth and power of their respective masters and societies . His work was often illustrated with contemporary depictions of daily life , rarely with pictures of noblemen or kings .",
      "In 1949 , Braudel was elected to the Coll\u00e8ge de France upon Febvres retirement . He co-founded the academic journal , Revue \u00e9conomique , in 1950 . He retired in 1968 . In 1983 , he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise .",
      "La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e .",
      "His first book , La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et le Monde M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en \u00e0 lEpoque de Philippe II ( 1949 ) ( The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II ) was his most influential and has been described as a watershed .",
      "For Braudel there is no single Mediterranean Sea . There are many seas\u2014indeed a vast , complex expanse within which men operate . Life is conducted on the Mediterranean : people travel , fish , fight wars , and drown in its various contexts . And the sea articulates with the plains and islands . Life on the plains is diverse and complex ; the poorer south is affected by religious diversity ( Catholicism and Islam ) , as well as by intrusions \u2013 both cultural and economic \u2013 from the north . In other words , the Mediterranean cannot be understood independently from what is exterior to it . Any rigid adherence to boundaries falsifies the situation .",
      "The first level of time , geographical time , is that of the environment , with its slow , almost imperceptible change , its repetition and cycles . Such change may be slow , but it is irresistible . The second level of time comprises long-term social , economic , and cultural history , where Braudel discusses the Mediterranean economy , social groupings , empires and civilizations . Change at this level is much more rapid than that of the environment ; Braudel looks at two or three centuries in order to spot a particular pattern , such as the rise and fall of various aristocracies . The third level of time is that of events ( histoire \u00e9v\u00e9nementielle ) . This is the history of individuals with names . This , for Braudel , is the time of surfaces and deceptive effects . It is the time of the courte dur\u00e9e proper and it is the focus of Part 3 of The Mediterranean which treats of events , politics and people .",
      "Braudels Mediterranean is centered on the sea , but just as important , it is also the desert and the mountains . The desert creates a nomadic form of social organization where the whole community moves ; mountain life is sedentary . Transhumance \u2014 that is , the movement from the mountain to the plain , or vice versa in a given season \u2014 is also a persistent part of Mediterranean existence .",
      "Braudels vast , panoramic view used insights from other social sciences , employed the concept of the longue dur\u00e9e , and downplayed the importance of specific events . It was widely admired , but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs . The book firmly launched the study of the Mediterranean and dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School .",
      "Capitalism .",
      "After La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e , Braudels most famous work is Civilisation Mat\u00e9rielle , \u00c9conomie et Capitalisme , XV-XVIII ( Civilization and Capitalism , 15th-18th Century ) . The first volume was published in 1967 , and was translated to English in 1973 . The last of the three-volume work appeared in 1979 . The work is a broad-scale history of the pre-industrial modern world , presented in the minute detail demanded by the methodological school called cliometrics , and focusing on how regular people made economies work . Like all Braudels major works , the book mixed traditional economic material with thick description of the social impact of economic events on various facets of everyday life , including food , fashion , and other social customs . The third volume , subtitled The Perspective of the World , was strongly influenced by the work of German scholars like Werner Sombart . In this volume , Braudel traced the impact of the centers of Western capitalism on the rest of the world . Braudel wrote the series both as a way of explanation for the modern way and partly as a refutation of the Marxist view of history .",
      "Braudel discussed the idea of long-term cycles in the capitalist economy that he saw developing in Europe in the 12th century . Particular cities , and later nation-states , follow each other sequentially as centers of these cycles : Venice in the 13th through the 15th centuries ( 1250\u20131510 ) ; Antwerp and Genoa in the 16th century ( 1500\u20131569 and 1557\u20131627 , respectively ) , Amsterdam in the 16th through 18th centuries ( 1627\u20131733 ) ; and London ( and England ) in the 18th and 19th centuries ( 1733\u20131896 ) . He used the word structures to denote a variety of social structures , such as organized behaviours , attitudes , and conventions , as well as physical structures and infrastructures . He argued that the structures established in Europe during the Middle Ages contributed to the successes of present-day European-based cultures . He attributed much of this to the long-standing independence of city-states , which , though later subjugated by larger geographic states , were not always completely suppressed\u2014probably for reasons of utility .",
      "Braudel argued that capitalists have typically been monopolists and not , as is usually assumed , entrepreneurs operating in competitive markets . He argued that capitalists did not specialize and did not use free markets , thus diverging from both liberal ( Adam Smith ) and Marxian interpretations . In Braudels view , the state in capitalist countries has served as a guarantor of monopolists rather than a protector of competition , as it is usually portrayed . He asserted that capitalists have had power and cunning on their side as they have arrayed themselves against the majority of the population .",
      "An agrarian structure is a long-term structure in the Braudelian understanding of the concept . On a larger scale the agrarian structure is more dependent on the regional , social , cultural and historical factors than on the states undertaken activities .",
      "LIdentit\u00e9 de la France .",
      "Braudels last and most personal book was LIdentit\u00e9 de la France ( The Identity of France ) , which was unfinished at the time of his death in 1985 . Unlike many of Braudels other books , he made no secret of his profound love of his country , remarking at the beginning that he had loved France as if she were a woman . Reflecting his interest with the longue dur\u00e9e , Braudels concern in LIdentit\u00e9 de la France was with the centuries and millennia instead of the years and decades . Braudel argued that France was the product not of its politics or economics but rather of its geography and culture , a thesis Braudel explored in a wide-ranging book that saw the bourg and the patois : historie totale integrated into a broad sweep of both the place and the time . Unlike Braudels other books , LIdentit\u00e9 de la France was much colored by a romantic nostalgia , as Braudel argued for the existence of la France profonde , a deep France based upon the peasant mentalit\u00e9 that despite all of the turmoil of French history and the Industrial Revolution had survived intact right up to the present .",
      "Historiography .",
      "According to Braudel , before the Annales approach , the writing of history was focused on the courte dur\u00e9e ( short span ) , or on histoire \u00e9v\u00e9nementielle ( a history of events ) .",
      "His followers admired his use of the longue dur\u00e9e approach to stress the slow and often imperceptible effects of space , climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past . The Annales historians , after living through two world wars and massive political upheavals in France , were very uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history . They preferred to stress inertia and the longue dur\u00e9e , arguing that the continuities in the deepest structures of society were central to history . Upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance , for history , they argued , lies beyond the reach of conscious actors , especially the will of revolutionaries . They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions . A proponent of historical materialism , Braudel rejected Marxist materialism , stressing the equal importance of infrastructure and superstructure , both of which reflected enduring social , economic , and cultural realities . Braudels structures , both mental and environmental , determine the long-term course of events by constraining actions on , and by , humans over a duration long enough that they are beyond the consciousness of the actors involved .",
      "Recognition .",

      "Tibbers Castle",
      "Tibbers Castle is a motte-and-bailey castle overlooking a ford across the River Nith in Dumfries and Galloway , Scotland . To the east is the village of Carronbridge and to the north west is a 16th-century country house , Drumlanrig Castle .",
      "Possibly built in the 12th or 13th century , Tibbers was first documented in 1298 at which point the timber castle was replaced by a stone castle . It was the administrative centre of the barony of Tibbers until the second half of the 14th century when it shifted to nearby Morton . During the Anglo-Scottish Wars of the early 14th century the castle was captured by first the Scots under Robert the Bruce and then the English , before returning to Scottish control in 1313 .",
      "The castle descended through the Earls of Moray and subsequently the Earls of March before coming under the control of the Scottish Crown . A toun was established near the castle . While it is unclear at what point Tibbers Castle fell out of use , by the 18th century the site was used for agriculture . Archaeological investigations took place in 1864 , 1912 , and 2013\u20132014 .",
      "History .",
      "The origin of Tibbers Castle is undocumented , and it may have been founded in the 12th or 13th century as a timber castle . It was first recorded in 1298 when Sir Richard Siward , either built the stone enclosure castle or enhanced one which had already been added to the timber structure . King Edward I of England visited the castle the same year . Siward was the Sheriff of Dumfries when the area was under the control of the English and documentation from this period gives some evidence for activity at the castle . In 1302 , \u00a3100 was spent on the structured while it was manned by a 23-strong garrison .",
      "The death of Alexander III of Scotland in 1286 led to a succession crisis resulting in English rule of Scotland under Edward I . Robert the Bruces family was one of the claimants and in 1306 he was crowned king , leading to war with England . The first phase of Bruces campaign in 1306 was to capture the English-held castles of Ayr , Dalswinton , Inverkip and Tibbers . Control was given to John de Seton until the English recaptured the castle from the Scots , hanging the defenders , and a larger garrison , this time numbering 54 , was installed . In 1313 the Scots regained control of the region . From there Tibbers Castle remained in Scottish hands , and was possessed by Thomas Randolph , 1st Earl of Moray . He was succeeded by Thomas Randolph , 2nd Earl of Moray and John Randolph , 3rd Earl of Moray . When John died at the battle of Nevilles Cross in 1346 the earldom along with Tibbers Castle was given to Patrick , Earl of March . His son inherited in 1369 and acquired the barony of Morton which probably became the administrative centre for the barony of Tibbers . The estates descended through the Dunbar family until 1435 when their lands were confiscated by the Scottish Crown . In 1450 or 1451 , King James II of Scotland subsequently gave Tibbers to George Crichton , Lord High Admiral of Scotland and later the 1st Earl of Caithness . When he died in 1454 the property again came under royal control .",
      "A toun or township at Tibbers was mentioned in 1451 , and the presence of the castle did not prevent the town from being attacked by Sir Alexander Stewart of Garlies in 1547 . It is unclear when Tibbers Castle fell out of use , but in the 18th century , the ridge on which the castle sits was used to grow crops . Part of the structure was demolished to reuse materials such as lime . The Mote de Tibbris is mentioned in the Registrum Magni Sigilli in 1489 and 1541 .",
      "The interpretation of Tibbers has changed over time , and in the 18th century it was thought to be a Roman fort though it was later understood to be a medieval castle . The name of the castle led to the suggestion that it derived from Tiberius Caesar , however Tibbers comes from the Gaelic word Toibar meaning a well . The earliest recorded excavation at Tibbers Castle took place in 1864 , which recovered two coins from the reign of Edward II of England ( 1307\u20131327 ) and a dagger from the early 15th century . The site was surveyed in 1912 with no further archaeological investigation until the 21st century . It was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937 . In 2013 and 2014 the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland carried out measured and geophysical ( using resistivity and a gradiometer ) surveys at Tibbers with funding from Historic Scotland and the Castle Studies Trust .",
      "Layout .",
      "Occupying a ridge on the west bank of the River Nith , the earliest phase of the castle consisted of a small bailey or enclosure . This bailey was revealed by the geophysical survey in 2014 which also indicated that it contained timber buildings .",
      "When Richard Siward remodelled the castle it is likely that he added the motte with its stone enclosure castle and replaced the single small bailey with two large enclosures south of the motte . These enclosures may have housed a market as was the case at Lochmaben Castle . There are few examples in Scotland of earthwork castles being rebuilt in stone . The four-sided motte measures at the summit . The enclosure castle on top is roughly rectangular , measuring , with a round tower at each corner . Little survives above ground of this structure , though the south-south-east tower survives best . The south side of the enclosure castle had an additional tower which tower with the south-south-east corner tower flanked the entrance . Inside , the castle had a well on the east side and a range of buildings extending along the west and north sides ; these likely contained a great hall , the kitchens , and a chamber . There was a postern gate just south of the north-east tower . This phase of Tibbers is one of the few authentic surviving remnants of English castle building in Scotland during the Plantagenet occupation .",
      "At its greatest extent Tibbers Castle measured by . The courtyard of the enclosure castle is the inner bailey . The outer and outermost baileys each cover an area of about . The ramparts enclosing the site survive to a height of and are between wide . Double baileys are uncommon , with examples at Windsor and Llandinam ."

      "HMAS Wollongong ( J172 )",
      "HMAS Wollongong ( J172 ) , named for the city of Wollongong , New South Wales , was one of 60 s constructed during World War II and one of 20 built for the Admiralty but manned by personnel of and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) .",
      "Design and construction .",
      "In 1938 , the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board ( ACNB ) identified the need for a general purpose local defence vessel capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties , while easy to construct and operate . The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons , a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel , with a top speed , and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun , equipped with asdic , and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations : although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel , the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels . Construction of the prototype did not go ahead , but the plans were retained . The need for locally built all-rounder vessels at the start of World War II saw the Australian Minesweepers ( designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability , but popularly referred to as corvettes ) approved in September 1939 , with 60 constructed during the course of the war : 36 ordered by the RAN , 20 ( including Wollongong ) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels , and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy .",
      "Wollongong was laid down by Cockatoo Docks & Engineering Company on 29 January 1941 . She was launched on 5 July 1941 , by the wife of Jack Beasley , then Minister for Supply and Shipping , and was commissioned into the RAN on 23 October 1941 .",
      "Operational history .",
      "World War II .",
      "After entering active service , Wollongong was deployed as a convoy escort in Australian waters . On 11 January 1942 , she was sent to Singapore . The corvette was involved in patrols and the evacuation of Allied personnel from Malaya , Java , and Sumatra , and was the last Australian ship to leave Singapore before it was surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February . She then provided a rear escort to a convoy fleeing Tanjong Priok , Batavia . During this , Wollongong , stood by the tanker , which ran aground and eventually had to be abandoned , was forced to sink the minesweeper , which attempted to turn back to the captured port , and broke off from the convoy to escort the damaged SS British Judge , which was torpedoed on the night of 28 February and could not keep up . The main convoy and the escorting sloop was sunk on 4 March by a Japanese cruiser group .",
      "Wollongong was then ordered to Fremantle , where she served as an escort ship before sailing on 14 September to Diego Garcia to join the British Eastern Fleet . She operated in the Indian Ocean , Persian Gulf , Arabian Sea , and Mediterranean as a convoy escort and patrol vessel , and twice entered the Atlantic Ocean to meet Mediterranean-bound convoys . In September 1943 , while in the Mediterranean , Wollongong was called on to shell the beached German submarine U-617 , and was awarded partial credit for the submarines destruction .",
      "Wollongong returned to Australian waters in February 1945 , then was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet . The corvette was involved in the Battle of Okinawa . After the end of World War II , Wollongong was sent to the Far East , where she was involved in anti-piracy patrols , before returning to Australia at the end of 1945 .",
      "The ship received six battle honours for her wartime service : Pacific 1942\u201345 , Indian Ocean 1942\u201345 , Sicily 1943 , Mediterranean 1943 , East Indies 1943 , and Okinawa 1945 .",
      "RNLN service .",
      "After the end of the war , Wollongong was marked for transfer to the Royal Netherlands Navy ( RNLN ) . She was decommissioned in Sydney on 11 February 1946 , was recommissioned into the RNLN , and renamed HNLMS Banda .",
      "The corvette remained with the RNLN until April 1950 .",
      "TNI-AL service .",
      "The ship was transferred to the new Indonesian Navy in April 1950 , and was renamed KRI Radjawali .",
      "The corvette left service in early 1968 , and was scrapped in Hong Kong ."
